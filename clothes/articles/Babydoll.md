A **babydoll** is a short, sometimes sleeveless, loose-fitting
[nightgown](/nightgown "wikilink") or [negligee](/negligee "wikilink"),
intended as [nightwear](/nightwear "wikilink") for women. It sometimes
has formed cups called a
[bralette](/List_of_brassiere_designs "wikilink") for
[cleavage](/Cleavage_(breasts) "wikilink") with an attached,
loose-fitting [skirt](/skirt "wikilink") falling in length usually
between the belly button and upper thigh. The garment is often trimmed
with [lace](/lace "wikilink"), ruffles,
[appliques](/appliques "wikilink"),
[marabou](/marabou_(fashion) "wikilink"), bows, and ribbons, optionally
with [spaghetti straps](/spaghetti_strap "wikilink"). Sometimes it is
made of [sheer](/Sheer_(textile) "wikilink") or translucent fabric such
as [nylon](/nylon "wikilink") or [chiffon](/chiffon_(fabric) "wikilink")
or [silk](/silk "wikilink").

## History

The creation of the super-short nightgown is attributed to the American
lingerie designer [Sylvia Pedlar](/Sylvia_Pedlar "wikilink"), who
produced them in 1942 in response to fabric shortages during [World War
II](/World_War_II "wikilink").[1] Although her designs became known as
"babydolls", Pedlar disliked the name and did not use it.[2]

The name was popularized by the 1956 movie *[Baby
Doll](/Baby_Doll "wikilink")*, starring [Carroll
Baker](/Carroll_Baker "wikilink") in the title role as a 19-year-old
[nymphet](/Lolita_(term) "wikilink"). This marked the beginning of the
enduring popularity of the style for adults. Babydoll pajamas in the
1950s through the 1960s consisted of a top and a loose fitting short
bloomer bottom with elasticized waist and legs. In the 1970s through the
1990s, the bloomer bottom was replaced by closer fitting briefs with
elastic waist and legs. The most recent versions of babydoll pajamas
have eliminated the elastic on the legs, the bottoms being either shorts
or [tap pants](/tap_pants "wikilink").

Babydolls became a prominent part of the
"[kinderwhore](/kinderwhore "wikilink")" look during the
early-to-mid-1990s, due to the popularity of [riot
Grrrl](/riot_Grrrl "wikilink") and [grunge](/grunge "wikilink")
performers such as [Courtney Love](/Courtney_Love "wikilink") and [Kat
Bjelland](/Kat_Bjelland "wikilink").

## Contemporary styles

Babydolls are now considered an eroticized item of adult apparel, often
classified as a form of [lingerie](/lingerie "wikilink"). Adult
babydolls are quite different from the infant babydolls; they fully
expose the woman's legs, and some styles emphasize or deliberately
expose the breasts as well. The gown is often sold as a set with
matching [panties](/panties "wikilink"), as a typical babydoll is short
enough that underwear is visible if worn. Styles of the same general
length but not intended to emphasize sex appeal are sometimes called
[shortie nightgowns](/nightgown "wikilink").

Babydolls are available in a sufficiently wide variety of styles that
many lingerie retailers consider babydolls a distinct department. Modern
babydolls often vary considerably from the styles of the 1960s and
1970s. Babydoll negligees from the 1950s to the early 1980s are now
collectible vintage items. Some babydolls open in front and resemble a
robe or [peignoir](/peignoir "wikilink").

Short daywear dresses of a similar style are sometimes called *babydoll
dresses*; the name is sometimes two words, *baby doll*, and sometimes
hyphenated, *baby-doll*. Some styles are similar to what is worn by some
infants; and by dolls designed like infants. The
[gown](/gown "wikilink") or top is short enough that
[diapers](/diaper "wikilink") may be easily changed. An alternative
origin for the style may be the lace-trimmed shortie
[bedjackets](/bedjacket "wikilink") and bed-capes of the 1930s and
1940s.

In the 21st century, babydolls have become popular as [bridal
lingerie](/bridal_lingerie "wikilink"). They are more affordable than a
bridal [corset](/corset "wikilink") and often offer a greater choice of
designs and colours.
