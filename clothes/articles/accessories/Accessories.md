An accessory is a type of [clothes](/clothes "wikilink") that
complements and accentuates garments. In combination with additional
garments and accessories, it constitutes an
[outfit](/Outfits "wikilink"). Because it cannot be worn without a
garment, the accessory mainly serves as a variable for clothes in the
fashion system. Despite its supplementary nature, the choice of an
accessory can influence the meaning of a garment or an outfit greatly.
Because of this reason, accessories are available in varieties of
[themes](/themes "wikilink") and [styles](/styles "wikilink") for
personal customization.
