refers to bags originating from the
[Philippines](/Philippines "wikilink") made by weaving dried leaves. The
leaves used for making the bayong vary but the traditional bayong is
made from [buri](/Buri_palm "wikilink") leaves in the
[Visayas](/Visayas "wikilink") and [pandan](/Pandan_plant "wikilink")
leaves in [Luzon](/Luzon "wikilink").[1][2] [Abaca](/Abaca "wikilink"),
bacbac, karagumoy, sabutan, romblon and tikog are among other organic
materials used in making the bayong â€” all of which are derived from
plants native to the Philippines.[3][4]Plastic strips are also used as
synthetic substitute for leaves.[5]

The use of Bayong is common among Filipinos going to [wet
markets](/wet_markets "wikilink") especially in rural areas or
provinces. Recently the bayong is being promoted as an
environmentally-friendly alternative to plastic shopping bags.[6][7]
