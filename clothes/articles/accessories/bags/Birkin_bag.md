[300px\|thumb\|Birkin bag made from calf leather that has been dyed
pink](/File:Pink_Birkin_bag.jpg "wikilink") The **Birkin bag** is a
personal accessory of [luggage](/luggage "wikilink") or a
[tote](/tote_bag "wikilink") by [Hermès](/Hermès "wikilink") that is
handmade in leather and named after actress and singer [Jane
Birkin](/Jane_Birkin "wikilink"). Introduced in the 1980s, the bag
quickly became a [symbol of wealth](/status_symbol "wikilink") and
exclusivity due to its high price and long waiting lists,[1] and was
once seen as the rarest handbag in the world.[2] Birkins are the most
popular bag with [handbag
collectors](/Handbag_collecting "wikilink").[3]

Its prices range from US$9,550 (for a 25 cm base Birkin) to $300,000.
Costs escalate according to the type of leather and if exotic skins were
used. The bags are distributed to Hermès boutiques on unpredictable
schedules and in limited quantities, which created [artificial
scarcity](/artificial_scarcity "wikilink") and exclusivity; however,
Birkins have flooded the upscale resale market and are frequently sold
in second-hand boutiques and through social media.[4]

## History

[150px\|thumb\|Jane Birkin, 1985](/File:Jane_Birkin07.JPG "wikilink") In
1983, Hermès chief executive [Jean-Louis
Dumas](/Jean-Louis_Dumas "wikilink") was seated next to [Jane
Birkin](/Jane_Birkin "wikilink") on a flight from Paris to London.
Birkin had just placed her straw travelling bag in the overhead
compartment for her seat, but the contents fell to the deck, leaving her
to scramble to replace them. Birkin explained to Dumas that it had been
difficult to find a leather weekend bag she liked.[5]

In 1984, he created a black supple leather bag for her,[6][7] based on a
1982 design. She used the bag initially, but changed her mind because
she was carrying too many things in it: "What's the use of having a
second one?" she said laughingly. "You only need one and that busts your
arm; they're bloody heavy. I'm going to have to have an operation for
[tendonitis](/Tendinitis "wikilink") in the shoulder."[8] Nevertheless,
since that time, the bag has become a [status
symbol](/status_symbol "wikilink"), though is far more easily attainable
thanks to resales.[9]

In July 2015, however, Birkin asked Hermès to stop using her name for
the crocodile version due to ethical concerns,[10] as
[PETA](/PETA "wikilink") alleged crocodile farms supplying the hide to
Hermès for the manufacture of the bags crammed their animals into barren
concrete pits. "At just one year old, alligators are shot with a
captive-bolt gun or crudely cut into while they're still conscious and
able to feel pain," PETA said. Birkin is quoted as having asked Hermes
"to debaptise the Birkin Croco until better practices in line with
international norms can be put in place".[11][12][13][14]

## Design

Birkin bags are sold in a range of sizes. Each one may be made to order
with different customer-chosen hides, colour, and hardware fixtures.
There are other individual options, such as diamond-encrusting.

-   The bag also comes in a variety of hides such as calf leather,
    [lizard](/lizard "wikilink"), and
    [ostrich](/ostrich "wikilink").[15] Among the most expensive used to
    be [saltwater crocodile](/saltwater_crocodile "wikilink") skin and
    bags with smaller scales cost more than those with larger scales.
    Each bag is lined with goat-skin, the colour of the interior
    matching the exterior. Prices for the Birkin bag depend on type of
    skin, the colour, and hardware fixtures.[16]
-   Sizes range from 25-, 30-, 35-, to 40-centimetres, with travelling
    bags of 50- and 55-centimetres. It also comes in a variety of
    colours such as black, brown, golden tan, navy blue, olive green,
    orange, pink, powder blue, red, and white.[17]

-   The bag has a lock and keys.[18] The keys are enclosed in a leather
    [lanyard](/lanyard "wikilink") known as a *clochette*, carried by
    looping it through a handle. The bag is locked by closing the top
    flaps over buckle loops, wrapping the buckle straps, or closing the
    lock on the front hardware. Locks and keys are number-coded. Early
    locks only bore one number on the bottom of the lock. In more recent
    years, Hermès has added a second number under the Hermes stamp of
    the lock. The numbers for locks may be the same for hundreds of
    locks, as they are batch numbers in which the locks were made.
-   The metallic hardware (the lock, keys, buckle hardware, and base
    studs) are plated with gold or [palladium](/palladium "wikilink").
    Detailing with [diamonds](/diamonds "wikilink") is another custom
    option.[19]
-   Hermès offers a "spa treatment" – a reconditioning for heavily used
    bags.
-   A "Shooting Star" Birkin has a metallic image resembling a shooting
    star, stamped adjacent to the "Hermès, Paris Made in France" stamp,
    that is in gold or silver to match the hardware and embossing.
    Rarely, the stamp is blind or colourless, if the bag is made of one
    or two leathers onto which no metallic stamping is used. Sometimes,
    Birkins or other Hermès bags may be made by independent artisans for
    "personal use", but only once a year. Every bag bears the stamp of
    the artisan who made the bag. These identifications vary widely, but
    are not different for every bag made. Finding stamps of more than
    one artisan on a bag occurs because the stamp is not a serial
    reference. Fonts and the order of stamping may vary, depending on
    the artisans.
-   The Birkin bag may be distinguished from the similar Hermès [Kelly
    handbag](/Kelly_handbag "wikilink") by the number of its handles.
    The single-handle handbag is the Kelly, but the Birkin has two
    handles.

## Craftsmanship

The bags are handmade in France using the company's signature saddle
stitching, developed in the 1800s.[20] Each bag is hand-sewn, buffed,
painted, and polished, taking several days to finish. Leathers are
obtained from different tanners in France, resulting in varying smells
and textures. The company justifies the cost of the Birkin bag, compared
to other bags, claiming the degree of craftsmanship involved.[21]

## Demand

According to a 2014 estimate, Hermès produced 70,000 Birkin bags that
year.[22] The bag is highly coveted and, for several years, was reputed
to have a waiting list of up to six years.[23] The rarity of these bags
is purportedly designed to increase demand by collectors.[24]

As a result of the strong demand, the Birkin bag has a high resale value
in many countries, especially in Asia,[25] and to such an extent that
the bag is considered by some people as an instrument of investment.[26]
One 2016 study found that Birkin bags had average annual returns of
14.2% between 1980 and 2015, significantly beating the [S&P 500
Index](/S&P_500_Index "wikilink").[27] In April 2010, Hermès announced
that the waiting list would no longer exist, implying that it is
potentially available to all.[28]

*[The Philippine Star](/The_Philippine_Star "wikilink")* reported in
March 2013, that a very high-end, 30-cm Shiny Rouge H Porosus Crocodile
Birkin with 18K gold fittings and encrusted with diamonds fetched
US$203,150 at an auction in [Dallas,
Texas](/Dallas,_Texas "wikilink").[29] A 30 centimeter matte white
Himalaya niloticus crocodile Birkin with 18-carat white gold and
hardware bearing 245 diamonds was sold at a Christie's auction in Hong
Kong for HK$2.94 million (US$377,261), creating a new record for the
most expensive handbag in the world. A similar one had been sold by
Christie's in spring 2016 for a then-world-record price of
HK$2.33 million (US$300,000).[30]

According to an analyst quoted by *[The New York
Times](/The_New_York_Times "wikilink")* in 2019, there are more than 1
million Birkin bags on the market, while a resale boutique in Miami has
sold more than $60 million in used Birkin bags in just five years.[31]

## In popular culture

The Birkin bag is a major plot point of the *[Sex and the
City](/Sex_and_the_City "wikilink")* episode "Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda"
([Season 4](/Sex_and_the_City_(season_4) "wikilink")), in which
[Samantha](/Samantha_Jones_(Sex_and_the_City) "wikilink") is placed on a
five-year waiting list for the bag. She is so desperate to obtain one
that she falsely says the bag is for her celebrity client [Lucy
Liu](/Lucy_Liu "wikilink"). When Liu finds out she fires Samantha and
keeps the bag for herself.[32]

In his 2008 memoir, *Bringing Home the Birkin; My Life in Hot Pursuit of
the World'’s Most Coveted Handbag,* author [Michael
Tonello](/Michael_Tonello "wikilink"), recounted his career selling used
luxury goods on eBay.[33]

In her 2015 memoir *The Primates of Park Avenue*, author [Wednesday
Martin](/Wednesday_Martin "wikilink") recounts how Birkin bags signal
social class status on the [Upper East
Side](/Upper_East_Side "wikilink").[34]

In the *[Will & Grace](/Will_&_Grace "wikilink")* [season
6](/Will_&_Grace_(season_6) "wikilink") episode "Last Ex to Brooklyn",
Grace is gifted a Birkin by her husband's ex-girlfriend Diane ([Mira
Sorvino](/Mira_Sorvino "wikilink")), who works at
*[Vogue](/Vogue_(magazine) "wikilink")*. Will angrily says that he has
been on a two-year waiting list for the bag.[35]

In the *[Gilmore Girls](/Gilmore_Girls "wikilink")* [season
6](/Gilmore_Girls_(season_6) "wikilink") episode "Welcome to the
Dollhouse", Rory is gifted a Birkin by her boyfriend Logan. Emily says
that around her birthday she had hinted to Richard about wanting
one.[36][37]

[Kim Kardashian](/Kim_Kardashian "wikilink") made news in 2013 for
sporting a $40,000 Birkin, gifted to her by husband [Kanye
West](/Kanye_West "wikilink"), on which the artist [George
Condo](/George_Condo "wikilink") painted a group of nude figures.[38]
Another picture showed [Khloe
Kardashian](/Khloe_Kardashian "wikilink")'s child nestled in $108,000
worth of the bags, which drew some unfavorable comments about
[conspicuous consumption](/conspicuous_consumption "wikilink") from her
adherents.[39] Additionally, Kim's daughter was publicized while
carrying a $17,000 Hermes bag.[40]

American first lady [Melania Trump](/Melania_Trump "wikilink") carried a
Birkin bag during her summer 2018 trip to Scotland.[41]

In *[How I Met Your Mother](/How_I_Met_Your_Mother "wikilink")* [season
6](/How_I_Met_Your_Mother_(season_6) "wikilink"), episode 11 ("The
Mermaid Theory") Zoey is seen sporting a light brown Birkin bag as she
enters the bar to meet and sit with Ted at MacLaren's pub.

Razak](/Najib_Razak "wikilink"), former prime minister of
[Malaysia](/Malaysia "wikilink"), is claimed to have the largest Birkin
collection in the world. Police found a total of 272 Birkins after
seizing the political family's three apartments in Kuala Lumpur.[42]
Following in second and third places are Singapore socialite Jamie Chua,
who reportedly owns more than 200 Hermès Birkin and Kelly bags,[43] and
fashion designer and celebrity [Victoria
Beckham](/Victoria_Beckham "wikilink"), who reportedly has more than 100
Birkin bags.
