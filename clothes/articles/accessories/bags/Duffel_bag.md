A **duffel bag**, **duffle bag**, or **kit bag** is a large bag made of
natural or synthetic [fabric](/fabric "wikilink") (typically canvas),
historically with a top closure using a
[drawstring](/drawstring "wikilink").[1] Generally a duffel bag is used
by non-commissioned personnel in the military, and for travel, sports
and recreation by civilians.[2] When used by
[sailors](/sailor "wikilink") or
[marines](/Marines_(military) "wikilink") a duffel is known as a
"seabag". A duffel's open structure and lack of rigidity makes it
adaptable to carrying sports gear and similar bulky objects.

A duffel bag is often confused with a hoop-handled hard-bottomed
zippered bag, known generically as a **[gym bag](/holdall "wikilink")**.

## History

The name comes from [Duffel](/Duffel "wikilink"),[3] a town in
[Flanders](/Flanders "wikilink"), [Belgium](/Belgium "wikilink"), where
the thick [duffel cloth](/Duffel#Duffel_cloth "wikilink") used to make
the bag originated in the 17th century.[4] According to the Oxford
English Dictionary, the word dates back to 1677, used to describe ‘a
coarse woollen cloth having a thick nap or frieze’.[5] In most of the
20th century, a *duffel bag* typically referred to a specific style of
cylindrical, top-entry bag. During the latter part the term began to be
applied to a generic hoop-handled, hard-bottomed fabric
[holdall](/holdall "wikilink") more commonly known as a "gym bag". It is
to this bag that additional features such as
[wheels](/wheel "wikilink"), zippers, internal structure, and small
organizing pockets are often added.
