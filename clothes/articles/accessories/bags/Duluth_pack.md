[canoe](/canoe "wikilink") travel, particularly in the [Boundary
Waters](/Boundary_Waters "wikilink") region of northern
[Minnesota](/Minnesota "wikilink") and the [Quetico Provincial
Park](/Quetico_Provincial_Park "wikilink") of
[Ontario](/Ontario "wikilink"). A specialized type of
[backpack](/backpack "wikilink"), Duluth packs are made of heavy
[canvas](/canvas "wikilink"), leather, and/or cordura nylon, and are
nearly square in order to fit easily in the bottom of a canoe.

Originally known as the "Poirier pack" or "Poirier pack-sack" (for its
inventor, Camille Poirier), the pack style later became known as the
"Duluth pack", as its primary [manufacturing company of the same

Minnesota](/Duluth,_Minnesota "wikilink").[1][2]

## Description

[right\|thumb\|Canvas and leather pack produced by Duluth Pack. Their #3
has no "set out" and so is
envelope-shaped.](/File:Number3DuluthPackBack.jpeg "wikilink") A Duluth
pack is a specialized type of [backpack](/backpack "wikilink") made of
heavy [canvas](/canvas "wikilink"), leather, and/or cordura nylon. The
packs are a traditional [portage](/portage "wikilink") pack which are
nearly square in order to fit easily in the bottom of a
[canoe](/canoe "wikilink"). The simplest and most traditional Duluth
pack consists of a single large envelope which is closed by
[straps](/strap "wikilink") and roller [buckles](/buckle "wikilink").
The pack is carried by two shoulder straps, and sometimes a
[tumpline](/tumpline "wikilink") worn over the top of the head.

Their key attributes make them well adapted to wilderness canoe camping
where travel is largely by water (where the packs and gear do not need
to be carried) punctuated by portages where the packs and gear need to
be carried over land:

-   They are generally larger than other packs, accommodating a larger
    quantity of gear. Canoe camping typically involves carrying more and
    heavier gear than, for example, backpacking.
-   They must be built strong, carrying heavy loads even when exposure
    to the elements can weaken certain pack materials such as by
    saturation of leather.
-   Their shape accommodates large volumes while remaining compact, and
    their design has few protuberances. This allows better fitting into
    canoes, less snagging during loading and unloading, less "catching"
    of the wind when traveling, and packing lower in canoes to lower the
    center of gravity to enhance canoe stability.
-   They are not tall above the wearer's shoulders (such as backpacking
    packs typically are) allowing the wearer to also carry a canoe.
-   Some have a tumpline which assists weight distribution with heavy
    loads.

Conversely, they lack many features and attributes of long distance
backpacking type backpacks, and so are generally not used for such.

## History

The Duluth pack has its roots in a French-Canadian named Camille
Poirier, who made his way west to Duluth, Minnesota.[3][4] Arriving in
1870 with his "little stock of leather and tools," he began a small shoe
store and quickly made a go of it in this booming frontier town on the
shores of Lake Superior.[5] Out of his small shoe shop on the waterfront
in Duluth, Camille began building a new style [canoe
pack](/canoe_pack "wikilink") with a tumpline, sternum strap, and
umbrella holder. The patented the "C. Poirier Pack Sack" strap design in
1882.[6] In 1911, Poirier sold his business to Duluth Tent & Awning
Company, which later became the company [Duluth
Pack](/Duluth_Pack_(company) "wikilink").
