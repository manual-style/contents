[right\|thumb\|175px\|Woman wearing a fanny
pack](/Image:Red_Fanny_Pack.jpg "wikilink") A **fanny pack** or **belt
bag** or **moon bag** or **belly bag** (American English), **bum bag**
(British English) is a small fabric pouch worn by use of a strap above
the hips around the waist that is secured usually with some sort of
[buckle](/buckle "wikilink"). The straps sometimes have [tri-glide
slides](/tri-glide_slide "wikilink"), making them able to be adjusted to
fit. The American and British names derive from the fact that they are
often worn with the pouch above the buttocks, for which "fanny" and
"bum" are the slang terms in each country respectively, although they
may also be worn with the pouch at the front. The British and Irish
usage of "fanny" is vulgar slang for the labia, so the name "fanny pack"
is rarely used in Australia, Britain, and the Republic of Ireland.

## History

Historically, the bag was positioned in front of the body, so people
could protect themselves from bandits. Bags attached to belts have been
in use since antiquity in many cultures. One origin was the Native
American buffalo pouch which was used instead of sewing pockets into
clothing. Buffalo pouches may also be worn on the wrist or carried on
the front of the chest via a neck [strap](/strap "wikilink") or
[lanyard](/lanyard "wikilink").[1] [Ötzi](/Ötzi "wikilink") had a belt
pouch 5000 years ago. The European medieval belt-pouch is another
antecedent which was superseded as clothing came to have pockets. The
Scottish [sporran](/sporran "wikilink") is a similar belted pouch that
survived because of the impracticality of pockets in a
[kilt](/kilt "wikilink").

The modern version made from synthetic materials came into use in the
1980s and they were especially in vogue in the 1990s, but gradually
their use fell into decline in the 2000s. Their use was satirised by the
American humorist [Weird Al Yankovic](/Weird_Al_Yankovic "wikilink") in
his song *White & Nerdy*.

In 2012, calling them "belted satchels" or "hands-free bags", several
designer labels sought to bring the accessory back by offering stylish
and expensive designs selling for as much as $1995.[2][3]

In 2019, fanny packs are now more popular than ever. Unlike handbags,
they do not have to be carried, and unlike backpacks, they do not put
undue strain on the back. Often referred to as "waist bags", they tend
to be worn cross body rather than around the waist. Fashion houses such
as Chanel and Gucci are at the forefront of the trend. The practicality
of fanny packs is particularly popular in "festival fashion" where
outfits tend to be more extravagant.

[Mobile devices](/Mobile_device "wikilink") (and [USB](/USB "wikilink")
charging cables and backup [batteries](/Electric_battery "wikilink")),
[bottles of water](/water_bottle "wikilink"),
[snacks](/snack "wikilink"), [tissue paper](/tissue_paper "wikilink"),
[first aid](/first_aid "wikilink"), [isopropyl
alcohol](/isopropyl_alcohol "wikilink"), [contact
lenses](/contact_lens "wikilink") and [pepper
spray](/pepper_spray "wikilink") are among some of the most common items
stored in the bag. Fanny packs designed for [concealed
carry](/concealed_carry "wikilink") of a weapon are available.[4]

In other cultures, they are known as banana bags (in France) and kidney
bags (in Spain), while in Italy it is called the *marsupio*, from the
[marsupium](/Pouch_(marsupial) "wikilink"). Variations include the
[wristpack](/wristpack "wikilink"), which is essentially a fanny pack
for the wrist.

## Resurgence

In July 2018, *[The Boston Globe](/The_Boston_Globe "wikilink")*
reported that fanny packs are back in vogue with new packs introduced by
fashion designers [Gucci](/Gucci "wikilink"),
[Prada](/Prada "wikilink"), and [Louis
Vuitton](/Louis_Vuitton "wikilink"). The designer packs retail for up to
$1500 and are being worn by celebrities such as [Kim
Kardashian](/Kim_Kardashian "wikilink"), [Rihanna](/Rihanna "wikilink"),
[Jaden Smith](/Jaden_Smith "wikilink"), and [Russell
Westbrook](/Russell_Westbrook "wikilink"). This time around, the packs
can be worn around the waist or worn cross-body. [*Vogue*
magazine](/Vogue_(magazine) "wikilink") reported on the trend by writing
"Alas, due to our odd fascination with ugly throwback clothing, the
fanny pack has been vindicated."[5]
