**handbag**, commonly known as a **purse** in [North American
English](/North_American_English "wikilink"), is a
[handled](/Handle_(grip) "wikilink") medium-to-large
[bag](/bag "wikilink") used to carry personal items.

## Purse, handbag or pouch

The term "purse" originally referred to a small bag for holding coins.
In many English-speaking countries it is still used to refer to a small
money bag. A "handbag" is a larger accessory that holds objects beyond
currency, such as personal items. American English typically uses the
terms purse and handbag interchangeably. The term handbag began
appearing in the early 1900s. Initially, it was most often used to refer
to men's hand-luggage. Women's bags grew larger and more complex during
this period, and the term was attached to the accessory.[1] "Pocketbook"
is another term for a woman's hand bag that was most commonly used on
the East Coast of the United States in the mid-twentieth century.

## Modern origin

[thumb\|Women's fashion from 1830, including a *reticule* handbag from
France.[2]](/File:Woman's_muslin_dress_and_straw_bonnet_c._1830.jpg "wikilink")
Early modern Europeans wore purses for one sole purpose: to carry coins.
Purses were made of soft fabric or leather and were worn by men as often
as ladies; the Scottish [sporran](/sporran "wikilink") is a survival of
this custom. In the 17th century, young girls were taught embroidery as
a necessary skill for marriage; this also helped them make very
beautiful handbags.[3] By the late 18th century, fashions in Europe were
moving towards a slender shape for these accessories, inspired by the
silhouettes of Ancient Greece and Rome. Women wanted purses that would
not be bulky or untidy in appearance, so *reticules* were designed.
Reticules were made of fine fabrics like silk and velvet, carried with
wrist straps. First becoming popular in France, they crossed over into
Britain, where they became known as "indispensables."[4] Men, however,
did not adopt the trend. They used purses and
[pockets](/pocket "wikilink"), which became popular in men's
trousers.[5]

The modern purse, clutch, pouch or handbag came about in England during
the [Industrial Revolution](/Industrial_Revolution "wikilink"), in part
due to the increase in travel by railway. In 1841 the
[Doncaster](/Doncaster "wikilink") industrialist and confectionery
entrepreneur Samuel Parkinson (of
[butterscotch](/butterscotch "wikilink") fame) ordered a set of
travelling cases and trunks and insisted on a travelling case or bag for
his wife's particulars after noticing that her purse was too small and
made from material that would not withstand the journey. He stipulated
that he wanted various handbags for his wife, varying in size for
different occasions and asked that they be made from the same leather
that was being used for his cases and trunks to distinguish them from
the then-familiar [carpetbag](/carpetbag "wikilink") and other
travellers' cloth bags used by members of the popular classes. [H. J.
Cave](/H.J._Cave_&_Sons "wikilink") (London) obliged and produced the
first modern set of luxury handbags, as we would recognize them today,
including a clutch and a tote (named as 'ladies travelling case'). These
are now on display in the [Museum of Bags and
Purses](/Museum_of_Bags_and_Purses "wikilink") in Amsterdam. H. J. Cave
did continue to sell and advertise the handbags, but many critics said
that women did not need them and that bags of such size and heavy
material would 'break the backs of ladies.' H. J. Cave ceased to promote
the bags after 1865, concentrating on trunks instead, although they
continued to make the odd handbag for royalty, celebrities or to
celebrate special occasions, the Queen's 2012 Diamond Jubilee being the
most recent. However, H.J. Cave resumed handbag production in 2010.[6]

## 20th century

During the 1940s, the rationing of textiles for World War II led to the
manufacturing of handbags made in materials like raffia[7] or crocheted
from yarn. Some women crocheted their own small handbags from commercial
patterns during this period.

## Men's bags

[thumb\|A casual messenger bag.](/File:FreitagBag.jpg "wikilink") The
oldest known purse dates back more than 5000 years, and was a pouch worn
by a man, [Ötzi the Iceman](/Ötzi_the_Iceman "wikilink").[8] Men once
carried coin purses. In early Modern Europe, when women's fashions moved
in the direction of using small ornamental purses, which evolved into
handbags, men's fashions were moving in another direction. Men's
trousers replaced men's [breeches](/breeches "wikilink") during the
course of the 18th and 19th centuries, and pockets were incorporated in
the loose, heavy material. This enabled men to continue carrying coins,
and then paper currency, in small leather wallets. Men's pockets were
plentiful in 19th century and 20th century trousers and coats, to carry
possessions, such as pipes, matches and knives, and they were an item
frequently mended by their wives.[9]

Men's purses were revived by designers in the 1970s in Europe.[10] Since
the 1990s, designers have marketed a more diverse range of accessory
bags for men. The names **man bag**, **man-purse** and **murse** have
been used. The designs common in the U.S. are typically variations on
backpacks or messenger bags, and have either a masculine or a more
unisex appearance, although they are often more streamlined than a
backpack and less bulky than a briefcase. These bags are often called
[messenger bags](/messenger_bag "wikilink") or organizer bags. In many
other countries, it is common for men to carry small rectangular
shoulder bags, often made of leather. The leather
[satchel](/satchel "wikilink") is also common. Men's designer bags are
produced by well-known companies such as [Prada](/Prada "wikilink"),
[Louis Vuitton](/Louis_Vuitton "wikilink"),
[Coach](/Coach,_Inc. "wikilink"), and [Bottega
Veneta](/Bottega_Veneta "wikilink") in a variety of shapes and sizes.
The global men's bag and small leather goods trade is a
$4-billion-a-year industry.[11] Sales of men's accessories including
"holdall" bags are increasing in North America.[12]

## Hardware

[thumb\|1860 Woman's handbag with frame and kissing lock
(LACMA).](/File:Woman%27s_Handbag_LACMA_M.85.85.27.jpg "wikilink") A
distinction can also be made between soft-body handbags or frame
handbags, where a metal frame supports the textile or leather of the
bag. Frame bags often use a [kissing lock](/Lock_and_key "wikilink")
closure, with two interlocking metal beads set on the top of the frame.
Kissing locks were popular on handbags during the early- to mid-20th
century, and remain popular with vintage collectors and in "retro"
designs. These locks are still seen on smaller [coin
purses](/coin_purse "wikilink").

## Coinage as a verb

The verb "to handbag"[13] and its humorous usage was inspired in the
1980s by UK prime minister [Margaret
Thatcher](/Margaret_Thatcher "wikilink") having “weaponized” the handbag
in the opinion of British biographer and historian [David
Cannadine](/Sir_David_Cannadine "wikilink").[14] As “her most visible
symbol of her power to command” the bag became an emphatic prop that she
produced at meetings to show she meant business. She would invariably
bring out of the bag a crucial document from which she would quote, her
speech notes often being cut to size to fit inside. Because Thatcher was
Britain’s first female prime minister, former [Daily
Telegraph](/Daily_Telegraph "wikilink") editor [Charles
Moore](/Charles_Moore_(journalist) "wikilink") wrote in his authorised
biography of 2013, “her handbag became the sceptre of her rule”.[15]

The verb's more general meaning of "treating ruthlessly" came to
symbolize Thatcher's whole style of government. Victims of her
handbaggings, from political leaders to journalists, have testified[16]
to what the German chancellor [Helmut Kohl](/Helmut_Kohl "wikilink")
perceived as her “ice-cold pursuit of her interests”. US secretary of
state [James Baker](/James_Baker "wikilink") recalled her standby ploy:
“When negotiations stall, get out the handbag! The solution is always
there.”

[Julian Critchley](/Julian_Critchley "wikilink"), one of her biggest
[Tory](/Tory "wikilink") backbench critics, once said, "Margaret
Thatcher and her handbag is the same as [Winston
Churchill](/Winston_Churchill "wikilink") and his cigar."[17] Thatcher's
bag was almost as newsworthy an item as she was herself and on the day
she died, one of her handbag-makers saw a sharp rise in sales of her
favorite structured design. The original bag Thatcher asserts on a
signed card was the one “used every day in my time at Downing
Street”[18] is archived at [Churchill College,
Cambridge](/Churchill_College,_Cambridge "wikilink"). Made of dark blue
leather “in mock-croc style”, it was a gift from friends on her birthday
in 1984.
