The **hobo bag** is a style of handbag or purse that is typically large
and characterized by a crescent shape, a slouchy posture and a long
strap designed to wear over the shoulder. Hobo bags are made out of
soft, flexible materials and tend to slump, or slouch, when set down.
There are many different sizes and shapes of this popular woman's
fashion accessory.

This style of purse is called a hobo bag because it resembles the shape
of the bindle on a stick that hobos are portrayed as carrying over their
shoulder in drawings and cartoons.
