[thumb\|The Kelly bag](/File:Kelly_Bag.jpg "wikilink") The **Kelly bag**
(formerly known as the **Sac à dépêches**) is a
[leather](/leather "wikilink") [handbag](/handbag "wikilink") designed
by the [Paris](/Paris "wikilink")-based, high-fashion luxury-goods
manufacturer [Hermès](/Hermès "wikilink"). The bag was redesigned
several times before it was popularized by and then named after the
American actress and Monégasque princess [Grace
Kelly](/Grace_Kelly "wikilink"). The bag is now an expensive [status
symbol](/status_symbol "wikilink").

## Design

The Kelly bag is a [trapezium](/Trapezoid "wikilink") closed with two
straps.[1] Four studs on the bottom, itself made of three layers of
leather,[2] enable it to stand on the ground. It is sold in eight sizes,
ranging from to .[3] The padlock, keys and hardware are made of white or
yellow gold.[4] The current model Kelly bag, the Kelly II, comes in two
distinct styles, as did its predecessor, the Kelly I. The *sellier*
style is a rigid construction including a stiffening layer between the
outer leather and inner lining, with the side and bottom stitching
clearly visible; the *retourné* style is a softer construction, wherein
the bag is sewn and then turned inside-out, hiding the exterior side
stitching. The Kelly II, released in 2000 as an update to the original
Kelly, has a double ring at the top handle, designed to attach to a
shoulder strap; the originally Kelly, while often sold with a shoulder
strap, features a single-ring design. The construction of each Kelly bag
requires 18 to 25 hours of [handicraft](/handicraft "wikilink"), with
each item being created by a single artisan, resulting in high retail
prices.[5][6][7] By the mid-1990s, a Kelly bag was priced at ,[8][9][10]
and as of 2016, prices range from to , with exotic leathers priced
higher.[11]

## History

In 1923, Émile-Maurice Hermès and [Ettore
Bugatti](/Ettore_Bugatti "wikilink") designed a thoroughly simple and
plain bag for Hermès's wife Julie, named after Bugatti. The Bugatti was
the first bag designed by Hermès specifically as a women's handbag and
is notable for being the first handbag to utilize a zipper pull. In the
1930s, Hermès's son-in-law Robert Dumas redesigned it as a spacious
travel bag called Sac à dépêches. It was a sharp contrast to the
dominant purses of the time, which were simple, small and flat,
resembling envelopes.[12]

### Association with Grace Kelly

[thumb\|Red crocodile leather Kelly
bag](/File:Red_Crocodile_Kelly_Bag.jpg "wikilink") [Alfred
Hitchcock](/Alfred_Hitchcock "wikilink") has been credited with bringing
the handbag into the limelight. In 1954, Hitchcock allowed the costume
designer [Edith Head](/Edith_Head "wikilink") to purchase
[Hermès](/Hermès "wikilink") accessories for the film *[To Catch a
Thief](/To_Catch_a_Thief "wikilink")*, starring [Grace
Kelly](/Grace_Kelly "wikilink"). According to Head, Kelly "fell in love"
with the bag. Within months of her 1956 marriage to [Prince Rainier
III](/Rainier_III,_Prince_of_Monaco "wikilink"), the pregnant [Princess
of Monaco](/Princess_of_Monaco "wikilink") was photographed using the
handbag to shield her growing belly from the paparazzi. That photograph
was featured in *[Life](/Life_(magazine) "wikilink")* magazine.[13] A
Hollywood celebrity from a wealthy
[Philadelphia](/Philadelphia "wikilink") family and married to a
European monarch, Princess Grace was a fashion icon, and the handbag
immediately achieved great popularity.[14][15] Although the handbag
instantly became known as the Kelly bag, it was not officially renamed
until 1977.[16]

The handbag with which Princess Grace was photographed was loaned from
the palace archives of Monaco[17] and displayed in the [Victoria and
Albert Museum](/Victoria_and_Albert_Museum "wikilink") in April 2010,
along with other notable wardrobe items owned by the Princess.[18][19]
The "star exhibit" of the show contains scuffs and marks, as the
wardrobe thrifty Princess carried it for many years.[20] Hermès now
creates 32 styles of handbags, but the Kelly persists as the
manufacturer's best-seller.[21]

## In popular culture

The Kelly bag is a [status symbol](/status_symbol "wikilink") and has
appeared in popular culture. In *[Le Divorce](/Le_Divorce "wikilink")*,
the main protagonist's affair with a rich man is revealed by her red
crocodile leather Kelly bag.[22]
