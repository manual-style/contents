A **messenger bag** (also called a **courier bag**) is a type of
[sack](/Bag "wikilink"), usually made of [cloth](/cloth "wikilink")
(natural or synthetic). It is worn over one shoulder with a strap that
goes across the chest resting the bag on the lower back.[1] While
messenger bags are sometimes used by [couriers](/courier "wikilink"),
they are now also an urban fashion [icon](/secular_icon "wikilink").
Some types of messenger bags are called **carryalls**.[2] A smaller
version is often called a **sling bag**.

## History

This design of bag has been used in the transportation of
[mail](/mail "wikilink") and [goods](/good_(economics) "wikilink") by
numerous types of [messengers](/Courier "wikilink"), including [Pony
Express](/Pony_Express "wikilink") riders, postal workers, messengers on
foot (especially in ancient times), and [bicycle](/bicycle "wikilink")
couriers. Some [Royal Mail](/Royal_Mail "wikilink") carriers in the
[United Kingdom](/United_Kingdom "wikilink") currently use large
messenger bags to deliver mail in lieu of a
[postbag](/postbag "wikilink").

Pre-dating today's messenger bags described herein as specifically for
[bicycle messengers](/bicycle_messengers "wikilink"), fashion brands had
been creating "messenger style" bags modeled after military map case
bags and document pouches featuring a shoulder strap intended for wear
across the chest for over a century.

## Use

Similar in function to [backpacks](/backpack "wikilink"), messenger bags
ensure comfort for people carrying heavy and/or bulky items, while
allowing easy access to the contents.

Messenger bags typically incorporate features that make them suitable
for cycling. Such features may include fittings for easy adjustment of
the shoulder strap, quick release buckles, an adjustable hinged buckle,
and the ability to attach accessories, such as lights, phone holsters,
or U-locks. The top-opening one-strap design allows messenger bags to be
easily swung around front so that their contents can be accessed without
removing the bag.

A true messenger bag includes a second, thinner, "stabilizing strap"
that is fastened either around the rider's waist or diagonally across
the chest. Without a stabilizing strap, the bag tends to swing around to
the rider's front, making pedaling difficult.

Messenger bags are often used as a [fashion
accessory](/fashion_accessory "wikilink"). Messenger bags have become
fashionable in urban environments, among [cyclists](/cyclist "wikilink")
and [commuters](/commuter "wikilink"). Many
[college](/college "wikilink") and
[high-school](/high-school "wikilink") students and bicycle commuters
use them for fashionable and functional purposes. Many companies design
messenger bags specifically for the collegiate market. Compared to a
[backpack](/backpack "wikilink"), it is easier to place and remove
text-books, notebooks and supplies from a messenger bag because they can
be easily shifted to the side of the body, providing better
accessibility. Messenger bags provide more weather resistance than
leather [satchel](/Satchel_(bag) "wikilink")-style school bags.

## Construction

Materials used in messenger bags are often more durable and
water-resistant than other over-the-shoulder bags. Contemporary bags use
thicker gauges of [canvas](/canvas "wikilink") and
[tarp](/Tarpaulin "wikilink") shielding for the inner waterproof
[lining](/lining_(sewing) "wikilink"). Other materials include
[ballistic nylon](/ballistic_nylon "wikilink"), vinyl waterproof
[tarp](/tarpaulin "wikilink") lining used to make the bag
[waterproof](/waterproof "wikilink"). The liner provides the support
structure for the bag; this keeps the bag from falling over on itself.
Some companies eschew the standard [PVC](/PVC "wikilink") waterproof
lining for compounds such as [thermoplastic
polyurethanes](/thermoplastic_polyurethanes "wikilink"), which are more
expensive, more durable, more environmentally friendly, and less
volatile.
