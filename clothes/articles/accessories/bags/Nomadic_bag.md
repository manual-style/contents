A **Nomadic bag** is a bag woven by various
[nomadic](/nomadic "wikilink") tribes of the [Middle
East](/Middle_East "wikilink") and [Central
Asia](/Central_Asia "wikilink") for utilitarian and decorative purposes.

The nomadic tribes of the Middle East and Central Asia are perhaps more
known for the hand knotted [carpets](/carpets "wikilink") and hand woven
[kilims](/kilim "wikilink") (flatwoven textiles) that they made. These
tribes include but are not limited to the
[Baloch](/Baloch_people "wikilink"), the
[Turkmen](/Turkmen_people "wikilink"), the
[Afshars](/Afshar_tribe "wikilink"), the
[Bakhtyari](/Bakhtyari "wikilink"), the
[Qashqai](/Qashqai_people "wikilink"), the [Kurds](/Kurds "wikilink")
and many others. The bags that they wove were done in the same
techniques as the larger rugs they also made. The most common technique
is [hand-knotted pile](/Persian_Carpet "wikilink"), but many tribal bags
were also done in the various flat woven techniques including [plain
weave](/plain_weave "wikilink") ([kilim](/kilim "wikilink") weave),
soumac technique and other less common techniques.

These bags were used for various purposes. Often they were used for
transporting goods while on migration. They also served as storage
containers to be used in the tent or [yurt](/yurt "wikilink"). There are
also specialized bags such as bags for carrying mirrors, bags for
carrying the [Qur'an](/Qur'an "wikilink"), bags for carrying tent stakes
and more. Often the bags are known by specific names based on the
function they served. Some common bag names are "cuval"
([camel](/camel "wikilink") bag), "khorjin" (double-sided
[donkey](/donkey "wikilink") bags) and "mafrash" (bedding bag) to name
just a few.

Often, the back panel of a bag will have little or no design. Generally
on bags with knotted pile faces, the back of the bag will be executed in
a plain woven [kilim](/kilim "wikilink") technique.

Although there are still some tribal weavers weaving nice bags, it is
the antique bags and bag faces that are the most prized and the most
collected.

## Bag face

From the [collectors](/collecting "wikilink") point of view, the front
or the *face* of the bag is much more interesting and more collectible.
Often, with antique bags, the backs of the bag have been separated and
discarded at some point and only the bagface remains.
