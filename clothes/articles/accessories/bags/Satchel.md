A **satchel** is a bag, often with a [strap](/strap "wikilink").[1] The
strap is often worn so that it diagonally crosses the body, with the bag
hanging on the opposite hip, rather than hanging directly down from the
shoulder. They are traditionally used for carrying
[books](/books "wikilink").[2] The back of a satchel extends to form a
flap that folds over to cover the top and fastens in the front. Unlike a
[briefcase](/briefcase "wikilink"), a satchel is soft-sided.

The satchel has been a typical accessory of English students for
centuries, as attested in Shakespeare's famous monologue, "[All the
world's a stage](/All_the_world's_a_stage "wikilink")." The traditional
Oxford and Cambridge style satchel features a simple pouch with a front
flap. Variations include designs with a single or double pocket on the
front and sometimes a handle on the top of the bag. The classic school
bag satchel often had two straps, so that it could be worn like a
backpack, with the design having the straps coming in a V from the
centre of the back of the bag, rather than separate straps on each side.
This style is sometimes called a satchel backpack.

In Japan the term for a school bag satchel is
*[randoseru](/randoseru "wikilink")*.

## In fashion

Much of the popularity of the satchel as a fashion accessory in the
United Kingdom, the United States and Canada since 2008 is driven by the
[Cambridge Satchel Company](/Cambridge_Satchel_Company "wikilink"),
whose product was on a *[Guardian](/The_Guardian "wikilink")* gift guide
in 2009, and was described as a cross-body bag in a 2010
article.[3][4][5][6]
