A **wallet** is a small, flat case that can be used to carry such small
personal items as [cash](/cash "wikilink"), [credit
cards](/credit_cards "wikilink"), and identification documents
([driver's license](/driver's_license "wikilink"), [identification
card](/identification_card "wikilink"), [club
card](/club_card "wikilink"), etc.),
[photographs](/photograph "wikilink"), [transit
pass](/transit_pass "wikilink"), [gift cards](/gift_cards "wikilink"),
[business cards](/business_card "wikilink") and other
[paper](/paper "wikilink") or [laminated](/laminate "wikilink") cards.
Wallets are generally made of [leather](/leather "wikilink") or
[fabrics](/textile "wikilink"), and they are usually
[pocket](/pocket "wikilink")-sized but not always
[foldable](/bending "wikilink"). Wallets may have features such as money
clips; chain fastener, strap, or rein; or a zipper. Specialized wallets
are designed for holding passports, wearable ID cards, and checkbooks,
to give some examples. Some unusual wallets are worn on the wrist or
shoe. In addition to their practical function, wallets may be used as a
fashion accessory, or to demonstrate the style, wealth, or status of the
owner.

## Etymology

The word “wallet” has been in use since the late 14th century to refer
to a bag or a [knapsack](/knapsack "wikilink") for carrying articles
(see for example [knapzak](/knapzak "wikilink") in Dutch and Frisian),
indeed its early usage by Shakespeare described something that we would
recognise as more like a backpack today[1]. The word may derive from
[Proto-Germanic](/Proto-Germanic_language "wikilink").[2] The ancient
Greek word *kibisis*, said to describe the sack carried by the god
[Hermes](/Hermes "wikilink") and the sack in which the mythical hero
[Perseus](/Perseus "wikilink") carried the severed head of the monster
[Medusa](/Medusa "wikilink"), has been typically translated as
"wallet".[3][4] Usage of the term "wallet" in its modern meaning of
"flat case for carrying paper currency" in American English dates to
1834 but this meaning was one of many in the 19th century and early 20th
century.[5]

## History

[thumb\|upright\|Aleutian Wallet for carrying
[tackle](Fishing_tackle "wikilink").](/Image:aleutianwallet.gif "wikilink")

### Ancient Greece

The classicist [A. Y. Campbell](/A._Y._Campbell "wikilink") set out to
answer the question, "What...in ancient literature, are the uses of a
wallet?" He deduced, as a Theocritean scholar, that "the wallet was the
poor man's portable larder; or, poverty apart, it was a thing that you
stocked with provisions."[6] He found that sometimes a man may be eating
out of it directly but the most characteristic references allude to its
being "replenished as a store", not in the manner of a [lunch
basket](/lunch_basket "wikilink") but more as a [survival
pack](/survival_pack "wikilink").

### The Renaissance

Wallets were developed after the introduction of [paper
currency](/Banknote "wikilink") to the West in the 1600s. (The first
paper currency was introduced in the New World by the [Massachusetts Bay
Colony](/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony "wikilink") in 1690.) Prior to the
introduction of paper currency, [coin purses](/coin_purse "wikilink")
(usually simple drawstring leather pouches) were used for storing
[coins](/coin "wikilink"). Early wallets were made primarily of cow or
horse leather and included a small pouch for printed [calling
cards](/Visiting_card "wikilink").

In recounting the life of the [Elizabethan](/Elizabethan "wikilink")
merchant, [John Frampton](/John_Frampton "wikilink"), [Lawrence C.
Wroth](/Lawrence_C._Wroth "wikilink") describes the merchant as, "a
young English-man of twenty-five years, decently dressed, ..., wearing a
sword, and carrying fixed to his belt something he called a 'bowgett'
(or budget), that is, a leathern pouch or wallet in which he carried his
cash, his book of accounts, and small articles of daily necessity".[7]

### 19th century

In addition to money or currency, a wallet would also be used for
carrying dried meat, victuals, "treasures", and "things not to be
exposed". Wallets originally were used by early Industrial Americans. It
was considered "semi-civilized" in 19th century America to carry one's
wallet on one's belt. At this time, carrying goods or a wallet in one's
pocket was considered uncivilized and uncommon.[8]

In [Spain](/Spain "wikilink"), a wallet was a case for [smoking
paraphernalia](/Smoking#Substances_and_equipment "wikilink"): "Every man
would carry a small sheaf of white paper in addition to a small leather
wallet which would contain a flint and steel along with a small quantity
of so-called *yesca*, being a dried vegetable fibre which a spark would
instantly ignite."[9]

### Present day

The modern bi-fold wallet with multiple "card slots" became standardized
in the early 1950s with the introduction of the first [credit
cards](/credit_card "wikilink"). Some innovations include the
introduction of the [velcro](/velcro "wikilink")-closure wallet in the
1970s. Pocket-sized wallets remain popular to this day.

For cryptocurrencies that only exist in cyberspace as entries in some
online ledger a "cryptocurrency wallet" is a computing tool whose
purpose is to securely keep the owners secret key, authenticate the
owner, and let the owner sign transactions securely. A "hardware wallet"
is a single purpose computer to do this even more safely.

## Contemporary examples

Wallets are usually designed to hold banknotes and credit cards and fit
into a pocket (or [handbag](/handbag "wikilink")). Small cases for
securing [banknotes](/banknotes "wikilink") which do not have space for
credit cards or identification cards may be classified as [money
clips](/money_clip "wikilink"): this may also be used to describe small
cases designed to hold [ISO/IEC 7810](/ISO/IEC_7810 "wikilink") cards
alone.

## Fashion

Most major designers offer seasonal and perennial wallet collections of
black and brown leather. Major retailers also sell a wide selection of
men's wallets, including branded and house-name wallets.

## Materials

The traditional material for wallets is [leather](/leather "wikilink")
or [fabric](/fabric "wikilink"), but many other flexible flat sheet
materials can be used in their fabrication. Non-woven textiles such as
[Tyvek](/Tyvek "wikilink") are used, sometimes including reuse of
[waterproof maps](/waterproof_paper "wikilink") printed on that
material. [Woven metals](/Wire_mesh "wikilink"), such as fine mesh made
of [copper](/copper "wikilink") or [stainless
steel](/stainless_steel "wikilink") have been incorporated into wallets
that are promoted as having [electromagnetic
shielding](/electromagnetic_shielding "wikilink") properties to protect
against unauthorized scanning of embedded
[NFC](/Near-field_communication "wikilink") & [RFID
tags](/RFID_tag "wikilink").
[Do-it-yourself](/Do-it-yourself "wikilink") websites such as
[Instructables](/Instructables "wikilink") feature many projects for

[Kevlar](/Kevlar "wikilink"), or [duct tape](/duct_tape "wikilink").

## Regional differences

Some wallets, particularly in Europe where larger value coins are
prevalent, contain a coin purse compartment. Some wallets have built-in
clasps or bands to keep them closed. As European banknotes, such as
[euros](/Euro_banknotes "wikilink") and
[pounds](/Banknotes_of_the_pound_sterling "wikilink"), are typically
larger than [American banknotes](/Federal_Reserve_Note "wikilink") in
size, they do not fit in some smaller American wallets.
