**Bug-eye glasses** are a form of eyewear. They were popular in the
1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and were used for regular glasses and
sunglasses. They first became popular in the mid-1970s, and succeeded
the cat eye glasses of the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1970s, they were more
of a square shape, and then later evolved into the more characteristic,
larger, rounder and more familiar bug-eyed style of the 1980s. Their
popularity began to decline later, as glasses became easier to get and
more affordable. They were fashionable for men and women; the sunglasses
form remains fashionable today, while the traditional glasses are now
associated mainly with the elderly. They were followed by the
thick-rimmed, rectangular styled glasses of the 2000s. Notable wearers
are: Audrey Hepburn, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Paris Hilton, Nicole
Richie, Sophia Loren and Victoria Beckham.
