**Cat eye glasses** (sometimes called "cat eyes" or "cat glasses") are a
shape of eyewear. The form is closely related to the browline style,
differentiated by having an upsweep at the outer edges where the temples
or arms join the frame front. They were mainly popular in the 1950s and
1960s among women and are often associated with the Beehive hairstyle
and other looks of the period. They preceded the large bug-eye glasses
of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Notable wearers of cat eye glasses
include: Audrey Hepburn, Barry Humphries as Dame Edna Everage, Jane
Jacobs, Amy Lam√©, Lisa Loeb, Dinah Manoff, Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn
Monroe, Mary Whitehouse, and Barbara Windsor.
