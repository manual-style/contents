**Goggles**, or **safety glasses**, are forms of protective eyewear that
usually enclose or protect the area surrounding the eye in order to
prevent particulates, water or chemicals from striking the eyes. They
are used in chemistry laboratories and in woodworking. They are often
used in snow sports as well, and in swimming. Goggles are often worn
when using power tools such as drills or chainsaws to prevent flying
particles from damaging the eyes. Many types of goggles are available as
prescription goggles for those with vision problems.

Goggles are often worn as a fashion statement in certain subcultures,
most often as part of the cybergoth subculture. They are usually worn
over the eyes or up on the forehead to secure 'falls': a type of long,
often brightly coloured, synthetic hairpiece. Fans of the steampunk
genre or subculture also frequently wear steampunk-styled goggles,
particularly when performing in a live action role-playing game.

Goggles are also frequently used by anime and manga characters as a
fashion statement. For example, it is an idiosyncrasy of team leader
characters in the *Digimon* anime to wear goggles. Other notable
characters who wear goggles are the young Naruto Uzumaki and Konohamaru
from Naruto, Matt from *Death Note* and Usopp from *One Piece*.
