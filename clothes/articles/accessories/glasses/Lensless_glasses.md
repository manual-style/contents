**Lensless glasses** are glasses that lack lenses. They are worn solely
for aesthetic or fashion purposes, having no function in vision
correction or eye protection. The frames are usually oversized, and
commonly all black in color. They may be worn in conjunction with
contact lenses. Advantages of lensless glasses are that they do not fog
or reflect, and there is no lens that will touch long eyelashes and
eyelash extensions.

Lensless glasses first became popular in Japan in the 1990s. The trend
died out, but has resurged recently in China and Taiwan.

Maison Martin Margiela released gold frames that are lensless and
half-rimless.

## In Sports

Many NBA players wear lensless glasses with thick plastic frames like
horn-rimmed glasses during post-game interviews, geek chic that draws
comparisons to Steve Urkel. Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City
Thunder, known for his red frames claimed to have started the trend when
he entered the league in 2008 but LeBron James of the Miami Heat
disagreed. James' teammate Dwyane Wade calls them "nerd glasses." After
the Heat won Game 4 of the 2012 NBA Finals Wade took it a step farther
by wearing flip-up sunglasses. Wade said he was, "paying a little homage
to Dwyane Wayne tonight", referencing Kadeem Hardison's popular
character from *A Different World*.
