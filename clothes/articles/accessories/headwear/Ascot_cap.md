The **Ascot cap**, also known as the **Cuffley cap** or **Lippincott
cap**, is a men's hard [cap](cap "wikilink") similar to the [flat
cap](flat_cap "wikilink"), but distinguished by its hardness and rounded
shape. Ascot caps are typically made from [felt](felt "wikilink") or
wool and worn in the fall or [winter](winter "wikilink"), but
[straw](straw "wikilink") Ascots also exist for warmer weather.

An Ascot being of a single color mostly matches up with casual clothes
of that color or those who match it with a suit match up the color with
the suit setup. Unlike the flat cap, the inside is not lined with silk
but the closed in design and softness of felt still provides comfort and
warmth. The style dates back to 1900.

The Ascot style usually is felt. However, leather, cord, tweed and even
Irish Patchwork styles are also available.
