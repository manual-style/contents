A **baseball cap** is a type of soft [cap](cap "wikilink") with a
rounded crown and a stiff bill projecting in front.

The front of the cap typically displays a design or a
[logo](logo "wikilink") (historically, usually only a sports team,
namely a [baseball](baseball "wikilink") team, or names of relevant
companies, when used as a commercial marketing technique). The cap may
be "fitted" to the wearer's head or the back may have
[elastic](Stretch_fabric "wikilink"), a [plastic](plastic "wikilink")
prong-in-a-hole (multiple holes with one prong that can be inserted),
[Velcro](Hook_and_loop_fastener "wikilink"), a
[zipper](zipper "wikilink"), or a [tri-glide
slide](tri-glide_slide "wikilink") so that it can be quickly adjusted to
fit different wearers' heads. The baseball cap is a part of the
traditional [baseball uniform](baseball_uniform "wikilink") worn by
players, with the brim pointing forward to shield the eyes from the sun.
Since the 1980s, varieties of the hat have become prevalent in the
[United States](United_States "wikilink"), both for utilitarian
(protecting the eyes from the sun) and fashion accessory purposes.

## History

In 1860, the [Brooklyn Excelsiors](Brooklyn_Excelsiors "wikilink") wore
the ancestor of the modern rounded-top baseball cap, which featured a
long peak and a button on top, and by 1900, the "Brooklyn style" cap
became popular. During the 1940s, latex rubber became the stiffening
material inside the hat and the modern baseball cap was born. The peak,
also known in certain areas as the "bill" or "brim", was designed to
protect a player's eyes from the sun. Typically, the peak was much
shorter in the earlier days of the baseball hat. Also, the hat has
become more structured, versus the overall "floppy" cap of the 19th and
early 20th centuries. The baseball cap was and still is an important
means by which to identify a team. Often the logo,
[mascot](mascot "wikilink"), or team's initial was placed on the cap.
Usually, the cap was also fashioned in the official colors of a
particular team.

The basic shape, including curved peak, is similar to some styles of
19th century sun bonnets.

## Design

Fitted baseball caps — those without an adjuster — are normally sewn in
six sections, and may be topped with a matching fabric-covered
[button](button_(clothing) "wikilink") (also called a squatchee) on the
crown. Metal grommets or fabric eyelets are often sewn or attached near
the top of each of the six sections of fabric to provide ventilation. In
some cases, the rear sections of the crown are made of net-like mesh
material for extra ventilation. The peak is typically stiffened by a
sewn-in piece of [paperboard](paperboard "wikilink") or stiff plastic.

### Variations

Baseball caps are made of many types of material and shaped in various
styles for different purposes. Major and minor league baseball players
wear classic-style caps made of [wool](wool "wikilink") (or, more
recently, [polyester](polyester "wikilink")) with their team's simple
logo and colors; the logo is usually
[embroidered](Embroidery "wikilink") into the fabric. More recently
there are brands that are using uncommon materials for snapback hats as
for example wood brims.

Formerly, baseball caps only came in standard hat sizes. Since the early
1970s, they have also been available in a one-size-fits-all form, with
an adjustment strap in the back. The style, commonly called snapback,
has become increasingly popular as fashion accessories. Advances in
textiles have led to the "stretch-fit" hat, which uses Lycra or rubber
to allow a hat to have a fitted style while still being "adjustable"
within sizes.

The front may be soft, or may be stiffened by
[buckram](buckram "wikilink") to display a logo more clearly.

Another version of the baseball cap is a plastic mesh cap with a foam
front imprinted with a company logo. This style is sometimes called a
[trucker cap](Trucker_hat "wikilink") or a "gimme cap" because it is
given away for free as a promotional item.

Dad hats are unstructured caps with low profile, curved brim, and stripe
on the back.

There are 4 major types of baseball caps:

1.  Snapback hat - (hat with a snap closure in the rear) with flat brim,
    high profile, adjustable.
2.  Adjustable hat - (hat with a velcro closure in the rear)
    unstructured, low profile, curved brim, adjustable.
3.  Fitted hat - curved or flat brim, structured cap, high profile,
    unadjustable.
4.  "Flexfit" hat - curved or flat brim, structured cap, high profile,
    adjustable by the use of elastic materials.

## Athletic use

Beginning with the 2014 season, [MLB](MLB "wikilink") pitchers are
permitted to wear a special reinforced cap to protect their heads from
line drives.

Athletes in other sports wear caps with their team's logo and colors as
"sideline" caps; both types are also sold as authentic team merchandise
in retail stores. Other caps may simply have a maker's logo, such as
[Reebok](Reebok "wikilink"), [Nike](Nike,_Inc. "wikilink") or
[Carhartt](Carhartt "wikilink"); these hats are often made of brushed
[cotton](cotton "wikilink"). Golfers tend to prefer the [sports
visor](sports_visor "wikilink") form which does not cover the head but
keeps the sun out of their eyes; women also traditionally have worn
visors casually but a trend in certain youth subcultures sees an
increase in feminine use of full caps.

## Professional use

### Military

Some armed forces use baseball caps as part of their uniforms, including
the [United States Navy](United_States_Navy "wikilink") and [United
States Coast Guard](United_States_Coast_Guard "wikilink"). Used mostly
with the utility uniform and coveralls, the baseball cap usually has a
command logo on the front to denote command affiliation. Baseball caps
of a particular color are worn to denote a specific function of a person
or particular job. For example, in the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") [submarine](submarine "wikilink")
force, red baseball caps are worn by drill monitors who facilitate and
critique members of the boat's crew during drills. In the [United States
Army](United_States_Army "wikilink"), [parachute
riggers](parachute_rigger "wikilink") wear red baseball caps and
parachute instructors wear black baseball caps as part of their uniform.
In various squadrons of the [United States Air
Force](United_States_Air_Force "wikilink")'s [civilian
auxiliary](Civil_Air_Patrol "wikilink"), squadron-distinctive baseball
caps have been issued as headgear (or "cover") for the [Battle Dress
Uniform](Battle_Dress_Uniform "wikilink"), typically displaying squadron
colors, squadron number, and/or squadron patch. Although the BDUs have
their own cover, a [patrol cap](patrol_cap "wikilink") in [M81
Woodland](M81_Woodland "wikilink"), some squadrons have opted for more
distinctive covers.

### Police

In many United States police forces, the baseball cap is worn as a more
practical alternative to the traditional [peaked
cap](peaked_cap "wikilink") or [campaign hat](campaign_hat "wikilink"),
the latter of which is generally used by
[Sheriff's](Sheriffs_in_the_United_States "wikilink") departments and
[state police](State_police_(United_States) "wikilink") forces. This is
more common on the [West
Coast](West_Coast_of_the_United_States "wikilink"), whereas in eastern
states the traditional peaked cap is more prominent. A notable exception
is the [San Francisco Police
Department](San_Francisco_Police_Department "wikilink"), where peaked
caps are still worn regularly. [Turkish
police](Turkish_police "wikilink") switched from peaked caps to baseball
caps in the 1990s. In [Slovenia](Slovenia "wikilink"), policemen on
motorcycles wear baseball caps as a part of their uniform, when they
remove the helmet. The baseball cap is also commonly used by private
security companies as a cheap, practical piece of uniform headgear.

There has been a marked trend in recent years among police forces and
other uniformed bodies throughout the world to substitute cheap and
comfortable baseball caps for peaked caps and other traditional
headdresses. In Britain the baseball cap has the additional advantage of
being unisex and suitable for wear by both male and female officers.
During 2017 the Northamptonshire, Cheshire and Lancashire police forces
adopted specially strengthened baseball caps known as "Bump Caps", to
replace the helmets and bowler hats previously worn. However the
Northamptonshire force announced in November 2018 that their "Bump Caps"
had proven scruffy and unpopular, and would be withdrawn from use.

The [Finnish Police](Police_of_Finland "wikilink") uses a baseball cap
([*seen on the image at this
link*](http://www.poliisi.fi/finnish_police/police_uniforms)), which is
considered an official identification device and cannot be worn or even
displayed by civilians, and has mostly replaced the traditional [side
cap](side_cap "wikilink"). Many armed police units around the world,
notably [SWAT](SWAT "wikilink") in the United States and [Metropolitan
Police](Metropolitan_Police "wikilink")'s [Specialist Firearms
Command](Specialist_Firearms_Command "wikilink") in the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink"), often wear baseball caps to shield
their eyes from the sun where a full helmet would be excessive.
