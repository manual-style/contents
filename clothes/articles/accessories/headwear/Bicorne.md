The **bicorne** or **bicorn** (two-cornered/horned or twihorn) is a
historical form of hat widely adopted in the 1790s as an item of uniform
by [European](Europe "wikilink") and [American](The_Americas "wikilink")
[military](army "wikilink") and [naval](navy "wikilink")
[officers](Officer_(armed_forces) "wikilink"). It is now most readily
associated with [Napoléon Bonaparte](Napoléon_Bonaparte "wikilink") but
in practice most generals and staff officers of the Napoleonic period
wore bicornes, and it survived as a widely worn full-dress headdress
until at least 1914.

## Historic use

Descended from the [tricorne](tricorne "wikilink"), the black-coloured
bicorne originally had a rather broad brim, with the front and the rear
halves turned up and pinned together forming a semi-circular fan shape;
there was usually a [cockade](cockade "wikilink") in the [national
colours](national_colours "wikilink") at the front. Later, the hat
became more triangular in shape, its two ends became more pointed, and
it was worn with the cockade at the right side. This kind of bicorne
eventually became known in the English language as the *cocked hat*,
although to this day it is still known in the French language as the
*bicorne*.

Worn in the side-to-side [athwart](athwart "wikilink") style during the
1790s, the bicorne was normally seen
[fore-and-aft](fore-and-aft "wikilink") in most armies and navies from
about 1800 on. This change in style coincided with the flattening out of
the pronounced front peak of the original headdress. The [French
gendarmerie](French_gendarmerie "wikilink") continued to wear their
bicornes in the classic side-to-side fashion until about 1904 as do the
Italian [Carabinieri](Carabinieri "wikilink") in their modern full
dress.

Some forms of bicorne were designed to be folded flat, so that they
could be conveniently tucked under the arm when not being worn. A
bicorne of this style is also known as a
*[chapeau-bras](chapeau-bras "wikilink")* or *chapeau-de-bras*.

The bicorne was widely worn until [World War I](World_War_I "wikilink")
as part of the full dress of officers of most of the world's navies. It
survived to a more limited extent between the wars for wear by senior
officers in the British, French, US, Japanese and other navies until
World War II but has now almost disappeared in this context.

In addition to its military/naval uses, the bicorne was widely worn
during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by civilian
officials in European monarchies and Japan, when required to wear
uniforms on formal occasions. This practice generally ceased after World
War I except in the context of [diplomatic
uniform](diplomatic_uniform "wikilink"). However British colonial
governors in temperate climates and governors general in some countries
of the [Commonwealth](Commonwealth_of_Nations "wikilink") (notably
Australia, Canada and New Zealand) continued to wear bicornes with
ceremonial dress until the second half of the twentieth century.

## Cocked hat

By the twentieth century, the term *cocked hat* had come to be used more
often than not in official UK usage (uniform regulations etc.) with
reference to this shape of hat (particularly when worn as part of a
uniform); however, in the rare instances where hats were directed to be
worn side-to-side ('athwarts') rather than front-to-back—e.g. by footmen
in full state livery—the term *bicorn* tended to be preferred.

In its most commonly seen form at this time, the cocked hat was pinned
up at two sides to form a hump-back bridge shape and was worn
perpendicular to the shoulders, with the front end above the face and
the back end over the nape. A [cockade](cockade "wikilink") in the
national colours might be worn at the right side (French tradition) and
a plume might be attached to the top (British military c. 1800). Cocked
hats were often trimmed with gold or silver bullion lace and tassels.
Naval officers wore them without further decorations, but those worn by
military and civilian officials might be lavishly decorated with
coloured ostrich or swan feathers.

## Current use

Members of the [Académie française](Académie_française "wikilink") wear
the *habit vert* (green habit) at the Académie's ceremonies. The habit
includes a black jacket and a *bicorne* in the cocked-hat style, each
embroidered in green.

Students at the [École Polytechnique](École_Polytechnique "wikilink")
wear a bicorne as part of their *Grand Uniforme* (GU). Female students
used to wear a [tricorne hat](tricorne "wikilink") but now also wear a
bicorne. The bicorne also formed part of the historic black and red full
dress of cadets at the French Military Medical School ("École de Sante
des Armées") until this uniform was withdrawn in 1971, except for
limited use on special occasions. The bicorne is still worn by the
members of the [Cadre Noir](Cadre_Noir "wikilink") in full dress
uniform.

The uniform of the horsemen of the [Spanish Riding School of
Vienna](Spanish_Riding_School_of_Vienna "wikilink") includes a bicorne.

[Diplomatic uniforms](Diplomatic_uniform "wikilink") worn on such
occasions as the presentation of credentials by
[ambassadors](ambassador "wikilink") normally included bicornes worn
with feathers and gold or silver braiding. Until [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink") such uniforms were worn by even junior
embassy staff but now survive only for ambassadors in a few
long-established [diplomatic services](diplomatic_service "wikilink")
such as those of Britain, France, Sweden, Belgium and Spain.

In the United Kingdom cocked hats continue to be worn by certain
office-holders on special occasions:

-   On occasions in Parliament when the Queen is represented by [Lords
    Commissioners](Lords_Commissioners "wikilink") (e.g. at
    [Prorogation](legislative_session#Procedure_in_Commonwealth_realms "wikilink"))
    the Lords Commissioners wear plain black bicorne hats with their
    parliamentary robes (except the [Lord
    Chancellor](Lord_Chancellor "wikilink") who, if present, wears his
    [tricorne](tricorne "wikilink")).
-   At the annual [Trooping the Colour](Trooping_the_Colour "wikilink")
    in London, the [Major-General commanding the Household
    Division](Major-General_commanding_the_Household_Division "wikilink")
    wears [full dress](British_Army_uniform#Full_dress "wikilink")
    uniform (as does his chief of staff) consisting of a scarlet tunic
    and a cocked hat with swan-feather plume. Similar hats with
    distinctive upright plumes are worn by the
    [Equerries](Equerry "wikilink") on this and other State occasions.
-   Senior officers holding certain royal or special appointments also
    wear cocked hats (e.g. officers of the [Royal Hospital
    Chelsea](Royal_Hospital_Chelsea "wikilink"), officers of the [Yeomen
    of the Guard](Yeomen_of_the_Guard "wikilink"), etc.).
-   In most British regiments prior to 1914, certain Regimental Staff
    officers in full-dress uniform wore cocked hats in place of the
    usual regimental headdress. Since then, the use of full dress has
    been largely restricted to the [Household
    Division](Household_Division "wikilink"), which maintains the
    tradition: [quartermasters](Quartermaster#British_Army "wikilink")
    wear cocked hats with a feather of regimental colour, whilst
    Veterinary Officers and Medical Officers wear cocked hats with a red
    feather plume and black feather plume respectively.
-   Commissioners of the [Metropolitan Police
    Service](Metropolitan_Police_Service "wikilink") and [City of London
    Police](City_of_London_Police "wikilink") in full dress uniform.
-   [Governors of United Kingdom overseas
    territories](Governor#United_Kingdom_overseas_territories "wikilink")
    may wear a cocked hat with white swan-feather plume, or in tropical
    territories, a plumed [pith helmet](pith_helmet "wikilink"). Usage
    has declined since a 2001 decision by [HM
    Treasury](HM_Treasury "wikilink") that the overseas territorial
    government concerned would be responsible for meeting the cost of
    their governor's optional ceremonial uniforms.
-   A cocked hat is still sometimes seen as part of [Court uniform and
    dress in the United
    Kingdom](Court_uniform_and_dress_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink").

In the [Knights of Columbus](Knights_of_Columbus "wikilink"), Fourth
Degree Knights of the Color Corps may wear regalia which includes a
chivalric chapeau. The color of the plume denotes the office held by the
wearer.

The Italian [Carabinieri](Carabinieri "wikilink") wear a bicorn with
points sideways with their full dress uniform. The large tricolor
cockade in front has given it the popular name of la "lucerna", the
"lamp".

In [Java](Java "wikilink"), a cocked hat is still in use in the parade
uniform of the Dhaeng and Ketanggung brigades; both are from [Yogyakarta
Sultanate](Yogyakarta_Sultanate "wikilink"). Since the end of the [Java
War](Java_War "wikilink"), they no longer function as combat troops.
This cocked hat is known in Javanese as hat, because of its shape like a
pointed nose, . Only used on special occasions, such as Grebeg and other
cultural or ceremonial events held by the
[kraton](kraton_(Indonesia) "wikilink") (palace), the headgear came as a
part of Western influence in Yogyakarta, during the reign of
[Sultan](Sultan "wikilink") [Hamengkubuwono
IV](Hamengkubuwono_IV "wikilink").
