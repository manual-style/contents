__NOTOC__

A **boater** (also **straw boater**, **basher**, **skimmer**, **The
English Panama**, **cady**, **katie**, **canotier**, **somer**, **sennit
hat**, or in Japan, **can-can hat**, **suruken**) is a
[semi-formal](semi-formal "wikilink") summer [hat](hat "wikilink") for
men, which was popularised in the late 19th century and early 20th
century.

It is normally made of stiff [sennit](sennit "wikilink") straw and has a
stiff flat crown and brim, typically with a solid or striped
[grosgrain](grosgrain "wikilink") [ribbon](ribbon "wikilink") around the
crown. Boaters were popular as summer headgear, especially for boating
or sailing, hence the name. They were supposedly worn by
[FBI](FBI "wikilink") agents as a sort of unofficial uniform in the
pre-[World War II](World_War_II "wikilink") years. It was also worn by
women, often with [hatpins](hatpin "wikilink") to keep it in place.
Nowadays they are rarely seen except at sailing or rowing events,
period-related theatrical and musical performances (e.g. [barbershop
music](barbershop_music "wikilink")) or as part of old-fashioned [school
uniforms](school_uniforms "wikilink"). Since 1952, the straw boater hat
has been part of the uniform of the [Princeton University
Band](Princeton_University_Band "wikilink"), notably featured on the
cover of *[Sports Illustrated
Magazine](Sports_Illustrated_Magazine "wikilink")* in October 1955.
Recently, soft, thin straw hats with the approximate shape of a boater
have been in fashion among women.

The boater is a semi-formal hat, equivalent in formality to the
[Homburg](Homburg_(hat) "wikilink") and the
[bowler](bowler_hat "wikilink"). As such, it is correctly worn either in
its original setting with a [blazer](blazer "wikilink"), or in the same
situations as a Homburg, such as a smart lounge suit, or with black tie.
[John Jacob Astor IV](John_Jacob_Astor_IV "wikilink") was known for
wearing such hats. Actors [Harold Lloyd](Harold_Lloyd "wikilink") and
[Maurice Chevalier](Maurice_Chevalier "wikilink") and the Italian
engineer [Stefano Zacchè](Stefano_Zacchè "wikilink") were also famous
for their trademark boater hats.

Inexpensive foam or plastic boaters are sometimes seen at political
rallies in the [United States](United_States "wikilink").

In the [United Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink"),
[Australia](Australia "wikilink"), [New Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink")
and [South Africa](South_Africa "wikilink") the boater is still a common
part of the school uniform in many boys' schools, such as at [Harrow
School](Harrow_School "wikilink"), [Shore
School](Shore_School "wikilink"), [Brisbane Boys'
College](Brisbane_Boys'_College "wikilink"), [Knox Grammar
School](Knox_Grammar_School "wikilink"), [Maritzburg
College](Maritzburg_College "wikilink"), [South African College
School](South_African_College_School "wikilink"), [St John's College
(Johannesburg, South
Africa)](St_John's_College_(Johannesburg,_South_Africa) "wikilink"),
[Wynberg Boys' High School](Wynberg_Boys'_High_School "wikilink"),
[Parktown Boys' High School](Parktown_Boys'_High_School "wikilink") and
numerous [Christian Brothers
schools](List_of_Christian_Brothers_schools "wikilink") (CCB).

The boater may also be seen worn by the "carreiros" of
[Madeira](Madeira "wikilink"), the drivers of the traditional wicker
[toboggans](toboggan "wikilink") carrying visitors from the parish
church at [Monte (Funchal)](Monte_(Funchal) "wikilink") down towards
[Funchal](Funchal "wikilink") centre.

[Coco Chanel](Coco_Chanel "wikilink") was fond of wearing boaters and
made them fashionable among women during the early 20th century.

Boater hats of the late 19th century [fin de
siècle](fin_de_siècle "wikilink") until [World War
I](World_War_I "wikilink") usually had wider brims than those
afterwards.

## Straw Hat Day

Being made of straw, the boater was and is generally regarded as a
warm-weather hat. In the days when all men wore hats when out of doors,
"Straw Hat Day", the day when men switched from wearing their winter
hats to their summer hats, was seen as a sign of the beginning of
summer. The exact date of Straw Hat Day might vary slightly from place
to place. For example, in [Philadelphia](Philadelphia "wikilink"), it
was May 15; at the [University of
Pennsylvania](University_of_Pennsylvania "wikilink"), it was the second
Saturday in May. Its cold-weather counterpart was "Felt Hat Day",
occurring in September or October. The practice of wearing formal hats
largely disappeared by the mid-1900s; however, as late as 1963, Straw
and Felt Hat Day were commemorated in an editorial in the *New York
Times*.

In some cities, the convention was forcefully observed by young men who
would seize and destroy any straw hat worn after the appointed day. On a
number of [stock exchange](stock_exchange "wikilink") floors, traders
wore straw hats with the deliberate intention of getting them destroyed.
The term "straw hat day" was used in that era to refer both to the day
of their adoption, at the beginning of summer, and their destruction, at
the end.
