A **bucket hat** (variations of which include the **fisherman's hat**,
**Irish country hat** and **session hat**) is a [hat](hat "wikilink")
with a wide, downward-sloping [brim](Brim_(hat) "wikilink"). Typically,
the hat is made from heavy-duty cotton fabric such as
[denim](denim "wikilink") or [canvas](canvas "wikilink"), or heavy wool
such as [tweed](tweed_(cloth) "wikilink"), sometimes with metal eyelets
placed on the crown of the hat for ventilation.

It was first adopted as a high fashion item in the 1960s, and with
subsequent revivals in both street fashion and on the catwalk. It is
popular [festival](Music_festival "wikilink") gear in the present day,
also known as a "session hat" and is favored by fans of bands such as
[Sticky Fingers](Sticky_Fingers_(band) "wikilink"), [The Stone
Roses](The_Stone_Roses "wikilink"), [King Gizzard & the Lizard
Wizard](King_Gizzard_&_the_Lizard_Wizard "wikilink"),
[Oasis](Oasis_(band) "wikilink") and [Yung Lean](Yung_Lean "wikilink"),

## Origins

The bucket hat or fishing hat is said to have been introduced around
1900. Originally made from wool felt or [tweed
cloth](tweed_cloth "wikilink"), these hats were traditionally worn by
Irish farmers and fishermen as protection from the rain, because the
[lanolin](lanolin "wikilink") from the unwashed (raw) wool made these
hats naturally waterproof. From the [interwar
years](interwar_years "wikilink") onwards, these "Irish walking hats"
were quickly adopted internationally for country pursuits because, when
folded, they could fit inside a coat pocket. If the hat fell in the mud,
it could be easily cleaned with a damp sponge, and it could be reshaped
using steam from a kettle.

The modern bucket hat is derived from a tropical hat made from olive
drab cotton that was issued to the US Army during the [Vietnam
War](Vietnam_War "wikilink"). These lightweight hats became popular
among civilians for use in sports such as fishing, and as sun
protection.

### Fashion accessory

In the 1960s, the bucket hat was adapted as a ladies' fashion item, in
common with the [pillbox](Pillbox_hat "wikilink"),
[bakerboy](Newsboy_cap "wikilink"), and [cloche](Cloche_hat "wikilink")
styles, suiting the fashion for more bouffant hair. Milliners such as
[Lilly Daché](Lilly_Daché "wikilink") created designs in felt or other
stiffer fabrics to capture the "[mod](Mod_(subculture) "wikilink")"
look. The older tweed Irish walking hat remained popular among
professional men until the 1970s, and was notably worn by [Sean
Connery](Sean_Connery "wikilink")'s character in *[Indiana Jones and the
Last Crusade](Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade "wikilink")*.

The hat became popular with rappers in the 1980s and remained part of
street fashion into the 1990s. More recently, it has re-emerged as a
fashion catwalk item after being sported by celebrities such as
[Rihanna](Rihanna "wikilink").
