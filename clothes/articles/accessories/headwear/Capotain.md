A **capotain, capatain** or **copotain** is a tall-crowned,
narrow-brimmed, slightly conical "sugarloaf" hat, usually black, worn by
men and women from the 1590s into the mid-seventeenth century in
[England](England "wikilink") and northwestern
[Europe](Europe "wikilink"). Earlier capotains had rounded crowns;
later, the crown was flat at the top.

The capotain is especially associated with [Puritan](Puritan "wikilink")
costume in England in the years leading up to the [English Civil
War](English_Civil_War "wikilink") and during the years of the
[Commonwealth](Commonwealth_of_England "wikilink"). It is also commonly
called a **Flat Topped Hat** and a **Pilgrim hat**, the latter for its
association with the [Pilgrims](Pilgrim_Fathers "wikilink") who settled
[Plymouth Colony](Plymouth_Colony "wikilink") in the 1620s. Contrary to
popular myth, capotains never included buckles on the front of them;
this image was created in the 19th century.

It has been theorised that the capotain inspired the [top
hat](top_hat "wikilink"). __NOTOC__
