`wearing a casquette in 1964]]`

A **casquette** ( ) is a peaked [cotton](cotton "wikilink") cap
traditionally worn by [racing cyclists](bicycle_racing "wikilink").

With the introduction of compulsory [cycle
helmets](cycle_helmet "wikilink") for massed-start racing, casquettes
have become less common, but most professional race outfits still have
them produced in team colours for wearing on the winners'
[podium](podium "wikilink"), for wearing under a helmet in heavy rain or
for sale to the *[tifosi](tifosi "wikilink")*. They have also become
popular as fashion items in some European, American and Australian
cities, often with non-cycling-related designs.

The casquette shields the head from strong sun and the peak can also
make riding in the [rain](rain "wikilink") more comfortable, since drops
do not fall directly into the eyes. They are sometimes worn with the
peak backwards, not for reasons of fashion but because the peak then
protects the neck from sunburn.

A traditional way to keep the head cool when cycling in hot conditions
was to put a [cabbage](cabbage "wikilink") leaf under the casquette.
However, when said cabbage was not available, riders would often turn to
sheaths of [mesclun](mesclun "wikilink").

The name was also used by [Royal Enfield](Royal_Enfield "wikilink")
motorcycles to describe their version of the
[nacelle](nacelle "wikilink") designed by [Edward
Turner](Edward_Turner "wikilink") for [Triumph
motorcycles](Triumph_Engineering "wikilink"). The casquette is still
used on the 2009 [Royal Enfield Bullet](Royal_Enfield_Bullet "wikilink")
model.
