**Chengziguan** ([Hanzi](Chinese_character "wikilink"): 程子冠) is a
type of *guanmao* (冠帽), a men's traditional hat originated in China,
dates back to the [Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms
period](Five_Dynasties_and_Ten_Kingdoms_period "wikilink"). It's said
that this kind of headgear was usually worn by Chinese [Song
Dynasty](Song_Dynasty "wikilink") philosopher [Cheng
Hao](Cheng_Hao "wikilink") and his brother [Cheng
Yi](Cheng_Yi_(philosopher) "wikilink"), therefore it's called
*Chengziguan*, which literally means “the hat of the Cheng”.
*Chengziguan* is made with [horse hair](horse_hair "wikilink").

Due to the influence from China, it was usually worn by men from the
[yangban](yangban "wikilink"), the upper class of the
[Joseon](Joseon "wikilink") period in Korea (called *jeongjagwan*
(정자관) in [Korean](Korean_language "wikilink")). It was mostly worn at
home as a daily headgear instead of a [gat](Gat_(hat) "wikilink"), a
formal headgear in Joseon dynasty.
