A **Chilote cap** ([Spanish](Spanish_language "wikilink"): *gorro
chilote*) is a woven [cap](cap "wikilink") typical of [Chiloé
Archipelago](Chiloé_Archipelago "wikilink"). The caps are made of coarse
raw wool and usually have a [pom-pon](pom-pon "wikilink") ([Chilote
Spanish](Chilote_Spanish "wikilink") *bellota*,
"[acorn](acorn "wikilink")") at the top. The designs and colours of the
cap may vary but are usually naturally coloured horizontal stripes over
the natural garn.

While the cap is associated with Chiloé, where many Chilote caps sold in
the market are woven, it is popular all over Chile, especially among
field labourers such as [fishermen](fishermen "wikilink"), farmers and
[forestry](forestry "wikilink") workers.
