**Chullo** ( , from ) is an [Andean](Andes "wikilink") style of
[hat](hat "wikilink") with earflaps, made from
[vicuña](vicuña "wikilink"), [alpaca](alpaca "wikilink"),
[llama](llama "wikilink") or [sheep](sheep "wikilink")'s
[wool](wool "wikilink"). Alpaca has wool-like qualities that help to
insulate its wearer from the harsh elements in the [Andean
Mountain](Andes "wikilink") region. Chullos often have ear-flaps that
can be tied under the chin, to further warm the wearer's head.

Hats have been used in the [Andean Mountain](Andes "wikilink") region by
indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Wearing different types and
colors has a significance among certain Andean natives . Acccording to
Peruvian historian Arturo Jiménez Borja, the Chullo has its origins in
the cultural exchange between spaniards, who incorporated elements of
their [birretes](biretta "wikilink") and the original hat of the
andeans.

In the American TV show [South Park](South_Park "wikilink"), the
character [Craig
Tucker](List_of_students_at_South_Park_Elementary#Craig_Tucker "wikilink")
wears a blue chullo.
