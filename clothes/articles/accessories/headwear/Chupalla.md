The **chupalla** ( ) is a traditional Chilean horseman's [hat made of
straw](Straw_hat "wikilink"). Many people in rural areas of [Central
Chile](Zona_Central,_Chile "wikilink") use it as well. In addition, it
is often used when dancing the [cueca](cueca "wikilink") (a Chilean folk
dance) and during [Chilean rodeos](Chilean_rodeo "wikilink").

The name chupalla comes from *achupalla*, a local name given to a
[bromelia](bromelia "wikilink") plant that was used to make these hats.
Today, chupallas are made of various types of straw, including
[rice](rice "wikilink") and [wheat](wheat "wikilink").

The phrase *"por la chupalla"* may be heard frequently in Chile. It is
an [interjection](interjection "wikilink") which, loosely translated,
means "what the heck!".
