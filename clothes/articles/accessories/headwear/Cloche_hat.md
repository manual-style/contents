The **cloche hat** or simply **cloche** ( ) is a fitted,
[bell](bell_(instrument) "wikilink")-shaped [hat](hat "wikilink") for
women that was invented in 1908 by milliner [Caroline
Reboux](Caroline_Reboux "wikilink"). They were especially popular from
about 1922 to 1933. Its name is derived from *cloche*, the French word
for "bell".

During the early twentieth century, the popularity and influence of
cloche hats was at its peak. [Couture](Haute_couture "wikilink") houses
like [Lanvin](Jeanne_Lanvin "wikilink") and
[Molyneux](Edward_Molyneux "wikilink") opened
[ateliers](wikt:atelier "wikilink") to join
[milliners](Hatmaking "wikilink") in manufacturing hats that precisely
matched their clothing designs.

## Design

`in a cloche, 1927]]`

Cloche hats were usually made of [felt](felt "wikilink") so that they
conformed to the head, and were typically designed to be worn low on the
forehead, with the wearer's eyes only slightly below the brim. In later
years, a summer cloche might be made from [sisal](sisal "wikilink") or
[straw](straw_hat "wikilink"). Cloches could also be made of beads or
lace for evening wear, for cocktails, dancing or even for bridal wear.

The contemporaneous [Art Deco](Art_Deco "wikilink") style often
influenced the outline of the brim or the style of seams. While commonly
worn plain, allowing the cut and shape of a well-made hat to take
precedence, a cloche could be decorated with
[appliqués](appliqué "wikilink"), embroidery, jeweled
[brooches](brooch "wikilink"), scarves, fans of feathers, or similar
accents. By the end of the 1920s, it became fashionable to turn the
brims on cloche hats upwards. This style remained prevalent until the
cloche hat went out of fashion around 1933 or '34.

Often, different styles of [ribbons](ribbons "wikilink") affixed to the
hats indicated different messages about the wearer. Several popular
messages included: An arrow-like ribbon which indicated a girl was
single but had already given her heart to someone, a firm
[knot](knot "wikilink") which signaled marriage or a flamboyant
[bow](Bow_(knot) "wikilink") which indicated the wearer was single and
interested in mingling.

## Later fashion

The cloche enjoyed a second vogue in the 1960s.

Cloche hats were also featured in the Fall 2007 collections of many
designers; *[Elle](Elle_(magazine) "wikilink")* magazine called the
cloche hat the "[haute](haute_couture "wikilink") accessory of the
moment" in its September 2007 issue.
