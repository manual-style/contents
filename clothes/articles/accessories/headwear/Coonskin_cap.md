A **coonskin cap** is a [hat](hat "wikilink") fashioned from the skin
and [fur](fur "wikilink") of a [raccoon](raccoon "wikilink"). The
original coonskin cap consisted of the entire skin of the raccoon
including its head and tail. Beginning as traditional Native American
headgear, coonskin caps became associated with American and Canadian
[frontiersmen](frontiersmen "wikilink") of the 18th and 19th centuries,
and were highly popular among boys in the United States, Canada, the
United Kingdom and Australia in the 1950s.

## Origin

Coonskin caps were originally a traditional [Native
American](Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "wikilink") article of
clothing. When Europeans began colonizing the
[Tennessee](Tennessee "wikilink") and [Kentucky](Kentucky "wikilink")
areas, the colonists started wearing them as
[hunting](hunting "wikilink") caps.

The coonskin cap eventually became a part of the [iconic
image](iconic "wikilink") associated with American
[frontiersmen](frontiersmen "wikilink") such as [Daniel
Boone](Daniel_Boone "wikilink") and [Davy
Crockett](Davy_Crockett "wikilink"). Boone did not actually wear
coonskin caps, which he disliked, and instead wore [felt
hats](felt_hats "wikilink"), but [explorer](explorer "wikilink")
[Meriwether Lewis](Meriwether_Lewis "wikilink") wore a coonskin cap
during the [Lewis and Clark
Expedition](Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition "wikilink"). [Joseph L.
Meek](Joseph_L._Meek "wikilink") wore the coonskin cap in the mountains.

An account of actor [Noah Ludlow](Noah_Ludlow "wikilink") introducing
the popular song "[The Hunters of
Kentucky](The_Hunters_of_Kentucky "wikilink")" while wearing a coonskin
cap is shown to be spurious in Ludlow's
[autobiography](autobiography "wikilink"). Ludlow recounted that initial
performance of 1822:

As soon as the comedy of the night was over, I dressed myself in a
[buckskin](Buckskin_(leather) "wikilink") hunting-shirt and leggins,
which I borrowed off a river man, and with
[moccasins](moccasin_(footwear) "wikilink") on my feet and an old
slouched hat on my head, and a [rifle](rifle "wikilink") on my shoulder,
I presented myself before the audience."

## 20th century popularity

### Estes Kefauver

Politician [Estes Kefauver](Estes_Kefauver "wikilink") of Tennessee
adopted the coonskin cap as a personal [trademark](trademark "wikilink")
during his successful 1948 [campaign](political_campaign "wikilink") for
election to the [United States Senate](United_States_Senate "wikilink").
Tennessee [political boss](political_boss "wikilink") [E. H.
Crump](E._H._Crump "wikilink") had published advertisements accusing
Kefauver of being a raccoon-like [Communist](Communist "wikilink")
puppet. In response, Kefauver put on a coonskin cap during a speech in
[Memphis](Memphis,_Tennessee "wikilink"), proclaiming: "I may be a
[pet](pet "wikilink") coon, but I'm not Boss Crump's pet coon." He
continued to use the coonskin cap as a trademark throughout his
political career, which included unsuccessful campaigns for the
[Democratic](Democratic_Party_(United_States) "wikilink") presidential
nomination in 1952 and 1956, an unsuccessful campaign for the [Vice
Presidency](Vice_President_of_the_United_States "wikilink") as [Adlai
Stevenson](Adlai_Stevenson_II "wikilink")'s running mate in 1956, and
successful Senatorial re-election campaigns in 1954 and 1960.

### 1950s fad

In the 20th century, the iconic association was in large part due to
[Disney](The_Walt_Disney_Company "wikilink")'s television program
*[Disneyland](Walt_Disney_anthology_television_series "wikilink")* and
the first three ["Davy
Crockett"](Davy_Crockett_(TV_miniseries) "wikilink") episodes starring
[Fess Parker](Fess_Parker "wikilink"), which aired from December 1954 to
February 1955. In the episodes, which once again made Crockett into one
of the most popular men in the country, the frontier hero was portrayed
wearing a coonskin cap. The show spawned several *Disneyland* Davy
Crockett sequels as well as other similar shows and movies, with many of
them featuring Parker as the lead actor. Parker went on to star in a
*[Daniel Boone](Daniel_Boone_(1964_TV_series) "wikilink")* television
series (1964-1970), again wearing a coonskin cap.

Crockett's new popularity initiated a [fad](fad "wikilink") among boys
all over the United States as well as a [Davy Crockett
craze](The_Ballad_of_Davy_Crockett "wikilink") in the United Kingdom.
The look of the cap that was marketed to young boys was typically
simplified; it was usually a [faux fur](faux_fur "wikilink") lined skull
cap with a raccoon tail attached. A variation was marketed to young
girls as the Polly Crockett hat. It was similar in style to the boys'
cap, including the long tail, but was made of all-white fur (faux or
possibly rabbit). At the peak of the fad, coonskin caps sold at a rate
of 5,000 caps a day. By the end of the 1950s, Crockett's popularity
waned and the fad slowly died out. The fad is recalled by numerous
cultural references, such as the wearing of coonskin caps as part of
[The Junior Woodchucks](The_Junior_Woodchucks "wikilink") uniform in
Disney's [Donald Duck comics](Donald_Duck_comics "wikilink"). Novelist
[Thomas Pynchon](Thomas_Pynchon "wikilink") referenced both the hat and
the fashion in his novel [V.](V. "wikilink"), where he refers to the hat
as a "bushy Freudian [hermaphrodite](hermaphrodite "wikilink") symbol".
