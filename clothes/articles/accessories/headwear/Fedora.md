## History

The term *fedora* was in use as early as 1891. Its popularity soared,
and eventually it eclipsed the similar-looking
[homburg](Homburg_(hat) "wikilink"). The word *fedora* comes from the
title of an 1882 play by dramatist [Victorien
Sardou](Victorien_Sardou "wikilink"), *[Fédora](Fédora "wikilink"),*
which was written for [Sarah Bernhardt](Sarah_Bernhardt "wikilink"). The
play was first performed in the United States in 1889. Bernhardt played
Princess Fédora Romazov, the heroine of the play. During the play,
Bernhardt – a noted [cross-dresser](Cross-dressing "wikilink") – wore a
center-creased, soft brimmed hat. The hat was fashionable for women, and
the women's rights movement adopted it as a symbol. After [Edward,
Prince of Wales](Edward_VIII "wikilink") started wearing them in 1924,
it became popular among men for its stylishness and its ability to
protect the wearer's head from the wind and weather. Since the early
part of the 20th century, many [Haredi](Haredi_Judaism "wikilink") and
other [Orthodox](Orthodox_Judaism "wikilink") [Jews](Jew "wikilink")
have made black fedoras normal to their daily wear.

### Fedoras in early American society

During the early twentieth century, a hat was a staple of men's fashion
and would be worn in almost all public places. However, as a social
custom and common courtesy, men would remove their hats when at home or
when engaged in conversation with women. In addition, the ability to own
a hat was culturally considered a sign of wealth due to fashion being
recognized as a “status symbol.” Only those with few economic resources
would venture the streets without a hat. The introduction of a new line
of felt hats made from nutria, which is an animal similar to the beaver,
helped establish the fedora as a durable product. Prices, in the first
decade of the twentieth century, for a nutria fedora ranged from
ninety-eight cents to two dollars and twenty-five cents. Starting in the
1920s, fedoras began to rise in popularity after the Prince of Wales
adopted the felt hat as his favored headwear. As a result, “the soft
felt hat replaced the stiff hat as the best seller in the decade.” The
fedora soon took its place as a choice hat and joined other popular
styles that included the derby, homburg, and Panama.

In America during the 1940s, the brims of fedoras started to increase in
width, while the British maintained a slightly smaller brim size. The
colors of fedoras traditionally included shades of black, brown, and
gray. However, this palette would grow at the onset of the second world
war to include military themed colors such as khaki, blue, and green.
One of the most prominent companies to sell fedoras was the department
store, Sears, Roebuck and Company. In addition, famous hat manufactures
which still exist today include Bailey, Borsalino, and
[Stetson](Stetson "wikilink").

### Women and fedoras

In the 1880s, French stage actress Sarah Bernhardt popularized the
fedora for the female audience. It soon became a common fashion
accessory for many women, especially among activists fighting for gender
equality during the late nineteenth century. The fedora was eventually
adopted as a defining symbol of the women's rights movement. It would
not be until 1924 when, in Britain, the fashion minded Prince Edward
started wearing the felt hat. This event shifted the popularity of the
fedora over to men's fashion, making the hat one of the few androgynous
clothing pieces.

To this day, fedoras continue to be worn by women, however, not quite to
the same extent as they once were in the early twentieth century.
Women's fedoras vary in form, texture, and color. In addition, these
fedoras come in almost every color from basic black to bright red and
even in the occasional animal print. Along with men's felt hats, women's
fedoras are making a comeback in current fashion trends. Baseball caps,
which have in recent years been the staple of headwear, are currently
experiencing a decline in popularity amidst this “fedora renaissance.”

## Make and form

Fedoras are usually made by pressing a piece of felt over a mold, and
using some kind of heat or sealant to help the felt keep its shape. In
the past, molds were created by using a series of wooden blocks to
create the shape of the hat, and the felt was pressed on with an iron.
The current method is to use metal molds and machinery to create enough
pressure to form the shape of the hat. After the general shape of the
hat has been achieved, the hat makers attach some sort of decoration,
usually a ribbon, between the brim and the crown of the hat. The brim is
either left raw, or hemmed. There are variations from hat to hat, but
the standard design includes a creased crown, angled brim, a pinch at
the top of the hat, and some sort of decoration above the brim of the
hat. Men's fedoras especially tend to have stylized brims with edges
that are turned down in the front and up in the back. As mentioned
earlier, the width of the brim, overall size and color of the hats are
 subject to change with fashion trends. Women's hats also tend to have
more elaborate decorations and slimmer designs.

Because of the soft nature of the hat, many variations are possible with
Fedoras. One variation of the hat includes the Stetson playboy hat which
was popular in the 1940s. The Stetson playboy hat involved a marketing
success story, with a simple variation on the general form of the fedora
becoming a huge hat trend in America. [Al Capone](Al_Capone "wikilink")
was very fond of the playboy style. Many famous pictures of Capone
depict him sporting a Stetson playboy hat.

Contemporary takes on the fedora include asymmetrical brims, bright
colors, eccentric patterns, and flashy decorations.

## How fedoras are worn

Fedoras are worn by both men and women. Fedoras are often considered a
classy accessory, and as such, they are generally worn with a suit, or
professional attire. Because the fedora is so tied into historic fashion
trends, many choose to wear it with other classic clothing such as
oxfords and tailored suits. Others choose to use the fedora to create a
new look. The hipster fad in 2014 embraced the fedora, and the hat once
again became a common accessory associated with the look. Because the
hat has lost its status as a symbol of class standing, many decide to
swap out the warm felt of the fedora for something cooler, like a straw
hat during the summer months. Fedoras are not generally worn indoors, as
they are considered an outdoor accessory.

## In popular culture

Fedoras became widely associated with gangsters and
[Prohibition](Prohibition_in_the_United_States "wikilink"), a connection
coinciding with the height of the hat's popularity between the 1920s and
the early 1950s. In the second half of the 1950s, the fedora fell out of
favor in a shift towards more informal clothing styles.

Coach [Tom Landry](Tom_Landry "wikilink") also wore the hat while he was
the head coach of the [Dallas Cowboys](Dallas_Cowboys "wikilink"). It
would later become his trademark image. A
[cenotaph](cenotaph "wikilink") dedicated to Landry with a depiction of
his fedora was placed in the official [Texas State
Cemetery](Texas_State_Cemetery "wikilink") in
[Austin](Austin,_Texas "wikilink") at the family's request. In addition
the Cowboys wore a patch on their uniforms during the 2000 season
depicting Landry's fedora.

[Bear Bryant](Bear_Bryant "wikilink"), long-time coach at the
[University of Alabama](University_of_Alabama "wikilink") was known for
wearing a black-and-white [houndstooth](houndstooth "wikilink") fedora.

[Indiana Jones](Indiana_Jones "wikilink") re-popularized the fedora in
the [*Indiana Jones* franchise](Indiana_Jones_franchise "wikilink"). The
backstory of how he obtains the hat is told in the prologue of *[Indiana
Jones and the Last
Crusade](Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade "wikilink")*, the third film
of the series, and the character who gives him the hat is credited as
"Fedora". The character [Freddy Krueger](Freddy_Krueger "wikilink"),
from the [*Nightmare on Elm Street*
franchise](A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street "wikilink"), also wears a brown
fedora.

This hat is also worn by the fictional female international thief
[Carmen Sandiego](Carmen_Sandiego "wikilink"). It is mostly seen being
the color red along with the rest of her trench coat.

The fedora hat of the ninth president of Turkey, [Süleyman
Demirel](Süleyman_Demirel "wikilink"), was a famous part of the
president's image.

In the 21st century, the fedora has made a reappearance in the fashion
world along with other types of classic hats such as the porkpie and the
homburg. According to H. Lee Murphy, fedoras are a bold new fashion
statement, but still maintain a certain amount of nostalgia. Murphy
credits celebrities such as Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, and Justin
Timberlake for the new wave of fedoras. In addition, the fedora has
appeared in recent portrayals of movies and television shows, set in the
past, such as *[Mad Men](Mad_Men "wikilink")* (2007–15), *[Shutter
Island](Shutter_Island_(film) "wikilink")* (2010), and *[Boardwalk
Empire](Boardwalk_Empire "wikilink")* (2010–14). [Michael
Jackson](Michael_Jackson "wikilink") also frequently wore a fedora while
performing on stage.

By the early 21st century, the fedora had become a symbol of
[hipsters](hipster_(contemporary_subculture) "wikilink").
*[Vice](Vice_(magazine) "wikilink")* has referred to the early 2000s as
a "fedora [renaissance](renaissance "wikilink")", with celebrities like
[Johnny Depp](Johnny_Depp "wikilink") and [Pete
Doherty](Pete_Doherty "wikilink") wearing the hat, but claimed that by
2016, the fedora may be "the single most-hated fashion accessory money
can buy". This is caused by the association of the fedora (or the
[trilby](trilby "wikilink"), which is often confused with it) with the
"[neckbeard](Neckbeard_(slang) "wikilink")" stereotype. During this
latter period, [James Toback](James_Toback "wikilink") was noted for his
love of fedoras.

### In film noir

The fedora has become a defining characteristic of film noir when
examined from a fashion standpoint. Film noir which is often defined by
its innovative camera techniques, gritty stories, and femme fatales has
also come to include fashion as a part of the genre.

[Billy Wilder](Billy_Wilder "wikilink") wrote and directed the 1978 film
*[Fedora](Fedora_(1978_film) "wikilink")*, which takes its title from
the female lead character played by [Marthe
Keller](Marthe_Keller "wikilink"). In addition, fedoras are a strong
theme throughout the picture. The title also pays homage to the iconic
accessory commonly worn in Noir films from the 1940s and '50s. Billy
Wilder also participated in directing films such as “Sunset Boulevard”
and “Some Like it Hot” in the era of Hollywood's golden age. As a
result, most of Wilder's work features fedoras prominently in
promotional materials as well as in the finished films.

### Gangsters and jazz

Fedoras were an important accessory to the [zoot
suit](zoot_suit "wikilink") ensemble which emerged onto the American
fashion scene during the 1940s. Zoot suits were mainly associated with
Mexican and African Americans and were largely worn in segregated
minority communities. As a result, this style soon spread to local jazz
musicians who adopted this look and brought it to their audiences. In
addition, well-known gangsters such as [Al
Capone](Al_Capone "wikilink"), [Charles
Luciano](Charles_Luciano "wikilink"), and [Benjamin "Bugsy"
Siegel](Bugsy_Siegel "wikilink") used the fedora to create a "tough guy"
image. The association of the fedora with the zoot suit and gangster
culture has caused the general public to view it according to this
limited connotation.
