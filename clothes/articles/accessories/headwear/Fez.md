The **fez** ( ), also called **tarboosh** ( , derived from ), is a felt
headdress in the shape of a short cylindrical peakless hat, usually red,
and sometimes with a tassel attached to the top. The name "fez" refers
to the Moroccan city of [Fez](Fez,_Morocco "wikilink") (capital of the
[Kingdom of Morocco](Kingdom_of_Morocco "wikilink") until 1927), where
the dye to color the hat was extracted from crimson berries. The modern
fez owes much of its popularity to the [Ottoman
era](Ottoman_era "wikilink").

The fez is often confused with the similar looking (or with
[French](French_language "wikilink") spelling , from
[Arabic](Arabic_language "wikilink") *shāshiyya*), which is more popular
in the [Maghreb](Maghreb "wikilink") but originated from Shash, the
former name of [Tashkent](Tashkent "wikilink"), Uzbekistan, where
shashias have been made since the 9th century. The two types of headgear
are a little different: the fez is stiff, cylindrical, and raised in
shape, whereas the shashia is soft and its shape adheres to the top of
the head, in the manner of a cap.

## History

The fez may have originated in [ancient
Greece](ancient_Greece "wikilink"), or the
[Balkans](Balkans "wikilink"), initially during the [Byzantine
reign](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink"), and subsequently, during the
Ottoman period, various peoples, mostly [Bosniaks](Bosniaks "wikilink")
and [Serbs](Serbs "wikilink"), started wearing the head-wear.

The fez is a part of the traditional clothing of
[Cyprus](Cyprus "wikilink"), and is still worn by some Cypriots today.
Traditionally, women wore a red fez over their heads, instead of a
[headscarf](headscarf "wikilink"), while men wore a black or red cap.
The fez was sometimes worn by men with material (similar to a wrapped
[keffiyeh](keffiyeh "wikilink") or [turban](turban "wikilink")) around
the base. In his 1811 journey to Cyprus, John Pinkerton describes the
fez, "a red cap turned up with fur", as "the proper Greek dress". In the
[Karpass Peninsula](Karpass_Peninsula "wikilink"), white caps are worn,
a style considered to be based on ancient Cypriot
Hellenic-[Phoenician](Phoenicia "wikilink") attire, thus preserving
men's head-wear from 2,700 years earlier.

`after his clothing reforms.]]`

In 1826 Sultan [Mahmud II](Mahmud_II "wikilink") of the [Ottoman
Empire](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") [suppressed the
Janissaries](The_Auspicious_Incident "wikilink") and began sweeping
reforms of the military. His [modernized
military](Nizam-ı_Cedid "wikilink") adopted Western style uniforms and,
as headdresses, the fez with a cloth wrapped around it. In 1829 the
Sultan ordered his civil officials to wear the plain fez, and also
banned the wearing of [turbans](turban "wikilink"). The intention was to
coerce the populace at large to update to the fez, and the plan was
successful. This was a radically egalitarian measure, which replaced the
elaborate [sumptuary laws](sumptuary_law "wikilink") that signaled rank,
[religion](millet_(Ottoman_Empire) "wikilink"), and occupation, allowing
prosperous non-Muslims to express their wealth in competitions with
Muslims, foreshadowing the [Tanzimat](Tanzimat "wikilink") reforms.
Although tradesmen and artisans generally rejected the fez, it became a
symbol of modernity throughout the Near East, inspiring similar decrees
in other nations (such as Iran in 1873).

.\]\]

To meet escalating demand, skilled fez makers were induced to immigrate
from North Africa to [Constantinople](Constantinople "wikilink"), where
factories were established in the neighborhood of
[Eyüp](Eyüp "wikilink"). Styles soon multiplied, with nuances of shape,
height, material, and hue competing in the market. The striking scarlet
and merlot colors of the fez were initially achieved through an extract
of [cornel](Cornus_mas "wikilink"). However, the invention of low-cost
synthetic dyes soon shifted production of the hat to the factories of
[Strakonice](Strakonice "wikilink"), [Czech
Republic](Czech_Republic "wikilink") (then in the Austrian Empire).

The 1908 [Austro-Hungarian annexation of
Bosnia-Herzegovina](Austro-Hungarian_annexation_of_Bosnia-Herzegovina "wikilink")
resulted in a [boycott](boycott "wikilink") of Austrian goods, which
became known as the "Fez Boycott" due to the near monopoly the Austrians
then held on production of the hat. Although the headdress survived, the
year-long boycott brought the end of its universality in the Ottoman
Empire as other styles became socially acceptable.

The fez was initially a brimless bonnet of red, white, or black with a
turban woven around. Later the turban was eliminated, the bonnet
shortened, and the color fixed to red. Praying while wearing a
fez—instead of a headdress with brim—was easier because Muslims put
their foreheads on the ground many times during the prayer sessions.

The fez was also the main headdress in the Ottoman Empire for
non-Muslims, especially for [Jews](Jews "wikilink") Jewish men wore the
fez, usually referred to in the community by the Arabic "tarboush,"
especially Syrian and Palestinian Jews .

### Symbolism

Initially a symbol of Ottoman modernity, the fez over time came to be
seen as part of an "[Oriental](Orientalism "wikilink")" cultural
identity. Seen as exotic and romantic in the west, it enjoyed a vogue as
part of men's luxury smoking outfit in the United States and the United
Kingdom in the decades surrounding the turn of the 20th century. The fez
had become traditional to the point that [Mustafa Kemal
Atatürk](Mustafa_Kemal_Atatürk "wikilink") banned it in
[Turkey](Turkey "wikilink") in 1925 as part of [his modernizing
reforms](Atatürk's_Reforms "wikilink").

In South Asia, the fez had been adopted in part due to its links with
the Ottomans. In Morocco it remains as a national symbol, to the extent
that the King and his cabinet ministers wear it on formal occasions. In
other countries the fez remains a part of the national costume (see
below).

## Military use

A version of the fez was used as an [arming cap](arming_cap "wikilink")
for the 1400–1700s version of the mail armour head protector (a round
metal plate or skull-cap, around which hung a curtain of mail to protect
the neck and upper shoulder). The red fez with blue tassel was the
standard headdress of the [Turkish Army](Turkish_Army "wikilink") from
the 1840s until the introduction of a [khaki](khaki "wikilink") service
dress and peakless [sun helmet](sun_helmet "wikilink") in 1910. The only
significant exceptions were cavalry and some artillery units who wore a
[lambskin](sheepskin "wikilink") hat with coloured cloth tops.
[Albanian](Ottoman_Albania "wikilink") levies wore a white version of
the fez, resembling their traditional [qeleshe](qeleshe "wikilink").
During [World War I](World_War_I "wikilink") the fez was still worn by
some naval reserve units and occasionally by soldiers when off duty. The
[Evzones](Evzones "wikilink") (light infantry) regiments of the [Greek
Army](Greek_Army "wikilink") wore their own distinctive version of the
fez from 1837 until [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"). It now
survives in the parade uniform of the Presidential Guard in Athens.

`during the `[`Crimean`` ``War`](Crimean_War "wikilink")` (1853–56).]]`

From the mid-19th century on the fez was widely adopted as the headdress
of locally recruited "native" soldiers among the various [colonial
troops](colonial_troops "wikilink") of the world. The French North
African regiments ([Zouaves](Zouave "wikilink"),
[Tirailleurs](Tirailleurs "wikilink"), and [Spahis](Spahis "wikilink"))
wore wide, red fezzes with detachable tassels of various colours. It was
an off-duty affectation of the Zouaves to wear their fezzes at different
angles according to the regiment; French officers of North African units
during the 1930s often wore the same fez as their men, with rank
insignia attached. (Many volunteer Zouave regiments wore the French
North African version of the fez during the [American Civil
War](American_Civil_War "wikilink").) The Libyan battalions and
squadrons of the Italian colonial forces wore lower, red fezzes over
white skull caps. [Somali](Somali_people "wikilink") and
[Eritrean](Italian_Eritrea "wikilink") regiments in Italian service wore
high red fezzes with coloured tufts that varied according to the unit.
German [askaris](askaris "wikilink") in East Africa wore their fezzes
with khaki covers on nearly all occasions.

The Belgian [Force Publique](Force_Publique "wikilink") in the Congo
wore large and floppy red fezzes similar to those of the French
Tirailleurs Senegalais and the Portuguese Companhias Indigenas. The
British [King's African Rifles](King's_African_Rifles "wikilink")
(recruited in East Africa) wore high straight-sided fezzes in either red
or black, while the [West African Frontier
Force](West_African_Frontier_Force "wikilink") wore a low red version.
The [Egyptian Army](Egyptian_Army "wikilink") wore the classic Turkish
model until 1950. The [West India
Regiment](West_India_Regiment "wikilink") of the British Army wore a fez
as part of its Zouave-style full dress until this unit was disbanded in
1928. The tradition is continued in the full dress of the band of the
[Barbados Regiment](Barbados_Regiment "wikilink"), with a white turban
wrapped around the base.

While the fez was a colourful and picturesque item of uniform it was in
several ways an impractical headdress. If worn without a drab cover it
made the head a target for enemy fire, and it provided little protection
from the sun. As a result, it was increasingly relegated to parade or
off-duty wear by World War II, although France's West African
*tirailleurs* continued to wear a khaki-covered version in the field
until about 1943. During the final period of colonial rule in Africa
(approximately 1945 to 1962) the fez was seen only as a full-dress item
in French, British, Belgian, Spanish and Portuguese African units; being
replaced by wide-brimmed hats or [forage caps](forage_cap "wikilink") on
other occasions. Colonial police forces, however, usually retained the
fez as normal duty wear for indigenous personnel.

Post-independence armies in Africa quickly discarded the fez as a
colonial relic. It is, however, still worn by the ceremonial Gardes
Rouge in Senegal as part of their [Spahi](Spahi "wikilink")-style
uniform, and by the Italian [Bersaglieri](Bersaglieri "wikilink") in
certain orders of dress. The Bersaglieri adopted the fez as an informal
headdress through the influence of the French Zouaves, with whom they
served in the [Crimean War](Crimean_War "wikilink"). The Italian
[Arditi](Arditi "wikilink") in the First World War wore a black fez that
later became a uniform item of the Mussolini
[Fascist](Fascist "wikilink") regime. The Spanish
[Regulares](Regulares "wikilink") (formerly Moorish) Tabors stationed in
the Spanish [exclaves](exclave "wikilink") of [Ceuta](Ceuta "wikilink")
and [Melilla](Melilla "wikilink"), in North Africa, retain a parade
uniform that includes the fez and white cloaks. Filipino units organised
in the early days of U.S. rule briefly wore black fezzes and officers
serving with Muslim personnel of the Philippines Constabulary were
authorized to wear this headdress from 1909. The Liberian Frontier
Force, although not a colonial force, wore fezzes until the 1940s.

[Bosnian infantry](Bosnian-Herzegovinian_Infantry "wikilink") regiments
in the former [Austro-Hungarian](Austro-Hungarian "wikilink") Empire had
been distinguished by wearing the fez until the end of [World War
I](World_War_I "wikilink"). They wore distinctive light blue or field
grey uniforms, with a buckle showing an arm with a scimitar inside a
shield as the symbol of Bosniak ethnicity. The largely
[Bosniak](Bosniak "wikilink") Muslim [13th Waffen Mountain Division of
the SS
Handschar](13th_Waffen_Mountain_Division_of_the_SS_Handschar_(1st_Croatian) "wikilink"),
which was recruited from Bosnia, used a red or field grey fez with
Waffen SS cap insignia during the latter half of [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink").

Two regiments of the Indian Army recruited from Muslim areas wore fezzes
under British rule (although the turban was the nearly-universal
headdress among Hindu and Muslim sepoys and sowars). A green fez was
worn by the Bahawalpur Lancers of Pakistan as late as the 1960s.

## International use

### In the Middle East and North Africa

It is believed that the chechia originated in Uzbekistan. Unlike the
fez, the chechia is shorter, and crafted from less stiff material, and
is therefore softer and more pliable. By the 17th century that the
chaouachis, or chechia makers, had spread to the capital
[Tunis](Tunis "wikilink"), the capital of [Tunisia](Tunisia "wikilink").
By the 21st century, the procedure for making them remains the same, but
the number of craftsmen who make them has decreased. While the market
place in the [Souk Ech-Chaouachine](Souk_Ech-Chaouachine "wikilink"),
hosted about 30,000 chaouachis during at its peak, that number had
dropped by the 2010s to about 20, who struggle to keep the business
alive. The modern chechia business is estimated to create jobs for over
2,000 artisans, with the remaining chechias are sold overseas, primarily
to Libya, Nigeria and Niger. Chechia colours vary by country. It is red
in Tunisia, and lacks a tassel. In Libya, the chechia is normally black,
except the Benghazi version, or "chenna", which is also red, and
includes a tassel. In Morocco, and in some parts of Tunisia, it can also
be seen in white or grey.

### In Southern Asia

, Indian politician and Deputy Chief Minister of
[Telangana](Telangana "wikilink") state wearing fez\|thumb\]\] The fez
is known as the *Rumi Topi*, which means "Headdress of Rome" (By virtue
of the [Ottoman Empire](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") being seen as the
[successor state](Third_Rome "wikilink") of the [Eastern Roman
Empire](Eastern_Roman_Empire "wikilink")). It is worn by some sections
of the Muslim aristocracy of [South Asia](South_Asia "wikilink"). It was
also a symbol of the support for the [Ottoman
Caliphate](Ottoman_Caliphate "wikilink") against the [British Indian
Empire](British_Indian_Empire "wikilink") during the [Khilafat
Movement](Khilafat_Movement "wikilink"). Later, it became associated
with some leaders of the [Muslim
League](All-India_Muslim_League "wikilink"), the political party that
eventually created the country of [Pakistan](Pakistan "wikilink"). The
veteran Pakistani politician [Nawabzada Nasrullah
Khan](Nawabzada_Nasrullah_Khan "wikilink") was one of the few people in
Pakistan who wore the fez, until his death in 2003.

In [Sri Lanka](Sri_Lanka "wikilink"), the fez was frequently by the
local Muslim [Sri Lankan Moor](Sri_Lankan_Moor "wikilink") population.
Despite its use declining in popularity, the fez is still used in
traditional marriage ceremonies. It continues to be worn by
"Qadiriyathun Nabaviyyah" Sufi path followers

A variation of the fez has been commonly worn in [Maritime Southeast
Asia](Maritime_Southeast_Asia "wikilink") since the 19th century when it
was introduced by Muslims from [South Asia](South_Asia "wikilink").
Known as a [peci](peci "wikilink") in
[Indonesian](Indonesian_language "wikilink") and
[songkok](songkok "wikilink") in
[Malaysian](Malaysian_language "wikilink"), this variant is black in
colour with a more ellipse shape and sometimes decorated with
embroidery. The Philippine varieties tend to be colorful and highly
decorated.

### Use by fraternal orders

Many [fraternal orders](fraternal_order "wikilink") are known for
wearing fezzes. [Shriners](Shriners "wikilink") are often depicted
wearing a red fez; the headgear became official for the Shriners in
1872. [International Order of
Alhambra](International_Order_of_Alhambra "wikilink") wear a white fez.
[Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted
Realm](Mystic_Order_of_Veiled_Prophets_of_the_Enchanted_Realm "wikilink")
members wear a black fez. [Knights of Peter
Claver](Knights_of_Peter_Claver "wikilink") wear a blue fez. The
[Ancient Mystic Order of
Samaritans](Ancient_Mystic_Order_of_Samaritans "wikilink") wear various
colors of fezzes, based upon rank. The [Knights of
Khorassan](Dramatic_Order_of_the_Knights_of_Khorassan "wikilink") wear a
navy blue fez. The [Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of
the
World](Improved_Benevolent_and_Protective_Order_of_Elks_of_the_World "wikilink")
wear various colors of fezzes, based upon rank. The [Loyal Order of
Moose](Loyal_Order_of_Moose "wikilink")'s second degree body, the [Moose
Legion](Moose_Legion "wikilink"), wear a purple fez. In the [Laurel and
Hardy](Laurel_and_Hardy "wikilink") film *[Sons of the
Desert](Sons_of_the_Desert "wikilink")* members of the fictional order
of the same name wear fezzes, and consequently so do those of the Laurel
and Hardy [International Appreciation
Society](The_Sons_of_the_Desert "wikilink"), which is itself named after
and modelled on the one seen in the film.
