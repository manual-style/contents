\]\] A **flat cap** (sometimes " cap") is a rounded
[cap](cap "wikilink") with a small stiff brim in front. The hat is also
known in [Scotland](Scotland "wikilink") as a bunnet, in
[Wales](Wales "wikilink") as a Dai cap, in [New
Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink") as a cheese-cutter, and in the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") as a driving cap. Cloths used to make
the cap include wool, [tweed](Tweed_(cloth) "wikilink") (most common),
and cotton. Less common materials may include
[leather](leather "wikilink"), linen, or
[corduroy](corduroy "wikilink"). The inside of the cap is commonly lined
for comfort and warmth.

## History

`]]`

The style can be traced back to the 14th century in [Northern
England](Northern_England "wikilink"), when it was more likely to be
called a "[bonnet](Bonnet_(headgear) "wikilink")". This term was
replaced by "cap" before about 1700, except in
[Scotland](Scotland "wikilink"), where it continues to be referred to as
a *bunnet* in [Scots](Scots_language "wikilink").

A 1571 Act of the [English Parliament](Kingdom_of_England "wikilink")
was enacted to stimulate domestic wool consumption and general trade. It
decreed that on Sundays and holidays, all males over 6 years of age,
except for the nobility and "persons of degree", were to wear woollen
caps or pay a fine of three
[farthings](Farthing_(English_coin) "wikilink") (0.75 penny, or about
£0.003) per day. The Act was not repealed until 1597, though by then the
flat cap had become firmly entrenched as a recognised mark of a
non-noble subject , such as a [burgher](bourgeoisie "wikilink"), a
[tradesman](tradesman "wikilink"), or an
[apprentice](apprentice "wikilink"). The style may have been the same as
the [Tudor bonnet](Tudor_bonnet "wikilink") still used in some styles of
[academic dress](academic_dress "wikilink").

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, when men predominantly wore some
form of headgear, flat caps were commonly worn throughout Great Britain
and Ireland. Versions in finer cloth were also considered to be suitable
casual countryside wear for upper-class Englishmen. Flat caps were worn
by fashionable young men in the 1920s. Boys of all classes in the United
Kingdom wore flat caps during this period.

In the United States, the caps were worn from the 1890s. The cap grew in
popularity at the turn of the 20th century and was at the time standard
boys' wear. They were worn to school, for casual wear, and with suits.
Flat caps were almost always worn with knicker suits in the 1910s and
1920s. Both flat caps and
[knickerbockers](Knickerbockers_(clothing) "wikilink") declined in
popularity during the 1930s. The flat cap made its way to southern Italy
in the late 1800s, likely brought by British servicemen. In Turkey, the
flat cap became the main headgear for men after it became a replacement
for the [fez](fez "wikilink"), which was banned by [Mustafa Kemal
Atatürk](Mustafa_Kemal_Atatürk "wikilink") in 1925.

## Academic regalia

One of the flat hats worn in academia is known as a
[bonnet](Bonnet_(headgear) "wikilink") or [Tudor
bonnet](Tudor_bonnet "wikilink") and derives directly from medieval
headgear of the period of the original 1571 Act. It remains ceremonial
wear by members of the academic community in many countries, usually as
the headgear of [doctoral](doctorate "wikilink")
[graduates](graduates "wikilink"). Commonly, it has a soft, round
[crown](crown_(headgear) "wikilink") and a stiff, flat
[brim](brim_(hat) "wikilink"). The bonnet is often made of black velvet
and trimmed, between crown and brim, with gold [cord](Rope "wikilink")
and [tassels](tassels "wikilink"). Some universities opt to trim their
bonnets with coloured cord and tassels.

Some stylistic varieties of this bonnet are:

-   The [Canterbury cap](Canterbury_cap "wikilink") is a flat-topped,
    soft cloth hat with a round headband deeper at the back than at the
    front.
-   The Oxford bonnet has a black ribbon between crown and brim.
-   The John Knox cap is a soft, square cap made from black velvet and
    worn by the doctors of certain Scottish universities, as well as
    Durham University in England, the University of Calgary, and Queens'
    University in Canada. It is also worn by the holders of higher
    doctorates of the University of Liverpool and Victoria University of
    Wellington, New Zealand.

The [academic cap](academic_cap "wikilink") (mortar board), however, is
more widely used in academia.

## British popular culture

In [British popular culture](British_popular_culture "wikilink"), the
flat cap (or "flat hat") is typically associated with older
[working-class](working-class "wikilink") men, especially those in
[Northern England](Northern_England "wikilink"), and the [West
Country](West_Country "wikilink"), as personified by [Fred
Dibnah](Fred_Dibnah "wikilink") (Lancashire) and comic strip
[anti-hero](anti-hero "wikilink") [Andy Capp](Andy_Capp "wikilink")
(Teesside). The flat cap's strong connection with the working class and
the [East End](East_End_of_London "wikilink") of London is illustrated
by [Jim Branning](Jim_Branning "wikilink") of the television soap opera
*[EastEnders](EastEnders "wikilink")* and [Del-Boy
Trotter](Del-Boy_Trotter "wikilink") of *[Only Fools and
Horses](Only_Fools_and_Horses "wikilink")*. Taxicab and bus drivers are
often depicted wearing a flat cap, as comedically portrayed by Gareth
Hale and Norman Pace's ([Hale and Pace](Hale_and_Pace "wikilink"))
"London cabbies" television sketches. In the BBC show *[Peaky
Blinders](Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series) "wikilink")*, characters show their
membership of the Birmingham gang by sewing razor blades into the peak
of their flat caps, supposedly for use as a weapon.
[AC/DC](AC/DC "wikilink") vocalist [Brian
Johnson](Brian_Johnson "wikilink"), a native of
[Newcastle](Newcastle_upon_Tyne "wikilink"), customarily wears a flat
cap on stage and frequently off. The flat cap can also be taken to
denote the [upper class](upper_class "wikilink") when affecting
casualness. "A [toff](toff "wikilink") can be a bit of a chap as well
without, as it were, losing face."

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, British public figures
including [David Beckham](David_Beckham "wikilink"), [Guy
Ritchie](Guy_Ritchie "wikilink"), [Richard
Blackwood](Richard_Blackwood "wikilink"), and the [Prince of
Wales](Prince_Charles "wikilink") wore the flat cap.

## North American culture

The flat cap hat is associated in North American (chiefly US) popular
culture with city newsboys (i.e., street-corner newspaper sellers), the
style sometimes being called a "newsboy" or [newsboy
cap](newsboy_cap "wikilink"), sometimes referred to as a
"[Kangol](Kangol "wikilink") hat" due to conflation with the brand that
makes certain styles of flat caps.

## Current popularity

`is known for wearing a flat cap.]]`

The style has remained popular among groups of people in the United
Kingdom, Ireland, and North America. The cap is sometimes associated
with older men, significantly in [South Korea](South_Korea "wikilink"),
but has been popular (along with the newsboy cap) among some segments of
younger people, for example, in cities such as
[Boston](Boston "wikilink") and [Pittsburgh](Pittsburgh "wikilink") with
a large [Irish-American](Irish-American "wikilink") population. They are
also associated with [skinheads](skinhead "wikilink") and the
[Oi!](Oi! "wikilink") and [punk
subcultures](punk_subculture "wikilink"). It has appeared in the [hip
hop](hip_hop "wikilink") [subculture](subculture "wikilink"), sometimes
worn back-to-front or cocked to the side. It is also very common among
men and women in [San Francisco](San_Francisco "wikilink"),
[California](California "wikilink"). In [Turkey](Turkey "wikilink"), it
is highly popular amongst men, mostly working-class.

The English [rugby league](rugby_league "wikilink") team [Featherstone
Rovers](Featherstone_Rovers "wikilink") supporters' nickname is "the
Flat Cappers", because supporters in years gone by attended matches
wearing them as did most other teams' supporters.

The black leather flat cap is often combined with a patched-up [sport
coat](sport_coat "wikilink") or leather jacket and dark clothes
(sometimes combined with a [bee-striped convict’s
shirt](Prison_uniform#United_States_of_America "wikilink")) in popular
culture to depict a burglar, mugger, or robber, occasionally with a
[domino mask](domino_mask "wikilink"). The comic book character [the
Goon](the_Goon "wikilink") is based on this archetype of the flat-capped
street tough from vintage cartoons and comics.

The [Canadian](Canada "wikilink") team in the [1998 Winter
Olympics](1998_Winter_Olympics "wikilink") wore red flat caps designed
by [Roots](Roots_Canada "wikilink") in the opening ceremony parade of
nations. In addition, the US team in the [2008 Summer
Olympics](2008_Summer_Olympics "wikilink") also wore white flat caps
designed by [Polo Ralph Lauren](Polo_Ralph_Lauren "wikilink") during the
parade of nations.

In 2011, the flat cap increased in popularity in the UK possibly
influenced by photographs of celebrities—men and women—wearing caps.
Clothing sellers [Marks & Spencer](Marks_&_Spencer "wikilink") reported
that flat cap sales significantly increased in 2011.

It is commonly worn within the *[gopnik](gopnik "wikilink")* subculture
in Russia.
