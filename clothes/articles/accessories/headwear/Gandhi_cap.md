's life, poster from the 1950s, showing him wearing the Gandhi cap
during 1929–1955 \]\] The **Gandhi cap** ( ) is a white coloured
[sidecap](sidecap "wikilink"), pointed in front and back and having a
wide band. It is made out of *[khadi](khadi "wikilink")*. It takes its
name after the [Indian](India "wikilink") leader [Mahatma
Gandhi](Mahatma_Gandhi "wikilink"), who first popularised its use during
the [Indian independence
movement](Indian_independence_movement "wikilink"). Worn commonly by
[Indian independence
activists](Indian_independence_activists "wikilink"), it became a
symbolic tradition for politicians and political activists to wear it in
independent India.

## Genesis

`wearing Gandhi Cap in 1920]]`

The Gandhi cap emerged in India during the First [Non-cooperation
movement](Non-cooperation_movement "wikilink") during 1918–1921. when it
became the standard Congress dress as popularized by Gandhi. In 1921,
the British government tried to ban the use of the Gandhi cap. Gandhi
himself wore the cap only for one or two years during 1920–21. Gandhi
was photographed wearing a turban or a round black topi in 1915 and
1918. He was photographed with the Gandhi cap in 1920. see 1915-1932

Gandhi's homespun *khadi* attire of traditional Indian clothes were
symbolic of his message of cultural pride, the use of
*[Swadeshi](Swadeshi "wikilink")* goods (as opposed to those
manufactured in Europe), self-reliance and solidarity with India's rural
masses. The cap became common to most followers of Gandhi and members of
the [Indian National Congress](Indian_National_Congress "wikilink"). A
connection to the independence movement was implied when any individual
wore the cap in those times.

Prisoners in South African prisons classified as "negroes" (a category
into which Indians fell while Gandhi was in South Africa) also were
required to wear similar caps in prison during 1907 to 1914. Gandhi's
close friend Henry Polak cites Gandhi's time in South African jail,
where he was classified as a "negro" and thus required to wear such a
cap, as the genesis of the Gandhi Cap.

## After independence

The first generation of post-independence Indian politicians were almost
universally members of the freedom struggle. Gandhi's death in 1948 gave
an emotional importance to the Gandhi cap, which was regularly worn by
Indian leaders like [Jawaharlal Nehru](Jawaharlal_Nehru "wikilink"),
India's first [Prime Minister](Prime_Minister "wikilink"). Succeeding
prime minister such as [Lal Bahadur
Shastri](Lal_Bahadur_Shastri "wikilink") and [Morarji
Desai](Morarji_Desai "wikilink") would continue the tradition. Most
members of the [Indian Parliament](Indian_Parliament "wikilink")
(especially politicians and activists of the Congress party) wore
*khadi* clothing and the *Gandhi cap*. Large numbers of people donned
the cap when celebrating India's independence on August 15 or the
promulgation of a [republic](republic "wikilink") on January 26.
Jawarharlal Nehru was always remembered as having worn the cap. In 1964
a coin showing Nehru in profile was released which was widely criticized
for lacking the cap. Another Nehru coin was later released in 1989 on
his birth centenary, which showed him wearing a cap. In later times, the
cap had lost its popular and political appeal. Although many members of
the Congress party continued the tradition, rival political parties
preferred to dissociate themselves from the tradition linked with the
Congress. The mass acceptance of Western-style clothing had also
diminished the importance of wearing Indian-style clothes for
politicians.

headgear worn by men in rural parts of
[Maharashtra](Maharashtra "wikilink").

`protesting against corruption ]]`

In the "[I Have a Dream](I_Have_a_Dream "wikilink")" speech of [Martin
Luther King, Jr](Martin_Luther_King,_Jr "wikilink") in 1963, one can see
people standing behind him on stage wearing Gandhi caps.

## Re-emergence

In 2011, the Gandhi cap once again rose in popularity in India after
[Anna Hazare](Anna_Hazare "wikilink"), an eminent Gandhian from
[Maharashtra](Maharashtra "wikilink"), started an anti-corruption
movement in India. The epicenter of this movement was in Delhi. In
August 2011, thousands of people wearing Gandhi caps accumulated at
[Ramlila Maidan](Ramlila_Maidan "wikilink") in Delhi to support Anna
Hazare on his fast-unto-death. This movement spilled over to many other
parts of the country and stadiums, community centers and grounds were
booked for assimilation of a similar nature. The mass movement witnessed
people of all age groups, religions and social standings (mainly the
[Middle Class](Middle_Class "wikilink")) as participants, many among
them shouting slogans and wearing Gandhi caps.

In the 2014 election, the workers of [Aam Aadmi
Party](Aam_Aadmi_Party "wikilink") widely wore the Gandhi cap with text
printed on it. [BJP](BJP "wikilink") supporters wore a similar saffron
colored cap.
