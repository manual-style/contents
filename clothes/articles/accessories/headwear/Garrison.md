**Garrison** (various spellings) (from the
[French](French_language "wikilink") *garnison*, itself from the verb
*garnir*, "to equip") is the collective term for any body of
[troops](troop "wikilink") stationed in a particular location,
originally to guard it, but now often simply using it as a home base.
The garrison is usually in a [city](city "wikilink"),
[town](town "wikilink"), [fort](fort "wikilink"),
[castle](castle "wikilink"), [ship](ship "wikilink") or similar.
"Garrison town" is a common expression for any town that has a [military
base](military_base "wikilink") nearby.

## Arab garrison

"Garrison towns" ( ) were used during the [Arab Islamic
conquests](Muslim_conquests "wikilink") of Middle Eastern lands by
[Arab](Arabs "wikilink")-[Muslim](Muslim "wikilink") armies to increase
their dominance over indigenous populations. In order to occupy
non-Arab, non-Islamic areas, nomadic Arab tribesmen were taken from the
desert by the ruling Arab elite, conscripted into Islamic armies, and
settled into garrison towns as well as given a share in the [spoils of
war](Jizya "wikilink"). The primary utility of the Arab-Islamic
garrisons was to control the indigenous non-Arab peoples of these
conquered and occupied territories, and to serve as garrison bases to
launch further Islamic military campaigns into yet-undominated lands. A
secondary aspect of the Arab-Islamic garrisons was the uprooting of the
aforementioned nomadic Arab tribesmen from their original home regions
in the [Arabian Peninsula](Arabian_Peninsula "wikilink") in order to
proactively avert these tribal peoples, and particularly their young
men, from revolting against the Islamic state established in their
midst.

## British and Irish garrison

In the [United Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink"), "Garrison" also

commanded by a [colonel](Colonel_(United_Kingdom) "wikilink"),
[brigadier](brigadier "wikilink") or
[major-general](Major_General "wikilink"), assisted by a [garrison
sergeant major](garrison_sergeant_major "wikilink"). In

military serving in Irish cities and towns.

## Israeli garrison

In [Israel](Israel "wikilink"), a "garrison unit" ( ) is a regular unit

citizens in conquered towns as a kind of garrison.
