**Green eyeshades** are a type of [visor](visor "wikilink") that were
worn most often from the late-19th century to the mid-20th century by
[accountants](accountant "wikilink"),
[telegraphers](telegrapher "wikilink"), [copy
editors](copy_editor "wikilink") and others engaged in vision-intensive,
detail-oriented occupations to lessen eyestrain due to early
[incandescent lights](incandescent_light "wikilink") and candles, which
tended to be harsh (the classic [banker's
lamp](banker's_lamp "wikilink") had a green shade for similar reasons).
Because they were often worn by people involved in
[accounting](accounting "wikilink"), [auditing](auditing "wikilink"),
economics, and budgeting, they became associated with these activities.

Green eyeshades were often made of a transparent dark green or
blue-green colored [celluloid](celluloid "wikilink"), although leather
and paper were used to make the visor portion as well. One manufacturer,
the Featherweight Eyeshade Company, described their eyeshade as
"healthful, color peculiarly restful to the eyes". Green eyeshades are
still on the market, typically sold as "[dealer](Croupier "wikilink")'s
visors". They retain a certain degree of popularity in the gambling
community.

Several individuals, including William Mahony, received patents for
their eyeshade designs. The phrase "green eye-shades" can be applied to
individuals who are excessively concerned with financial matters or
small and insignificant details and is used even as recently as 2013 in
[U.S. Budget Committee](U.S._Budget "wikilink") Hearings.
