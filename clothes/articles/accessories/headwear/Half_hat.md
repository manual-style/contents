`wore a half-hat with a `[`halo-effect`` ``brim`](Halo_hat "wikilink")` in the 1953 film `*[`Roman`` ``Holiday`](Roman_Holiday "wikilink")*`]]`

A **half hat** (also sometimes **half-hat**) is a millinery design in
which the hat covers part of the head. Generally, the design is
close-fitting, in the manner of the [cloche](Cloche_hat "wikilink"), and
frames the head, usually stopping just above the ears. It may be similar
to a [halo hat](halo_hat "wikilink") in the way that it frames the face
and can be worn straight or at an angle.

The half-hat is said to have been created by the French-born and
US-based milliner [Lilly Daché](Lilly_Daché "wikilink"), who won an
award for the design in 1941.

## History and usage

The half hat became popular in the [post-war](World_War_II "wikilink")
period, especially in the 1950s. This was a design considered suitable
for day and evening wear, and some designs included details such as
sequins and veils. Designs were often stiffened to create a halo shape –
a 1952 design from Ascot Millinery was made of decorated straw with an
inner lining of velvet.

While many designs stopped a little way beyond the crown of the head,
there was also a fashion for more
[bonnet](Bonnet_(headgear) "wikilink")-like shapes to half hats. Writing
in *[The Guardian](The_Guardian "wikilink")*, also in 1952, fashion
correspondent Phyllis Heathcote reported on the off-the-brow trend
emerging from Paris, noting: "the majority of the hats are still very
small, very soft, and very much alike, except – and this is important –
that whereas last season and the one before the tendency was to an
arched line over the front of the head, leaving the back uncovered, this
season the movement tends to uncover the front and cover the back".
Heathcote also noted the practicality of this shape, describing it as a
design that could be folded up and stowed in a handbag or pocket. Such
was its popularity in the United States – particularly when embellished
– that a 1957 report in *[The Times](The_Times "wikilink")* on American
hat fashions said: "The hat norm, godlike for Hera, is regal for
American womanhood...the half-hat, usually jewelled, is plainly a
diadem, sometimes secured by jewelled springs behind the head".

This was a hat design that became popular with brides. A 1955 wedding
reported in *The Times* describes the bride wearing: "a beige lace dress
of ballerina length with a high upturned collar and a half-hat to match
trimmed with fine light-brown feathers".

### Variations

The half hat could be shaped close to frame the skull in the manner of
the [Juliet cap](Juliet_cap "wikilink") (also known as a capulet) and
some variations were known as the cape hat; typically in these designs
draped fabric or felt was attached to a bicycle clip, creating a more
scarf-like effect. A design of this style worn by [Queen
Elizabeth](Elizabeth_II "wikilink") during a 1954 tour of Australia had
the addition of a pom-pom.
