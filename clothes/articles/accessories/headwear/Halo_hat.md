A **halo hat** (sometimes **halo brim hat**) is a millinery design in
which the headgear acts as a circular frame for the face, creating a
halo effect. The design is said to date back to the late 19th century,
when it was known as the **aureole hat**; this name is sometimes still
used. It may also be known as the *angel hat* or *bambini* – the latter
said to derive from Italian for terracotta plaques depicting the infant
Christ.

A halo hat may be a wide range of sizes – some lying close to the head
in the style of a [bonnet](Bonnet_(headgear) "wikilink") or
[cloche](Cloche_hat "wikilink") and others that are similar in
dimensions to a [picture](Picture_hat "wikilink") or [cartwheel
hat](cartwheel_hat "wikilink"). Typically, designs are worn towards the
back of the head to create the 'halo' effect. Some designs with open
crowns may also be referred to as halo hats or as diadems. Popular from
the 1930s on, the halo hat was created in a variety of fabrics – knitted
or crocheted versions could be made at home – and could be a circle or
semi-circle in shape. The halo became popular with brides; one of the
most famous examples is the blue straw half-circle halo created for the
wedding of [Wallis Simpson](Wedding_dress_of_Wallis_Warfield "wikilink")
by the Parisian millinery house of [Caroline
Reboux](Caroline_Reboux "wikilink").

## History

The halo hat is said to have first come into fashion the late 1880s,
when it was usually known as an aureole hat (a synonym for halo), and
this was a name that continued to be used to describe the circular or
semi-circular shape into the 1930s. Similarly, describing the outfits
worn by racegoers at a [Sandown Park](Sandown_Park "wikilink") meet in
1937, *[The Times](The_Times "wikilink")* referred to an:
"aureole-brimmed" hat design.

### 1930s popularity

The halo shape became popular again from the start of the 1930s in both
the United States and Europe. It was a distinct move away from the
cloche style that was worn low over the brow, as the halo exposed the
face and brow, also showing off more elaborate curled hairstyles
becoming popular during this era.

"Halo hats are so new" declared an advert in a US newspaper in 1931. A
1934 [Sears catalogue](Sears "wikilink") featured a halo hat design as
part of its [Loretta Young](Loretta_Young "wikilink") collection,
adding: "Take advantage of Loretta Young's fashion judgement and wear
this new off-the-face hat! It's *different*...There's something of the
angel's halo and something of the bucaneer's bravado in its dramatic,
folded-back brim".

In 1933 *The Times* reviewed the Christmas catalogues, saying: "the new
season millinery, with its leading novelty, the 'halo' hat, is specially
interesting". The following year, the [Duchess of
York](Queen_Elizabeth_the_Queen_Mother "wikilink") was described as
wearing a [velvet](velvet "wikilink") halo hat to attend a charity
matinee with [Princess Elizabeth](Elizabeth_II "wikilink"). Three years
later, Wallis Simpson would wear an iconic gown and halo bridal
headpiece, made by Caroline Reboux's studio in Paris and trimmed with
pink and blue feathers.

## Design variations

The halo was a flexible design. While it could create a large frame
around the face – as with the circular straw design that featured on the
*[Picture Post](Picture_Post "wikilink")* in 1940 – it could also have
more modest proportions. It could also be made at home; a variety of
patterns were created during the 1940s to inspire knitters and sewers.
Larger versions suited the post-war [New
Look](Christian_Dior_S.A.#The_.22New_Look.22 "wikilink") designs,
balancing the proportions of the full skirts that were fashionable after
[wartime](World_War_II "wikilink") austerity.

The halo-style hat became popular for wedding outfits – future [First
Lady](First_Lady_of_the_United_States "wikilink") of the United States
[Betty Ford](Betty_Ford "wikilink") wore a large-brimmed halo wedding
hat in 1938 – and half halos would become a staple design for more
traditional wedding headpieces, remaining popular in bridal designs.

### Revivals

In the mid 1960s, [British Pathé](British_Pathé "wikilink")'s 1964 film
*Hats on for Winter* featured a large-scale halo design with sunburst
pattern, alongside visors and caps. Designers such as [Graham
Smith](Graham_Smith_(milliner) "wikilink") created oversized examples
during the late 1980s.

Among the most memorable modern halo-shaped hats are the design created
by [Philip Treacy](Philip_Treacy "wikilink") for influential fashion
editor [Isabella Blow](Isabella_Blow "wikilink"), and the wheatsheaf
halo-effect headpiece he designed for the wedding of [Camilla Parker
Bowles](Wedding_of_Charles,_Prince_of_Wales,_and_Camilla_Parker_Bowles "wikilink")
to Prince Charles.
