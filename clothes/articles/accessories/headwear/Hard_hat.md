A **hard hat** is a type of [helmet](helmet "wikilink") predominantly
used in workplace environments such as industrial or
[construction](construction "wikilink") sites to protect the
[head](Human_head "wikilink") from injury due to falling objects, impact
with other objects, debris, rain, and electric shock. Suspension bands
inside the helmet spread the helmet's weight and the force of any impact
over the top of the head. A suspension also provides space of
approximately 30 mm (1.2 inches) between the helmet's shell and the
wearer's head, so that if an object strikes the shell, the impact is
less likely to be transmitted directly to the skull. Some helmet shells
have a mid-line reinforcement ridge to improve impact resistance. The
[rock climbing helmet](Rock-climbing_equipment#Helmet "wikilink")
fulfills a very similar role in a different context and has a very
similar design.

A **bump cap** is a lightweight hard hat using a simplified suspension
or padding and a chin strap. Bump caps are used where there is a
possibility of scraping or bumping one's head on equipment or structure
projections but are not sufficient to absorb large impacts, such as that
from a tool dropped from several stories.

## History

In the early years of the shipbuilding industry, workers covered their
hats with pitch (tar), and set them in the sun to cure, a common
practice for dock workers in constant danger of being hit on the head by
objects dropped from ship decks.

Management professor [Peter Drucker](Peter_Drucker "wikilink") credited
writer [Franz Kafka](Franz_Kafka "wikilink") with developing the first
civilian hard hat while employed at the Worker's Accident Insurance
Institute for the [Kingdom of Bohemia](Kingdom_of_Bohemia "wikilink")
(1912), but this information is not supported by any document from his
employer.

In the United States, the E.D. Bullard Company was a mining equipment
firm in California created by Edward Dickinson Bullard in 1898, a
veteran of the industrial safety business for 20 years. The company sold
protective hats made of leather. His son, E. W. Bullard, returned home
from [World War I](World_War_I "wikilink") with a steel helmet that
provided him with ideas to improve industrial safety. In 1919 Bullard
patented a "hard-boiled hat" made of steamed canvas, glue and black
paint. That same year, the U.S. Navy commissioned Bullard to create a
[shipyard](shipyard "wikilink") protective cap that began the widespread
use of hard hats. Not long after, Bullard developed an internal
suspension to provide a more effective hat. These early designs bore a
resemblance to the military [M1917 "Brodie"
helmet](Brodie_helmet "wikilink") that served as their inspiration.

On the [Hoover Dam](Hoover_Dam "wikilink") project in 1931, hard hat use
was mandated by [Six Companies, Inc.](Six_Companies,_Inc. "wikilink") In
1933, construction began on the [Golden Gate
Bridge](Golden_Gate_Bridge "wikilink") in San Francisco California.
Construction workers were required to wear hard hats, by order of
[Joseph Strauss](Joseph_Strauss_(engineer) "wikilink"), project chief
engineer. Strauss strove to create a safe workplace; hence, he installed
safety nets and required hard hats to be worn while on the job site.
Strauss also asked Bullard to create a hard hat to protect workers who
performed [sandblasting](sandblasting "wikilink"). Bullard produced a
design that covered the worker's face, provided a window for vision and
a supply of fresh air via a hose connected to an air compressor. In
those times many workmen's safety helmets were made of steel.

[Aluminum](Aluminium "wikilink") became a standard for hard hats around
1938, except for electrical applications.
[MSA](Mine_Safety_Appliances "wikilink") introduced the new plastic
Skullgard Helmet in 1930 for the metals industry to withstand radiant
heat loads of up to 350 °F (177 °C). New plastic
[Bakelite](Bakelite "wikilink") was used to provide protection rigid
enough to withstand hard sudden impacts within a high-heat environment
but still be light enough for practical use. The machinery of the times
required that helmet materials used be electrically non-conducting.
Bakelite resin compounded with wire screen and linen, the Skullgard
Helmet is still manufactured. MSA also produced a low-crown version for
coal miners known as Comfo-Cap Headgear.

[Fiberglass](Glass-reinforced_plastic "wikilink") came into use in the
1940s.

[Thermoplastics](Thermoplastics "wikilink") took over in the 1950s, as
they are easy to mold and shape with heat and cost less to manufacture.
In 1952, MSA offered the Shockgard Helmet to protect electrical linemen
from electrical shock of up to 10,000 volts. In 1961, MSA released the
Topgard Helmet, the first polycarbonate hard hat. 1962 brought the
V-Gard Helmet, which today is the most widely used hardhat in the United
States. Today, most hard hats are made from [high-density
polyethylene](high-density_polyethylene "wikilink") (HDPE) or advanced
engineering resins, such as [Ultem](Ultem "wikilink").

In 1997 [ANSI](ANSI "wikilink") allowed the development of a ventilated
hard hat to keep wearers cooler. Accessories such as [face
shields](face_shield "wikilink"), [sun visors](sun_visor "wikilink"),
[earmuffs](earmuffs "wikilink"), and
[perspiration](perspiration "wikilink")-absorbing lining cloths could
also be used; today, attachments include [radios](radio "wikilink"),
[walkie-talkies](walkie-talkie "wikilink"), [pagers](pager "wikilink"),
and [cameras](camera "wikilink").

## Design

Because hard hats are intended to protect the wearer's head from
impacts, hats are made from durable materials, originally from
[metal](metal "wikilink"), then [fiberglass](fiberglass "wikilink"), and
most-commonly (from the 1950s onward) rigid
[plastic](plastic "wikilink").

Some contemporary cap-style hard hats feature a rolled edge that acts as
a [rain gutter](rain_gutter "wikilink") to channel rainwater to the
front, allowing water to drain off the bill, instead of running down the
wearer's neck. A **cowboy hard hat** is a hard hat resembling a wide
brimmed [cowboy hat](cowboy_hat "wikilink"), although some organizations
disallow their use.

Organizations issuing hard hats often include their names and/or logos
(or some other message) on the front of each hard hat.

### Accessories

Hard hats may also be fitted with:

-   A [visor](visor "wikilink"):
    -   As in a [welding helmet](welding_helmet "wikilink"), or
    -   A safety [visor](visor "wikilink").
-   An extra-wide brim attachment for additional shade.
-   [Ear protectors](Earmuffs "wikilink").
-   [Mirrors](Mirror "wikilink") for increased rear field-of-view.
-   A small device that is used to mount a
    [headlamp](Headlamp_(outdoor) "wikilink") or
    [flashlight](flashlight "wikilink") to a hard hat. The mounting
    device frees hands to continue working rather than having to hold a
    flashlight.
-   A [chinstrap](wikt:chinstrap "wikilink") to keep the helmet from
    falling off if the wearer leans over.
-   Thick insulating side pads to keep sides of the head warm. Examples
    are seen in *[Ice Road Truckers](Ice_Road_Truckers "wikilink")*.
-   [Silicone](Silicone "wikilink") bands stretched around the brim for
    color worker
    [ID](Identifier#Identifiers_in_various_disciplines "wikilink") and
    [Hi Viz](High-visibility_clothing "wikilink") night
    retro-reflectivity.

### Colors and identification

Hard hat colors can signify different roles on construction sites. These
color designations vary from company to company and work site to work
site. Government agencies such as the [United States
Navy](United_States_Navy "wikilink") and
[DOT](United_States_Department_of_Transportation "wikilink") have their
own hard hat color scheme that may apply to subcontractors. On very
large projects involving a number of companies, employees of the same
company may wear the same color hat.

The most common color scheme is white for managers, architects,
engineers, foremen or supervisors. Other hard hat styles may be required
for a job; brown fiberglass hard hats are worn by welders and other
workers for high heat applications. Green often signifies a safety
inspector, but is also used for new workers. General laborers and
earth-moving operators often wear yellow. Carpenters, technical advisers
and temps may wear blue or orange. Orange is sometimes used for road
crews, new employees or visitors. Some companies offer loaner hard hats
in pink for workers who forget their own hard hat; the color operates as
both a stigmatization penalty and a deterrent against theft. At one
time, blasters traditionally wore red.

### Stickers

Supervisors often are not familiar with all workers on a construction
site. Often, stickers, labels and markers are used to mark hard hats so
that important information can be shared. Paint or permanent markers can
degrade the plastic in hard hats; instead, labels or masking tape are
often applied to a hard hat with the worker's name written on it.
Stickers with company logos are common. Stickers that indicate a
worker's training or qualifications are also common; many companies
provide ready-made stickers to indicate that a worker has been trained
in electrical safety, confined space safety, excavation trench safety,
or operation of specialized equipment. Environmental monitors often make
stickers to indicate that the worker has been educated on the risk of
unexploded ordnance or the archaeological/biological sensitivity of a
given area. Stickers may indicate who is authorized to be present on
site. Unions may offer free stickers for hard hats and other objects.

A hard hat also provides workers with a distinctive profile, readily
identifiable even in peripheral vision, for safety around equipment or
traffic. Peripheral vision registers shapes but not colors; the obvious
shape of a hard hat is therefore easier for machine operators to
recognize and avoid. Some companies also require reflective tape to be
applied to hard hats to increase visibility of workers at night.

## Standards

OSHA regulation 1910.135 states that the employer shall ensure that each
affected employee wears a protective helmet when working in areas where
there is a potential for injury to the head from falling objects.
Additionally, the employer shall ensure that a protective helmet
designed to reduce electrical shock hazard is worn by each such affected
employee when near exposed electrical conductors which could contact the
head.

The OSHA regulation does not specifically cover any criteria for the
protective helmets, instead OSHA requires that protective helmets comply
with ANSI/ISEA Z89.1-2014 – American National Standard for Industrial
Head Protection.

Each hard hat is specified by both Type and Class. Types include:

-   [ANSI](ANSI "wikilink") Type I /
    [CSA](Canadian_Standards_Association "wikilink") Type 1 hard hats
    meet stringent vertical impact and penetration requirements.
-   ANSI Type II / CSA Type 2 hard hats meet both vertical and lateral
    impact and penetration requirements and have a foam inner liner made
    of [expanded polystyrene](expanded_polystyrene "wikilink") (EPS).

Classes:

-   Class E (Electrical) provides dielectric protection up to 20,000
    volts.
-   Class G (General) provides dielectric protection up to 2,200 volts.
-   Class C (Conductive) provides no dielectric protection.

A hard hat is specified by both Type and Class; for example: *Type I
Class G.*

ANSI standards for hard hats set
[combustibility](combustibility "wikilink") or
[flammability](flammability "wikilink") criteria. ANSI Z89 standard was
significantly revised in 1986, 1997 and 2003. The current American
standard for hard hats is ISEA Z89.1-2009, by the [International Safety
Equipment
Association](International_Safety_Equipment_Association "wikilink") that
took over publication of the Z89 standard from ANSI. The ISO standard
for industrial protective headgear is ISO 3873, first published in 1977.

In the UK, the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Regulations 1992
specifies that hard hats are a component of PPE and, by law, all those
working on construction sites or within hazardous environments are
required to wear hard hats.

In Europe all hard hats must have a manufacturer set lifespan, this can
be determined from the expiry date or a set period from the manufacture
date, which is either stuck to the inside or embossed in the hard hat's
material.
