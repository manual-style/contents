A **hat** is a head covering which is worn for various reasons,
including protection against weather conditions, ceremonial reasons such
as university graduation, religious reasons, safety, or as a fashion
accessory. In the past, hats were an indicator of social status. In the
military, hats may denote nationality, branch of service, rank or
regiment. Police typically wear distinctive hats such as peaked caps or
brimmed hats, such as those worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Some hats have a protective function. As examples, the hard hat protects
construction workers' heads from injury by falling objects and a British
police Custodian helmet protects the officer's head, a sun hat shades
the face and shoulders from the sun, a cowboy hat protects against sun
and rain and an ushanka fur hat with fold-down earflaps keeps the head
and ears warm. Some hats are worn for ceremonial purposes, such as the
mortarboard, which is worn (or carried) during university graduation
ceremonies. Some hats are worn by members of a certain profession, such
as the Toque worn by chefs. Some hats have religious functions, such as
the mitres worn by Bishops and the turban worn by Sikhs.
