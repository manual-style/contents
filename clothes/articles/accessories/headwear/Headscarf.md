around the neck.\|252x252px](/Image:Martin_Kober_002.jpg "wikilink") A
**headscarf**, or **head scarf**, is a [scarf](/scarf "wikilink")
covering most or all of the top of a person's, usually women's, hair and
head, leaving the face uncovered. A headscarf is formed of a triangular
cloth or a square cloth folded into a triangle, with which the head is
covered.

## Purposes

Headscarves may be worn for a variety of purposes, such as protection of
the head or hair from rain, wind, dirt, cold, warmth, for sanitation,
for [fashion](/fashion "wikilink"), recognition or
[social](/social "wikilink") distinction; with
[religious](/religious "wikilink") significance, to hide
[baldness](/baldness "wikilink"), out of modesty, or other forms of
social convention.[1][2] Headscarves are now mainly worn for practical,
cultural or religious reasons.

Until the latter 20th century, headscarves were commonly worn by women
in many parts of the [Southwestern Asia](/Southwestern_Asia "wikilink"),
[Europe](/Europe "wikilink"), [North Africa](/North_Africa "wikilink"),
and the [Americas](/Americas "wikilink"), as well as some other parts of
the world. In recent decades, headscarves, like hats, have fallen out of
favor in Western culture. They are still, though, common in many rural
areas of Eastern Europe as well as many areas of the Middle East.

A form of headscarf, known as the [hijab](/hijab "wikilink"), is
commonly seen in Muslim countries and is born out of [qur'anic
tradition](/Quran "wikilink"). It is worn primarily by Muslim women for
fashion and religious purposes, and its style varies by culture.[3]

### Religious use

Headscarves may specifically have a [religious](/Religion "wikilink")
significance or function, or be expected as a matter of [social
custom](/social_custom "wikilink"), the two very often being confused.

#### Islam

[Islam](/Islam "wikilink") promotes modest dress among women. Many
[Muslim](/Muslim "wikilink") women wear a headscarf, often known as a
*[hijab](/hijab "wikilink")* and in Quranic Arabic as the
[khimar](/khimar "wikilink"). Many of these garments cover the hair,
ears and throat, but do not cover the face. The
[Keffiyeh](/Keffiyeh "wikilink") is commonly used by Muslim men, as for
example [Yasser Arafat](/Yasser_Arafat "wikilink") who adopted a black
and white fishnet-patterned keffiyeh as a hallmark.

Headscarves and veils are commonly used by observant Muslim women and
girls, and required by law for women and girls in certain Muslim
countries (Saudi Arabia for example). The [Muslim religious
dress](/Islam_and_clothing "wikilink") varies, and various cultures
include *[burqa](/burqa "wikilink")*, *[chador](/chador "wikilink")*,
*[niqab](/niqab "wikilink")*, *[dupatta](/dupatta "wikilink")*, or
[other types of *hijab*](/Types_of_hijab "wikilink"). The religion
prescribes modest behaviour or dress in general, and in particular the
headscarf worn by Muslim women and girls.[4]

#### Judaism

Religions such as [Judaism](/Judaism "wikilink") under
[Halakhah](/Halakhah "wikilink") (Jewish Law) promote modest dress among
women and men. Many married [Orthodox
Jewish](/Orthodox_Jewish "wikilink") women wear a scarf
*([tichel](/tichel "wikilink"))* to cover their hair. The
[Tallit](/Tallit "wikilink") is commonly worn by Jewish men especially
for prayers, which they use to cover their head in order to recite the
blessings, although not all men do this. It also may not apply to the
entire prayer service, sometimes only specific sections such as the
Amidah. The [Kohanim](/Kohanim "wikilink") (priests) also cover their
heads and shoulders with the tallit during the priestly blessing so as
to conform to [Halakah](/Halakah "wikilink") which states that the hands
of the priests should not be seen during this time as their mystical
significance to the hand position.

#### Christianity

[thumb\|187x187px\|[Hutterite](Hutterite "wikilink") Christian women
wear headscarves.](/File:Hutterite_Sunset.jpg "wikilink") Until at least
the 18th century, the wearing of a
[headcovering](/Christian_headcovering "wikilink") for the hair was
regarded as customary for Christian women in Mediterranean, European,
Middle Eastern, and African cultures, to agree with contemporary notions
of modesty and as an indication of married status; the "matron's cap" is
a general term for these.[5] This practice was derived from the
[Christian Bible](/Christian_Bible "wikilink"), specifically, , which
has traditionally been interpreted to mandate the wearing of a
headcovering by Christian women.[6][7] To some extent, the covering of
the head depended on where the woman was; indoors and at home it was
less worn, but it was usual outside and on formal occasions, especially
in church.[8] Women who did not wear headcoverings were interpreted to
be "a prostitute or adulteress".[9][10] In Europe, law stipulated that
married women who uncovered their head in public was evidence of her
infidelity.[11] The [Roman Catholic
Church](/Roman_Catholic_Church "wikilink") required all women to wear a
[Christian headcovering](/Christian_headcovering "wikilink") over their
hair in church until the 1960s; in [Spain](/Spain "wikilink"), these
take the form of the [mantilla](/mantilla "wikilink"). Women meeting the
Pope in formal audiences are still expected to wear them. [Martin
Luther](/Martin_Luther "wikilink"), the German
[Reformer](/Reformation "wikilink"), as well as [John
Calvin](/John_Calvin "wikilink"), a major figure in the Reformed
Churches, also expected women to cover their heads in church, as did
[John Wesley](/John_Wesley "wikilink"), the founder of the [Methodist
Churches](/Methodist_Church "wikilink").[12]

In many rural areas, women, especially widows, continue to observe the
traditional Christian custom of headcovering, especially in the
Mediterranean, as well as in [eastern](/Eastern_Europe "wikilink") and
[southern Europe](/southern_Europe "wikilink"); in [South
Asia](/South_Asia "wikilink"), it is common for Christian women to wear
a headcovering called a [dupatta](/dupatta "wikilink").[13] At times the
styles of covering using simple cloth became very elaborate, with
complicated layers and folding, held in place with [hair
pins](/hair_pins "wikilink"). Among the many terms for head-coverings
made of flexible cloth are [wimple](/wimple "wikilink"),
[hennin](/hennin "wikilink"), [kerchief](/kerchief "wikilink"), [gable
hood](/gable_hood "wikilink"), as well as light hats, [mob
caps](/mob_cap "wikilink") and [bonnets](/Bonnet_(headgear) "wikilink").

Many [Anabaptist Christian](/Anabaptist_Christian "wikilink") women
([Amish](/Amish "wikilink")/[Para-Amish](/Para-Amish "wikilink"),
[Brethren](/Brethren_(religious_group) "wikilink"),
[Bruderhof](/Bruderhof "wikilink"), [Hutterites](/Hutterites "wikilink")
and [Mennonites](/Mennonites "wikilink")) wear their headscarf at all
times, except when sleeping.[14]

In countries with large [Eastern Orthodox
Christianity](/Orthodox_Christian "wikilink") population such as
[Romania](/Romania "wikilink") [15] or Russia[16] headscarves and veils
are used by Christian women in the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental
Orthodox Church, Assyrian Church of the East, and Roman Catholic
Church.[17][18][19] A few years back, all women in Russia who attended
Divine Liturgy wore head-coverings. A woman having her head covered
means that she honors the Lord. Head-coverings also symbolizes that a
woman is married and that her husband is the head of the family. Little
girls also have their heads covered when they go to Mass at church, not
because they are married, but in order to honor the Lord. Today, young
Russian Orthodox women and little girls still cover their heads when
going to church, although it differs in style from those worn by women
of older age (grandmothers).

Some English speakers use the word
"[babushka](/babushka_(disambiguation) "wikilink")" (the word for
'grandma' in ) to indicate a headscarf tied below the chin, as still
commonly worn in rural parts of [Europe](/Europe "wikilink"). In many
parts of Europe, headscarves are used mainly by elderly women and this
led to the use of the term "babushka", a
[Slavic](/Slavic_languages "wikilink") word meaning 'grandmother'. Some
types of head coverings that Russian women wear are:
[circlet](/circlet "wikilink"), [veil](/veil "wikilink"), and
[wimple](/wimple "wikilink").

#### Sikhism

Young [Sikhs](/Sikhs "wikilink") often wear a cloth wrapping to cover
their hair, before moving on to the turban. Older Sikhs may wear them as
an under-turban.

### Use while working

Practical reasons for headscarf use at work include protection from bad
weather and protection against industrial contamination, for example in
dusty and oily environments. A headscarf can ensure that the hair does
not interfere with the work and get caught-up in machinery since long
hair can get into rotating parts of machines, so this is avoided either
by means of a suitable head covering like a cap, hairnet or kerchief;
cutting the hair short; or by putting on a headscarf.
[Hygiene](/Hygiene "wikilink") also requires wearing a head cover at
some workplaces, for example in kitchens and hospitals. Such usage has
gone on since about 1900, when women's use of [mob
caps](/mob_cap "wikilink") and [Dutch bonnets](/Dutch_bonnet "wikilink")
declined.

Workers wore them at work to protect their hair from dirt. Farmers used
them to see off the weather and dirt. Soviet labour units of the 1930s
and 1940s wore them as part of their uniform (where uniforms were
available). This habit was common until about the 1950s in the West for
farmers and 1960s factory workers, and 1970s in the former USSR for
farmers and factory workers.

portrayed by [Jean Alexander](/Jean_Alexander "wikilink"), became famous
throughout the nation for combining a headscarf with [hair
curlers](/hair_curlers "wikilink"). So famous was she that, in 1982, she
came fourth behind the [Queen Mother](/Elizabeth_Bowes-Lyon "wikilink"),
[Queen Elizabeth II](/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"),
and [Diana, Princess of Wales](/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales "wikilink") in
a poll of the most recognisable women in Britain.[20]
