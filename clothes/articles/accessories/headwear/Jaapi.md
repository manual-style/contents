The **jaapi** or **japi** ( ; [Bodo](Bodo_culture "wikilink"): Khomfri)
is a traditional conical hat from [Assam](Assam "wikilink"),
[India](India "wikilink") which is made from tightly woven
[bamboo](bamboo "wikilink") and/or cane and *tokou paat* ([Trachycarpus
martianus](Trachycarpus_martianus "wikilink")) a large,
[palm](Palm_(plant) "wikilink") leaf. The word *jaapi* derives from
*jaap* meaning a bundle of *taku* leaves. In the past, plain jaapi were
used by ordinary Indians and farmers for protection from the sun, while
ornate jaapi were worn as a status symbol by Assamese royalty and
nobility. Decorative *sorudoi jaapi* are made with intricate cloth
designs (primarily red, white, green, blue, and black) that are
integrated into the weaving.

Japis have been recorded as far back as the time of
[Xuanzang](Xuanzang "wikilink")'s visit to Assam when visitors were
welcomed with colorful jaapi. The [Chutia](Chutia_people "wikilink")
kings(a sub-group of Bodo-Kacharis) are also said to have used Jaapi as
a cultural symbol. The last Chutia king Nitipal had given two gold
embroidered Japis to the Ahom king as gifts in his attempts for a
treaty. Besides this, after annexing Sadiya, the Ahom king received a
lot of treasures and bounty among which included Japis. During the Ahom
rule, *Japi-hajiya Khel*(guild for making Japis) was monopolised by
Chutias, which indicate that they were experts in weaving Japis. It is
also well known that the Chutia brides wore a *Sorudoi Japi* during the
marriage ceremonies which was continued up until recently. Bishnu Prasad
Rabha added Japi dance to Assamese culture through Jaymati movie from
Bodo community's Khomfri Sibnai Mwsanai. Originally Japi was an
agricultural headgear by farmers to protect themselves from rain or
sun's heat. The Bodo-Kacharis having agricultural as the main profession
often used them in the rice fields. Similar headgears are also seen to
be used all throughout East Asia.

Today the jaapi is a symbol of Assam. It is worn in a style of [Bihu
dance](Bihu_dance "wikilink"), used as protection against the elements,
offered as a sign of respect in ceremonies, and placed as a decorative
item around the house, especially near the front door as a welcome sign.
