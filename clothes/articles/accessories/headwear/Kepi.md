*This is about the headgear. For the town in Indonesia, see [Kepi,
Indonesia](Kepi,_Indonesia "wikilink").*

The **kepi** ( ) is a [cap](cap "wikilink") with a flat circular top and
a peak, or [visor](visor "wikilink"). Etymologically, the term is a
[loanword](loanword "wikilink") of a
[French](French_language "wikilink") *kÃ©pi*, itself a re-spelled version
of the [Alemannic](Alemannic_German "wikilink") *KÃ¤ppi*, a diminutive
form of *Kappe*, meaning "cap". In Europe, this headgear is most
commonly associated with French military and police uniforms, though
versions of it were widely worn by other armies during the late 19th and
early 20th centuries. In North America, it is usually associated with
the [American Civil War](American_Civil_War "wikilink"), as it was worn
by soldiers on both sides of the conflict.

## French army â€“ history

`wearingÂ aÂ kepiÂ c.1880]]`

The kepi was formerly the most common headgear in the [French
Army](French_Army "wikilink"). Its predecessor originally appeared
during the 1830s, in the course of the initial stages of the occupation
of Algeria, as a series of various lightweight cane-framed cloth undress
caps called *[casquette d'Afrique](casquette_d'Afrique "wikilink")*.
These were intended as alternatives to the heavier, cloth-covered
leather French Army [shako](shako "wikilink"). As a light and
comfortable headdress, it was adopted by the metropolitan (French
mainland) infantry regiments for service and daily wear, with the less
practical shako being relegated to parade use. In 1852, a new soft cloth
cap was introduced for campaign and off-duty. Called *bonnet de police Ã
visiÃ¨re*, this was the first proper model of the kepi. The visor was
generally squarish in shape and oversized and was referred to as *bec de
canard* (duck bill). This kepi had no chinstrap (*jugulaire*).
Subsequent designs reduced the size of the cap and introduced chinstraps
and buttons. The kepi became well known outside France during the
[Crimean War](Crimean_War "wikilink") and was subsequently adopted in
various forms by a number of other armies (including the U.S. and
Russian) during the 1860s and 1870s.

In 1870, when troops were mobilized for the [Franco-Prussian
War](Franco-Prussian_War "wikilink"), large numbers of French soldiers
either refused to wear the issued [shakos](shako "wikilink") or threw
them away. Emperor NapolÃ©on III abolished the infantry shako for active
service and replaced it with the kepi on 30 July 1870.

In 1876, a new model appeared with a rounded visor, as the squared visor
drooped when wet and curled when drying. The model used in [World
WarÂ I](World_War_I "wikilink") was the 1886 pattern, which was a fuller
shape incorporating air vents. Described as "a ideal headdress - which
was cheap, distinctive and easy to produce", the M1886 kepi's only
significant drawback was that the sunken crown collected rain.

By 1900, the kepi had become the standard headdress of most French army
units and (along with the red trousers of the period 1829â€“1914) a symbol
of the French soldier. It appeared in full dress (with inner stiffening
and ornamental plume or ball ornament) and service versions. Officers'
ranks were shown by gold or silver [braiding](braiding "wikilink") on
the kepi. The different branches were distinguished by the colours of
the cap â€“ see the table. Cavalry normally wore shakos or plumed helmets,
reserving red kepis with light or dark blue bands for wear in barracks.
General officers wore (and continue to wear for ceremonial purposes)
kepis with gold oak leaves embroidered around the band.

In 1914, most French soldiers wore their kepis to war. The highly
visible colours were hidden by a medium blue-grey cover, following the
example of the [Foreign Legion](French_Foreign_Legion "wikilink") and
other North African units who had long worn their kepis with white (or
later khaki) covers in the field. With the adoption of "horizon blue"
(light blue-grey) uniforms and steel [Adrian
helmets](Adrian_helmet "wikilink") in 1915 to replace the conspicuous
peacetime uniforms worn during the early months of war, the kepi was
generally replaced by folding [forage caps](forage_cap "wikilink").
Officers, however, still wore kepis behind the lines.

Following the war, the kepi was gradually reintroduced in the peacetime
French Army, but was never adopted for wear in the Navy or Air Force.
The Foreign Legion resumed wearing it in 1926; initially in red and
blue, and then in 1939, with white covers on all occasions. The bulk of
the French army readopted the kepi in the various traditional branch
colours for off-duty wear during the 1930s. It had now become a
straight-sided and higher headdress than the traditional soft cap. This
made it unsuitable for wartime wear, and after 1940, it was seldom worn,
except by officers. An exception was the Foreign Legion, who, previously
just one of the many units that wore the kepi, now adopted it in its
white version as a symbol.

## Modern French usage

### Army

The decision following the 1991 Gulf War to end conscription in France
and to rely on voluntary enlistment has led to the readoption of various
traditional items for dress wear. This has included the reappearance in
the army of the kepi which is now worn by all ranks in the majority of
units, on appropriate occasions. Within the army, particularly notable
are the kepis of the [French Foreign
Legion](French_Foreign_Legion "wikilink"), whose members are sometimes
called *KÃ©pis blancs* (white kepis), because of the unit's regulation
white headgear. Former cavalry units wear light blue kepis with red tops
and silver braid (for officers) and insignia. Other colours include all
dark blue with red piping (for artillery units), dark blue with red tops
(line infantry) and crimson with red tops (medical). The "dark blue" of
officers' kepis is actually very similar to black.

### Other organizations

The [French National Police](French_National_Police "wikilink")
discarded their dark blue kepis in 1982, adopting a low [peaked
cap](peaked_cap "wikilink"). The reason given was that the rigid kepi,
while smart and distinctive, was inconvenient for ordinary use and too
high to be comfortably worn in vehicles.

French customs officers (*douaniers*) and the
[Gendarmerie](French_Gendarmerie "wikilink") still wear kepis for
ceremonial duty. Customs officers wear a baseball style cap for ordinary
duties (since 1994 with many variations) while the Gendarmerie
introduced a "soft kepi" in the early 2000s.

In the [United States](United_States "wikilink"), the kepi is most often
associated with the [American Civil War](American_Civil_War "wikilink")
era, and continued into the [Indian Wars](Indian_Wars "wikilink"). Union
Officers were generally issued kepis for fatigue use. A close copy of
the contemporary French kepi, it had a sunken top and squared visor. It
was often called a "McClellan cap", after the
[Union](Union_Army "wikilink") commander of the [Army of the
Potomac](Army_of_the_Potomac "wikilink"), [G.B.
McClellan](George_B._McClellan "wikilink"). For field officers, the caps
were often decorated in a French-influenced style, with a dark velvet
band around the base and black silk braiding on the crown. The kepi was
also popular with various state units and as privately purchased
headgear; e.g., it was standard issue in 1861 for New York infantry
regiments.

The kepi is not to be confused with the [model
1858](M1858_uniform "wikilink") [forage cap](forage_cap "wikilink"),
sometimes called a "bummer cap" or McDowell cap, which evolved directly
from the [shako](shako "wikilink") used by the regular army earlier in
the 1850s (see the design of the crown, chinstrap, brim, and
buckle).[1](http://www.dirtybillyshats.com/US21.htm.html) Essentially,
the forage cap, described by some troops as "shapeless as a
[feedbag](feedbag "wikilink")", was a less-expensive and more
comfortable version of the earlier shako with the stiffening
removed.[2](http://www.dirtybillyshats.com/federal_forage_caps.htm.html)
The forage cap became the most common form of cap worn by U.S. regulars
and volunteers during the American Civil War, though it is most commonly
associated with the eastern theater of the war, since western troops
generally preferred broad-brimmed felt hats (see photos of Sherman's
army parading through Washington D.C. at war's end). The forage cap
appears in films such as
*[Gettysburg](Gettysburg_(1993_film) "wikilink")*, *[Gods and
Generals](Gods_and_Generals_(film) "wikilink")*, and
*[Glory](Glory_(1989_film) "wikilink")*. Some Union units wore coloured
variants, as some illustrative examples show:

-   14th [New York](New_York_(state) "wikilink") (from
    [Brooklyn](Brooklyn "wikilink")) â€“ dark blue base, red sides, dark
    blue top, red circular insert
-   12th [New York](New_York_(state) "wikilink") â€“ red base, grey sides,
    red top, white piping and later â€“ dark blue base, light blue top and
    sides, white piping
-   11th [Indiana](Indiana "wikilink") â€“ all red cap
-   [United States Cavalry](United_States_Cavalry "wikilink") - Dark
    blue with a yellow base.
-   [U.S.
    Sharpshooters](Marksman#U.S._Civil_War.281861-1865.29 "wikilink") â€“
    dark green (also used forage caps)

While some [Confederate](Confederate_States_of_America "wikilink")
troops wore the forage cap (Confederate General [Thomas J. "Stonewall"
Jackson](Thomas_J._"Stonewall"_Jackson "wikilink") wore the plain dark
blue round-visored forage cap from his days as an instructor at the
[Virginia Military Institute](Virginia_Military_Institute "wikilink")),
Confederate uniform regulations specified a French-style kepi. These
were to be trimmed as follows:

-   [Confederate](Confederate_States_of_America "wikilink") Regulars:
    -   1st pattern
        -   [Infantry](Infantry "wikilink") â€“ light blue base, grey
            sides and top
        -   [Cavalry](Cavalry "wikilink") â€“ yellow base, grey sides and
            top
        -   [Artillery](Artillery "wikilink") â€“ red base, grey sides and
            top
    -   2nd pattern
        -   Infantry â€“ dark blue base, light blue sides and top
        -   Cavalry â€“ dark blue base, yellow sides and top
        -   Artillery â€“ dark blue base, red sides and top

The regulations were often ignored because of the scarcity of materials
and the need for rapid production. The average Confederate kepi usually
was a simple gray or butternut cap made of wool or jean wool. To save
leather for shoes and accoutrements, by mid-war Confederate kepi brims
often were made of tarred cloth; chinstraps were sometimes omitted.
[3](http://www.civilwarpreservation.com/articleIII.html)[4](http://www.dirtybillyshats.com/confederate_kepis.htm.html)
Many Confederate units wore unique versions of the kepi. These included:

-   Winchester [Zouave](Zouave "wikilink") [Cadets](Cadets "wikilink")
    (of [South Carolina](South_Carolina "wikilink")) â€“ all red
-   [Kentucky](Kentucky "wikilink") Brigade cavalry â€“ all yellow
-   Alexandria Rifles (of [Virginia](Virginia "wikilink")) â€“ dark green

After the war the U.S. Army issued a series of kepi undress caps,
characterised by their increasing smartness and decreasing practicality.
The last model was issued in 1896. When the United States introduced a
revised blue dress uniform in 1902, the kepi was discontinued in favour
of a conventional visor cap with wide top and a steep visor.

The US Army's and Air Force's current [patrol
cap](patrol_cap "wikilink"), the standard covers in utility uniforms
(the [ACU](Army_Combat_Uniform "wikilink") and
[ABU](Airman_Battle_Uniform "wikilink"), respectively), is a variation
of the flat-topped, visored kepi. Its modern lineage can be traced to
[World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), and during the Cold War period
was "blocked" with heavy starching and ironing (referred to as a
"Ridgeway cap"). It was replaced with a baseball-style cap during the
[Vietnam War](Vietnam_War "wikilink"). The present-day patrol cap was
introduced in the 1980s with the transition to the [M81 BDU
uniforms](Battle_Dress_Uniform "wikilink"), and was retained when the
Army adopted the [UCP](Universal_Camouflage_Pattern "wikilink")
digital-pattern camouflage uniforms in 2005, and Air Force's adoption of
the ABU in 2007.

## South America

During the [Paraguayan War](Paraguayan_War "wikilink") between
[Brazil](Empire_of_Brazil "wikilink"),
[Argentina](Argentina "wikilink"), and [Uruguay](Uruguay "wikilink")
versus [Paraguay](Paraguay "wikilink") â€” the Brazilian, Argentine, and
Uruguayan troops and officers primarily wore kepis, though many
Brazilian troops wore brimmed hats, and Uruguayan and Argentine light
infantry wore shakos. The Paraguayans mostly wore leather shakos, but
senior officers were given kepis. Leather kepis were however issued as a
[forage cap](forage_cap "wikilink") to Paraguayan troops, and because of
poor supply standards, were often seen in combat.

With the exception noted below, the Chilean Army no longer wears kepis,
but during the [War of the Pacific](War_of_the_Pacific "wikilink"), it
was part of the standard army uniform. Similarly, the kepi is no longer
worn by the modern Peruvian armed forces and police, but was part of the
uniforms worn during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Today, the following ceremonial units in both countries still use the
kepi:

-   in Chile, the 4th Company of the 7th Reinforced Regiment "Chacabuco"
    and the 1st Historical Company of the 4th Mechanized Infantry
    Brigade "Rancagua";
-   in Peru, the *Fanning Marine Company* of the [Peruvian
    Navy](Peruvian_Navy "wikilink"); and the [National Police of
    Peru](National_Police_of_Peru "wikilink")'s *Guards Inspector
    Mariano Santos Company*. Both retain the [War of the
    Pacific](War_of_the_Pacific "wikilink") uniforms, respectively, of
    the Peruvian Navy and the Civil Guards of Peru. A [Peruvian
    Army](Peruvian_Army "wikilink") company has recently adopted the
    kepi and white uniforms worn by the 2nd Infantry Battalion "Zepita"
    â€” a style used during the War of the Pacific â€” for public parades.
-   Bolivia's 1st Infantry Regiment "Colorados" and the 2nd and 3rd
    Infantry Regiments of the [Bolivian Army](Bolivian_Army "wikilink")
    also wear the kepi as part of their full dress uniforms on major
    ceremonial occasions.

The [Argentine National
Gendarmerie](Argentine_National_Gendarmerie "wikilink") (GendarmerÃ­a
Nacional Argentina; GNA) members wears a green kepi as part of fatigue
and full dress uniforms.

## Military/police usage elsewhere

The practical nature and relative cheapness of the kepi made it a
popular military headdress from the mid-nineteenth century on. Many
Latin American armies wore kepis in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries which were close copies of the French model. Other armies that
favoured kepis during the final period of colourful uniforms that ended
with World War I included the Danish, Portuguese, Dutch, Italian
(officers only), and Romanian armies. Even the Japanese Army adopted
French-style kepis for senior officers in full dress, as well as for
their Gendarmerie units and military bands. Significantly such historic
opponents of France as Germany and Britain, avoided the use of kepis,
with only a few short-lived exceptions, such as for service in India
during the 1850s-60s. During this time the Albert
[Shako](Shako "wikilink") was preferred. This may have been for
practical rather than patriotic reasons, as the distinctive profile of
the kepi would be likely to lead to confusion in battle.

### Belgium

Influenced by France's adoption of the kepi, Belgium introduced it in
1845 as a [forage cap](forage_cap "wikilink") for infantry other ranks.
This headdress was worn until 1868 when a new model without a vizor was
adopted. Officers of infantry and cavalry regiments wore their own
version of the kepi from 1859 until the First World War. It was modified
several times over the decades, the last version being the 1900/1910
model. By that time it had evolved into a comparatively tall cylinder
with the national emblem at the front and a cross-shaped [Austrian
knot](Austrian_knot "wikilink") on the crown. The wearer's rank was
indicated by a system of horizontal and vertical bands of gold or silver
braid. The kepi was also worn by officers of the General Staff.

In September 1914 the wide range of peacetime headdresses
([shakos](shako "wikilink"),
[busbies](Busby_(military_headdress) "wikilink"), "Corsican" caps,
[czapkas](czapka "wikilink") and [bearskins](bearskin "wikilink")) still
being worn by the Belgian Army, were replaced by the universal "Yser"
kepi. This consisted of a dark blue or green soft cap with folding
double flaps. With the adoption of a British-style khaki uniform from
1915, the kepi was abandoned in favour of the [peaked
cap](peaked_cap "wikilink") for all ranks, with the exception of the
paramilitary [*Gendarmerie*](Gendarmerie_(Belgium) "wikilink"), who
continued to wear the kepi as part of their parade dress until the
1960s.

### Denmark

Used by all soldiers of the Danish army until [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink"), it is now only retained as part of the
[full dress](Uniforms_of_the_Royal_Danish_Army#Dress_Uniform "wikilink")
uniforms for officers.

### Greece

Until the early 20th century the Greek Army wore dark blue or green (the
latter for cavalry) kepis, and continued the same style of headress in
khaki when field uniforms of that colour were introduced in 1910.
Officer cadets and NCO trainees still wear kepis as part of the full
dress uniforms of their respective military academies.

### India

In [India](India "wikilink"), during the French colonial rule of
[Pondicherry](Pondicherry_district "wikilink"),
[Yanam](Yanam,_French_India "wikilink"), [Karaikal](Karaikal "wikilink")
and [MahÃ©](MahÃ©,_India "wikilink"), Kepis were worn by two kinds of
policemen, the Armed and the Indigenous, differentiated by the colour of
the kepis they wore. While the law and order forces wore bright red
caps, the armed constabulary was conspicuous by its blue kepis. After
Indian Independence, the former French colonial territory was integrated
into the Union Territory of [Puducherry](Puducherry "wikilink") and the
bright red kepi continues to be the headgear of the constabulary â€” both
for the local and the armed police signifying the cultural and
administrative legacies left by the former colonialists.

### Iran

In Iran this kind of headdress was known as the "[Pahlavi
hat](Pahlavi_hat "wikilink")" (kolah pahlavi, Ú©Ù„Ø§Ù‡ Ù¾Ù‡Ù„ÙˆÛŒ). Only worn for
a brief period, from 1927 until the 1930s, it was generally of a grey
color.

### Latvia

In modern ceremonial dress the [Latvian National Armed Forces Staff
Battalion](Latvian_National_Armed_Forces_Staff_Battalion "wikilink") and
Staff Orchestra both wear backward sloping kepis of the style worn by
the Belgian Army immediately prior to World War I.

### Luxembourg

Kepis with a slightly higher back were formerly worn by the
***[Luxembourg Army](Luxembourg_Army "wikilink")*** until 1945. Since
World War II they were replaced by British Army-style peak caps.

The same kepis with higher back were also worn by the former *[Grand
Ducal Gendarmerie](Grand_Ducal_Gendarmerie_(Luxembourg) "wikilink")* in
a blue version corresponding to the colour of their uniforms.

The kepi is still used by the newly created ***[Grand Ducal
Police](Grand_Ducal_Police "wikilink")*** which replaced the Gendarmerie
and the local police forces in 2000.

### Nazi Germany

The brown stiff kÃ©pi (*SchaftmÃ¼tze*) of Hitler's
[Brownshirt](Brownshirt "wikilink")
[Stormtroopers](Sturmabteilung "wikilink") (SA, **S**turm**a**bteilung)
and its black version initially worn by the members of the SS (before it
was replaced by a peaked cap) were derived from surplus Austrian
equipment.

### Northern Ireland

A form of kepi is worn by female officers in the modern [Police Service
of Northern Ireland](Police_Service_of_Northern_Ireland "wikilink").

### Norway

The [Norwegian](Norway "wikilink") armed forces used kepis until [World
War II](World_War_II "wikilink") and still retain them as part of the
full dress of officer cadets.

### Spain

In [Spain](Spain "wikilink"), a version of the kepi (actually a low
[shako](shako "wikilink")), the *ros*, is used by the *Guardia Real*
([Royal Guard](Spanish_Royal_Guard "wikilink")) and the *[Regimiento de
InfanterÃ­a Inmemorial del
Rey](1st_King's_Immemorial_Infantry_Regiment "wikilink")* for ceremonial
functions. The Spanish 1887 regulation kepi or
[Teresiana](Teresiana "wikilink") was made of black oilcloth with a
tortoise shell visor. A plainer form of kepi was retained by the [Civil
Guard](Civil_Guard_(Spain) "wikilink") as its non-ceremonial headdress
for normal police duties, until it was abolished under the 2011 revised
regulations and replaced by a baseball cap.

### Sweden

In [Sweden](Sweden "wikilink"), the kepi has been used with several
uniform types. The most common was the grey kepi worn as part of the
M1923 field uniform and the dark blue kepi worn as part of the uniform
types m/1886 and m/1895, and still in use by the Life Guards.

### Switzerland

In [Switzerland](Switzerland "wikilink"), the kepi was worn as a part of
the dress uniforms of senior NCOs (Sergeant major and above) and
officers (with additional rank insignia) until the 1995 army reform
([Swiss Armed Forces](Swiss_Armed_Forces "wikilink")). Since then, it is
only worn by senior staff officers (Brigadier general and higher).

### Thailand

In [Thailand](Thailand "wikilink"), the kepi has been using with study
uniform and casual uniform of police cadets at the Thai Royal Police
Cadet Academy (RPCA).

## Non-military use

`passengerÂ trainÂ inÂ theÂ UnitedÂ States]]`

Kepis also found their way into the uniforms of numerous
[railway](railway "wikilink") and [streetcar](streetcar "wikilink")
operators in the United States. From there it was adopted by other
public transport operators around the world, including the examples
given below:

-   in [Brisbane](Brisbane "wikilink"),
    [Australia](Australia "wikilink") drivers and conductors continued
    to wear distinctive white kepis with black visors until 1961.
    Brisbane bus inspectors continued to wear black kepis with
    decorative braid until the introduction of a blue version in 1987.
    [Brisbane Transport](Brisbane_Transport "wikilink") finally replaced
    inspector's kepis in 1995, although as of 2006 they could still be
    worn at official functions.
-   [Belgian Railways](National_Railway_Company_of_Belgium "wikilink")
    conductors (but not train drivers or other personnel) wear a kepi as
    part of their daily uniform.
-   a form of kepi modeled on the Austrian ski-cap, was the standard
    headgear of uniformed [British Rail](British_Rail "wikilink") male
    employees from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s.
-   A round peak-less cap with an outline resemblance to a kepi is also
    worn by traditional student fraternities, also called
    [Studentenverbindung](Studentenverbindung "wikilink"), in
    [Germany](Germany "wikilink"), [Austria](Austria "wikilink"),
    [Switzerland](Switzerland "wikilink") and
    [Belgium](Belgium "wikilink"). They come in different
    [varieties](Couleur "wikilink") and are very colorful in appearance.
-   In the United States, the [Nation of
    Islam](Nation_of_Islam "wikilink")'s security/executive protection
    force, the [Fruit of Islam](Fruit_of_Islam "wikilink"), also wears a
    dark blue version of the kepi.
