\]\] A **kippah** ( ; also spelled as **kippa**, **kipa**, **kipah**; ,
plural: *kippot*; *koppel*, or ,}} , ), is a brimless
[cap](cap "wikilink"), usually made of cloth, traditionally worn by
[Jewish](Jew "wikilink") males to fulfill the customary requirement that
the head be covered. It is worn by men in
[Orthodox](Orthodox_Judaism "wikilink") communities at all times. Among
non-Orthodox communities most people who wear them customarily do so
only during prayer or other rituals, including some women. Most
[synagogues](synagogue "wikilink") and Jewish funeral services keep a
ready supply of *kippot*.

## Etymology

The term *kippah* ( ) literally means "dome", as the kippa is worn on
the head like a dome. The [Yiddish](Yiddish "wikilink") term *yarmulke*
might be derived from Ukrainian or Polish *jarmulka*, although it is
often associated with an [Aramaic](Aramaic_language "wikilink") phrase
(ירא מלכא) meaning "fear the King". Another suggested etymology of
*yarmulke* is the Latin word for an ecclesiastical hood worn in the
medieval church.

*Keppel* or *koppel* is another Yiddish term for the same thing.

## Jewish law

There is debate among [Halachic](halakha "wikilink") authorities as to
whether wearing a kippah at all times is required. According to the
[Rambam](Maimonides "wikilink"), Jewish law dictates that a man is
required to cover his head during prayer.

However, according to some authorities, it has since taken on the force
of law because it is an act of [Kiddush
Hashem](Kiddush_Hashem "wikilink") (lit., "sanctification of [the
Name](Names_of_God_in_Judaism "wikilink")", referring to actions which
bring honor to God). The 17th-century authority Rabbi [David HaLevi
Segal](David_HaLevi_Segal "wikilink") (The "Taz") suggested that the
reason was to distinguish Jews from their non-Jewish counterparts,
especially while at prayer. He held that nowadays, wearing a kippah is
required by [halacha](Halakha "wikilink").

Other halachic authorities like Sephardi posek, the
[Chida](Chaim_Joseph_David_Azulai "wikilink") (Rabbi Chaim David Yosef
Azulai), hold that wearing a head covering is a *midat hasidut*, an
additional measure of piety. In a recent responsum, former Sephardic
Chief Rabbi of Israel [Ovadia Yosef](Ovadia_Yosef "wikilink") ruled that
it should be worn to show affiliation with the religiously observant
community.

The [Talmud](Talmud "wikilink") states, "Cover your head in order that
the fear of heaven may be upon you." Rabbi Hunah ben Joshua never walked
4 [cubits](cubits "wikilink") (6.6 feet, or 2 meters) with his head
uncovered. He explained: "Because the [Divine
Presence](Shekhinah "wikilink") is always over my head." This was
understood by Rabbi Yosef Karo in the [Shulchan
Arukh](Shulchan_Arukh "wikilink") as indicating that Jewish men should
cover their heads, and should not walk more than four cubits bareheaded.
Covering one's head, such as by wearing a kippah, is described as
"honoring God". The *[Mishnah Berurah](Mishnah_Berurah "wikilink")*
modifies this ruling, adding that the *[Achronim](Achronim "wikilink")*
established a requirement to wear a head covering even when traversing
fewer than four cubits, and even when one is standing still, indoors and
outside. *[Kitzur Shulchan
Aruch](Shlomo_Ganzfried#Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch "wikilink")* cites a story
from the Talmud (Shabbat 156b) about [Rav Nachman bar
Yitzchak](Rav_Nachman_bar_Yitzchak "wikilink"), who might have become a
thief had his mother not saved him from this fate by insisting that he
cover his head, which instilled in him the fear of God. In Orthodox
communities, boys are encouraged to wear a *kippah* from a young age in
order to ingrain the habit.

`soldier prays with kippah and `[`tefillin`](tefillin "wikilink")`.]]`

The Talmud also implies that unmarried men did not wear a kippah: Rabbi
Hisda praised Rabbi Hamnuna before Rabbi Huna as a great man. He said to
him, 'When he visits you, bring him to me.' When he arrived, he saw that
he wore no head-covering. 'Why do you not have head-covering?', he
asked. 'Because I am not married', was the reply. Thereupon, he \[Rabbi
Huna\] turned his face away from him, and said, 'See to it that you do
not appear before me again before you are married.' \[Tractate Kiddushin
29b\]

The Tanakh implies that covering one's head is a sign of mourning:

`}}`
`}}The argument for the kippa has two sides. The `[`Vilna`` ``Gaon`](Vilna_Gaon "wikilink")` said one can make a `*[`berakhah`](berakhah "wikilink")*` without a kippah, since wearing a kippah is only an `*`midos`` ``chassidus`*` ("exemplary attribute"). Recently, there has been an effort to suppress earlier sources that practiced this leniency, including erasing lenient `[`responsa`](responsa "wikilink")` from newly published books.`

According to Rabbi [Isaac Klein](Isaac_Klein "wikilink"), a Conservative
Jew ought to cover his head when in the synagogue, at prayer or sacred
study, when engaging in a ritual act, and when eating. In the mid-19th
century, Reformers led by [Isaac Wise](Isaac_Mayer_Wise "wikilink")
completely rejected the *kippot* after an altercation in which Rabbi
Wise's kippah was knocked off his head.

There is still debate about whether wearing a Kippah is Halachic law or
simply a custom. Many Sephardic Jews wear a kippah only when praying and
eating.

## Types and variation

`with fellow U.S. Airmen wearing `[`camouflage`](camouflage "wikilink")` kippot.]]`

In the [Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink") in Europe, the distinctive
Jewish headgear was the [Jewish hat](Jewish_hat "wikilink"), a full hat
with a brim and a central point or stalk. Originally used by choice
among Jews to distinguish themselves, it was later made compulsory in
some places by Christian governments as a discriminatory measure. In the
early 19th century in the United States, rabbis often wore a scholar's
cap (large saucer-shaped caps of cloth, like a beret) or a Chinese
skullcap. Other Jews of this era wore black pillbox-shaped *kippot*.

Often, the color and fabric of the *kippah* can be a sign of adherence
to a specific religious movement, particularly in Israel.
[Knitted](Knit "wikilink") or [crocheted](crochet "wikilink") *kippot*,
known as *kippot serugot*, are usually worn by [Religious
Zionists](Religious_Zionist_movement "wikilink") and the [Modern
Orthodox](Modern_Orthodox_Judaism "wikilink"), who also wear suede or
leather *kippot*. Members of most [Haredi](Haredi_Judaism "wikilink")
groups wear black velvet or cloth *kippot*.

More recently, *kippot* have been observed made in the colors of sports
teams, especially [football](football "wikilink"). In the United States,
children's *kippot* with cartoon characters or themes such as *[Star
Wars](Star_Wars "wikilink")* are popular. (In response to this trend,
some Jewish schools have banned *kippot* with characters that do not
conform to traditional Jewish values. ) *Kippot* have been inscribed on
the inside as a souvenir for a celebration (*bar/bat mitzvah* or
wedding). *Kippot* for women are also being made and worn. These are
sometimes made of beaded wire to seem more feminine. A special baby
kippah has two strings on each side to fasten it and is often used in a
*[brit milah](brit_milah "wikilink")* ceremony.

[Samaritans](Samaritan "wikilink") once wore distinctive blue head
coverings to separate them from Jews who wore white ones, but today,
they more commonly wear *[fezes](Fez_(hat) "wikilink")* with turbans
similar to that of [Sephardi Jews](Sephardi_Jews "wikilink") from the
Middle East and North Africa. Today, Samaritans do not usually wear head
coverings, except during prayer, Sabbath, and religious festivals.

## Head coverings in ancient Israelite culture

The [Israelites](Israelites "wikilink") on
[Sennacherib](Sennacherib "wikilink")'s marble relief appear with
headdress, and although the ambassadors of [Jehu](Jehu "wikilink") on
the [Shalmaneser stele](Black_Obelisk_of_Shalmaneser_III "wikilink")
have head coverings, their costume seems to be Israelite. One passage of
the older literature is of significance: I Kings 20:31 mentions חֲבָליִם
*havalim*, which are placed around the head. This calls to mind pictures
of [Syrians](Demographics_of_Syria "wikilink") on
[Egyptian](Egypt "wikilink") monuments, represented wearing a cord
around their long, flowing hair, a custom still followed in
[Arabia](Arabia "wikilink").

Evidently the costume of the poorest classes is represented; but as the
cord gave no protection against the heat of the sun, there is little
probability that the custom lasted very long. Much more common was the
simple cloth skullcap, dating back to Egyptian times when those of high
society routinely shaved their heads, to prevent lice. Conversely, their
skullcaps also served as protection against irritation from their wigs.

The Israelites might have worn a headdress similar to that worn by the
[Bedouins](Bedouins "wikilink"), but it is unknown whether a fixed type
of headdress was utilized. That the headdress of the Israelites might
have been in the fellah style may be inferred from the use of the noun
צַנִיף *tzanif* (the verb *tzanaf* meaning "to roll like a ball", Isaiah
22:18) and by the verb חַבָּש *habash* ("to wind", comp. Ezekiel 16:10;
Jonah 2:6). As to the form of such turbans, nothing is known, and they
may have varied according to the different classes of society. This was
customary with the Assyrians and Babylonians, for example, whose
fashions likely influenced the costume of the Israelites—particularly
during and after the [Babylonian
Exile](Babylonian_captivity "wikilink"). In Yemen, the wrap around the
cap was called מַצַר *matzar*; the head covering worn by women was a
גַּרגוּש *[gargush](gargush "wikilink")*.

## Civil legal issues

In *[Goldman v. Weinberger](Goldman_v._Weinberger "wikilink")*, 475 U.S.
503 (1986), the [United States Supreme
Court](United_States_Supreme_Court "wikilink") ruled in a 5–4 decision
that active military members were required to remove the yarmulke
indoors, citing uniform regulations that state only armed security
police may keep their heads covered while indoors.

Congress passed the Religious Apparel Amendment after a war story from
the [1983 Beirut barracks
bombing](1983_Beirut_barracks_bombing "wikilink") about the "camouflage
kippah" of Jewish Navy Chaplain [Arnold
Resnicoff](Arnold_Resnicoff "wikilink") was read into the *Congressional
Record*. Catholic Chaplain George Pucciarelli tore off a piece of his
[Marine Corps](Marine_Corps "wikilink") uniform to replace Resnicoff's
*kippah* when it had become blood-soaked after being used to wipe the
faces of wounded Marines after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing. This
amendment was eventually incorporated into U.S. Department of Defense
(DOD) regulations on the "Accommodation of Religious Practices Within
the Military Services".

`wearing a kippah to visit the grave of `[`Yitzhak`` ``Rabin`](Yitzhak_Rabin "wikilink")` on `[`Mount`` ``Herzl`](Mount_Herzl "wikilink")`.]]`

This story of the "camouflage kippah" was re-told at many levels,
including a keynote speech by President [Ronald
Reagan](Ronald_Reagan "wikilink") to the Baptist Fundamentalism Annual
Convention in 1984, and another time during a [White
House](White_House "wikilink") meeting between Reagan and the American
Friends of Lubavitch. After recounting the Beirut story, Reagan asked
them about the religious meaning of the kippah.

Passage of the Religious Apparel Amendment and the subsequent DOD
regulations were followed in 1997 by the passing of the [Religious
Freedom Restoration Act](Religious_Freedom_Restoration_Act "wikilink")
(RFRA). However, the Supreme Court struck down RFRA as beyond Congress'
powers to bind the states in the 1997 case *[City of Boerne v.
Flores](City_of_Boerne_v._Flores "wikilink")*. RFRA is constitutional as
applied to the Federal government, as seen in *[Gonzales v. O Centro
Espirita Beneficente Uniao do
Vegetal](Gonzales_v._O_Centro_Espirita_Beneficente_Uniao_do_Vegetal "wikilink")*.

The [Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons
Act](Religious_Land_Use_and_Institutionalized_Persons_Act "wikilink") of
2000 (RLUIPA), 114 Stat. 804, 42 U. S. C. §2000cc-1(a)(1)-(2), upheld as
constitutional in *[Cutter v.
Wilkinson](Cutter_v._Wilkinson "wikilink")*, 44 U.S. 709 (2005),
requires by inference that Orthodox Jewish prisoners be reasonably
accommodated in their request to wear yarmulkas.

The French government [banned the
wearing](French_law_on_secularity_and_conspicuous_religious_symbols_in_schools "wikilink")
of *kippot*, *[hijabs](hijab "wikilink")*, and large
[crosses](Christian_cross "wikilink") in public primary and secondary
schools in France in March 2004.

The provincial government of [Quebec](Quebec "wikilink"), Canada passed
"An Act respecting the laicity of the State" in June 2019, which
prohibits the wearing of "religious symbols" by government employees
including teachers, police officers, judges, prosecutors, and members of
certain commissions.

## Wearing by non-Jews

It is considered a sign of respect for anyone in a synagogue to wear a
kippah. Yarmulkes are often provided to guests at a [Bar or Bat
Mitzvah](Bar_or_Bat_Mitzvah "wikilink"). They are also often provided at
[bereavement](Bereavement_in_Judaism "wikilink") events and at [Jewish
cemeteries](Jewish_cemetery "wikilink"). According to the Conservative
[Committee on Jewish Law and
Standards](Committee_on_Jewish_Law_and_Standards "wikilink"), there is
no [halakhic](halakhic "wikilink") reason to require a non-Jew to cover
their head, but it is recommended that non-Jews be asked to wear a
kippah where ritual or worship is being conducted out of respect for the
Jewish congregation as well as out of respect for the non-Jew.

Kippahs were adopted as a symbol by some of the non-Jewish African
American marchers in the 1965 [Selma to Montgomery
