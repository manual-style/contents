A **kufi** or **kufi cap** is a brimless, short, and rounded
[cap](cap "wikilink") worn by men in many populations in [North
Africa](North_Africa "wikilink"), [East Africa](East_Africa "wikilink"),
[Western Africa](Western_Africa "wikilink") and [South
Asia](South_Asia "wikilink"). It is also worn by men throughout the
[African diaspora](African_diaspora "wikilink"). It is also commonly
called a "topi" or "tupi" among the [Indian
subcontinent](Indian_subcontinent "wikilink").

## African and African-American usage

In [West Africa](West_Africa "wikilink"), a kufi cap is the traditional
hat for men, and is part of the [national
costume](national_costume "wikilink") of most of the countries in the
region. It is worn by [Muslims](Muslim "wikilink"), and
[African](African_people "wikilink")
[Christians](Christians "wikilink"). Many grandfathers and other older
men wear a kufi every day to symbolize their status as wise elders,
religious people, or family patriarchs.

Within the [United States](United_States "wikilink"), it has become
identified primarily with persons of West African heritage, who wear it
to show pride in their culture, history, and religion (whether
[Christianity](Christianity "wikilink"), [Islam](Islam "wikilink"), or
[Traditional African
religions](Traditional_African_religion "wikilink")). Often made of
[kente cloth](kente_cloth "wikilink"), [mudcloth](mudcloth "wikilink"),
or [knitted](knitted "wikilink") or [crocheted](crocheted "wikilink") in
a variety of yarns.

Crown style kufis are the traditional hat worn with formal West African
attire, see [Dashiki](Dashiki "wikilink"). A formal dashiki suit will
always include a crown style kufi, while the knitted style is most
appropriate for non-formal occasions. Other caps worn with the Dashiki,
[Senegalese kaftan](Senegalese_kaftan "wikilink"), and [Grand
boubou](Boubou_(clothing) "wikilink"), include:

-   The [Aso Oke hat](Aso_Oke_hat "wikilink"), from
    [Nigeria](Nigeria "wikilink")
-   The [Fez](Fez_(hat) "wikilink"), a wool cap with a stem from, [North
    Africa](North_Africa "wikilink"), also called a *tarboush*
-   The Abeti-aja, a triangular [Yoruba](Yoruba_people "wikilink") hat,
    whose name means, *like the ears of a dog,* from
    [Nigeria](Nigeria "wikilink")

However, the crown style kufi is most common.

In the [United States](United_States "wikilink") today, many
[African-Americans](African-Americans "wikilink") wear the kufi during
[weddings](wedding "wikilink"), [funerals](funeral "wikilink"),
[graduations](graduations "wikilink") and [Kwanzaa](Kwanzaa "wikilink")
celebrations. Furthermore, people of mainly West African heritage of all
faiths wear the kufi, although it is associated with members of the
[Islamic](Islamic "wikilink") faith more.

A West African king or tribal chief may have royal or noble arms
embroidered on the kufi (see [Heraldry in Sub-Saharan
Africa](Heraldry_in_Sub-Saharan_Africa "wikilink")).

For members of the [Christian](Christianity "wikilink") faith, the kufi
is unisex, and is also worn by women. Crochet and knitted styles are
preferred by young girls and infants.

Traditionally, when worn by men, the kufi is a sign of peace, mourning,
renewal or protection of the mind.

## Etymology

In the [Yoruba language](Yoruba_language "wikilink"), *Ade* means crown,
and *fila* means cap. The city of Kufi is located in
[Yorubaland](Yoruba_people "wikilink") near [Ibadan](Ibadan "wikilink").
Other West African names include *fula*, *fila*, and *malo hat*. This
cap is called a [kofia](Kofia_(hat) "wikilink") in the [Swahili
language](Swahili_language "wikilink") of [East
Africa](East_Africa "wikilink") (see the [kanzu](kanzu "wikilink")
article for further information). In the [United
States](United_States "wikilink"), the West African name, *kufi*, is
most commonly used.
