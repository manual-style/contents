`withÂ montera.]]`

A **montera** is the [hat](hat "wikilink") traditionally worn by many
males and females in the folk costumes of the Iberian peninsula. It has
come to name also but not exclusively the ones used by
[bullfighters](Bullfighting "wikilink"), introduced to the event in 1835
by [Francisco "Paquiro" Montes](Francisco_Montes_Reina "wikilink") as
accompaniment to the *[traje de luces](traje_de_luces "wikilink")*, or
"suit of lights".

The montera is habitually covered in
[astrakhan](Karakul_(sheep)#Karakul_pelts "wikilink")
[fur](fur "wikilink") with an inner lining of
[velvet](velvet "wikilink"). The image of a [saint](saint "wikilink") is
sometimes printed on the lining as a [talisman](talisman "wikilink") of
good luck. The top of the montera is often decorated with a special
design.

The "bulbs" on the sides of the montera represent the horns of a bull.
