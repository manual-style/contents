`sporting a mushroom-brimmed hat in 1918]]`

A **mushroom hat** (also sometimes referred to as a **mushroom brim
hat** or **dish hat**) is a millinery style in which the brim of the hat
tilts downwards, resembling the shape of a mushroom (or dish). It is a
style that first emerged in the 1870s and 1880s, when it was usually
made of straw. It became fashionable again from around 1907 to the late
1920s; these versions featured a distinctly downturned brim although the
size and shape of the crown varied according to prevailing fashions.

A new and exaggerated version of the mushroom hat was popularised by
[Christian Dior](Christian_Dior "wikilink") in 1947 as part of his ["New
Look"](Christian_Dior_S.A.#The_.22New_Look.22 "wikilink") collection.
This style generally had a minimal crown and a very wide brim, with some
models resembling a [flying saucer](flying_saucer "wikilink").

## History of the design

, 1879\]\]

The defining characteristic of mushroom hats is their downturned brim,
resembling a mushroom or toadstool. In the 1870s, designs in straw
shaped like a mushroom became popular. These had a small crown trimmed
with ribbons, flowers and – in the 1880s – bird decorations.

`satirising the popularity of mushroom hats]]`

In 1907, mushroom hats in both straw and felt became popular. Such was
their ubiquity that [Evelyn Sharp](Evelyn_Sharp_(suffragist) "wikilink")
lambasted them in an editorial in *[The
Guardian](The_Guardian "wikilink")*, writing: "For about six months have
we endured the sight of mushroom shapes in every kind of straw trimmed
with a fringed silk scarf. I suppose there was some attraction in the
mushroom hat when it was first designed, and I can still see its charms
when it is very small and very flexible....worn by somebody in a motor
car. But this autumnal growth of felt fungi deserves nothing but
condemnation". Her words fell on deaf ears as the popularity of mushroom
shapes persisted. In 1909, a full-page advertisement in *[The
Times](The_Times "wikilink")* describing [Selfridge &
Co](Selfridges "wikilink")'s millinery choices detailed a mushroom brim
hat decorated with [ostrich
feathers](Ostrich#Hunting_and_farming "wikilink"). In the same year,
[Dickins & Jones](Dickins_&_Jones "wikilink") offered a: "becoming
mushroom hat...trimmed with wide Velvet Ribbon and a Large Posy of
Flowers at side". By 1915, variations on the design for younger girls
included almost brimless mushroom models – similar to a
[cloche](Cloche_hat "wikilink") or [bucket](Bucket_hat "wikilink") hat.

### 1920s variations

, but with the addition of a neat brim, such as this model worn by
[Isabel Rockefeller](Isabel_Rockefeller "wikilink")\]\] The mushroom hat
was fashionable throughout the 1920s, with [Princess
Mary](Mary,_Princess_Royal_and_Countess_of_Harewood "wikilink") choosing
a mushroom shape with a blue lace-covered brim for the opening day of
[Ascot](Ascot_Racecourse "wikilink") in 1920. Five years later, the
[Duchess of York](Queen_Mother "wikilink") chose a mushroom design
trimmed with vivid orange [osprey](osprey "wikilink") feathers tucked at
either side of the brim for Ascot's Ladies' Day race meeting.

It was a style that could incorporate the fashions for snug-fitting
cloche-like designs or taller crowned hats. A fashion editorial of 1921
noted the value of wider-brimmed models: "Plentiful sunshine has served
to emphasize the advantages of a mushroom hat, which with its adequate
protection often makes a sunshade unnecessary". In the same year, velvet
for babies were described as among the newest children's millinery. The
hat design lent itself to ornate decorations with ribbon and feather
trims and veils. It could also be made in a variety of materials, from
straw for summer to felt or stiffened silk for winter; in 1925, [Harvey
Nichols](Harvey_Nichols "wikilink") offered a selection of mushroom hats
for the autumn season in the latest [velour](velour "wikilink") fabric.

## 1940s "New Look" adaptation

A new variety of mushroom hat (also known as the dish hat) appeared at
Dior's first fashion show on 12 February 1947. The hat balanced the neat
jacket with nipped-in waist and full [tulle-lined](Tulle "wikilink")
skirt, heralding a new lavishness in fabric and silhouette – what editor
of American *[Harper's Bazaar](Harper's_Bazaar "wikilink")* [Carmel
Snow](Carmel_Snow "wikilink") described at first viewing as a "new
look".

By 1956, the fashion for new shapes meant a huge variety of options, as
noted by *The Guardian*'s fashion correspondent Phyllis Heathcote:
"Flower-pots, sugar-loaves, mushrooms, melons, muffins – all these have
inspired Paris milliners this season". Of the mushroom look, she added:
"This may be small and snugly rounded, like the little pink 'Champignon
de Paris' (Chabeau makes one of these in fine straw with a goffered
frill of organdy under the brim that somehow carries the model away back
to the source of its inspiration)...or it is wide and gently curving at
the brim like the larger and flatter field variety. On these wider
shapes go flat the airier techniques that the spring hat demands. Laizes
of all kinds; fine picot straws, satin straws, gros-grain, short-pile
summer velvet, raffia, coarse tulle, jersey, printed taffeta, crin,
organdy, chiffon, and a great many flowers". Other names for the
variations that emerged include the mushroom cloche, a diminutive
version of Dior's oversized dish.

Wide-brimmed mushroom hats continued to be popular throughout the 1950s
and early '60s, with other designers incorporating the wide hat profile.
Adaptations included [Balmain's](Pierre_Balmain "wikilink") spring 1955
side-swept mushroom hat – a design in which the downward-curved brim of
the hat dipped low on one side of the face and was tilted upwards on the
other, forming an almost triangular profile.

In 1959, *[The Observer](The_Observer "wikilink")* reported that
mushroom hats were big news at Ascot for milliners such as [Rose
Vernier](Rose_Vernier "wikilink"): "The majority of her clients wanted
big tulle mushrooms, but the younger girls asked for the youthful
tailored shapes of medium size – when they were not demanding outsize
Gigi bretons".

In 1963, [Balenciaga](Cristóbal_Balenciaga "wikilink") included extreme
saucer-shaped versions of the design in velvet, worn with a tapered
[raglan-sleeved](Raglan_sleeve "wikilink") black [wool
crepe](Crêpe_(textile) "wikilink") dress and lime yellow [twill
coat](Twill "wikilink") with pleated shoulder. By 1964, a more
[bucket-shaped](Bucket_hat "wikilink") line had re-emerged.
[Ricci](Nina_Ricci_(designer) "wikilink") showed a high-crowned white
mushroom hat worn with a double-breasted
[gaberdine](gaberdine "wikilink") suit in the spring shows.

### Revivals

The mushroom shape has had a number of revivals in high fashion. During
the mid 1980s, [Frederick Fox](Frederick_Fox_(milliner) "wikilink")
created a much-photographed mushroom-style design for [Diana, Princess
of Wales](Diana,_Princess_of_Wales "wikilink") – worn tilted and known
as the 'flying saucer'. More recently, [Stephen
Jones](Stephen_Jones_(milliner) "wikilink") designed oversized hats in
fur – including mushroom-like designs – for the fall/winter 2012 [Marc
Jacobs](Marc_Jacobs "wikilink")' show at [New York Fashion
Week](New_York_Fashion_Week "wikilink").
