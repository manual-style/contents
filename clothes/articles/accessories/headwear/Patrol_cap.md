A **patrol cap**, also known as a **field cap**, is a soft
[kepi](kepi "wikilink") with a stiff, rounded [visor](visor "wikilink"),
and flat top, somewhat similar to a [baseball
cap](baseball_cap "wikilink"), worn by the military personnel of some
countries in the field when a [combat helmet](combat_helmet "wikilink")
is not required.

## History

### U.S. Military

#### M1951 Field Cap and Ridgeway Cap

The **M1951 Field Cap**, introduced with the M1951 Uniform, was a
derivative of the **M1943 Field Cap**, part of the [M1943
Uniform](M1943_Uniform "wikilink"). It was constructed of wind-resistant
[olive drab](olive_drab "wikilink") cotton [poplin](poplin "wikilink"),
and had a flannel wool panel that folded down to cover the ears and the
back of the head. After the Korean War, the cap was replaced by the
**Ridgeway Cap**, a stiffened version of the M1951. The hat became
famous outside America after being worn by [Fidel
Castro](Fidel_Castro "wikilink"). The patrol cap was replaced altogether
in 1962 with a [baseball](baseball_cap "wikilink")-like "Cap, Field (Hot
Weather)" and during the Vietnam War by the [boonie
hat](boonie_hat "wikilink").

In 1980 the Army introduced the [Battle Dress
Uniform](Battle_Dress_Uniform "wikilink") (BDU) which featured a patrol
cap similar to the M1951 Field Cap, including the wool panel to cover
the ears, except it was in [Woodland
camouflage](M81_Woodland "wikilink"). The BDU was replaced, starting in
2004, with the [Army Combat Uniform](Army_Combat_Uniform "wikilink")
(ACU).

Starting on June 14, 2001, Army Chief of Staff General [Eric
Shinseki](Eric_Shinseki "wikilink") made the black beret the standard
headgear for Soldiers in the garrison environment. On June 14, 2011, the
M1951/ACU soft patrol cap became once again the primary headgear for all
Soldiers as the duty uniform headgear after a 10-year hiatus in favor of
the beret, according to Army Directive 2011-11.

#### BDU, ACU and ABU Patrol Cap

In 1981, following the introduction of the [M81 Battle Dress
Uniform](M81_Battle_Dress_Uniform "wikilink"), the patrol cap was
reintroduced.\] The patrol cap continues to be worn with the [Army
Combat Uniform](Army_Combat_Uniform "wikilink"), introduced in 2004.\]
The materials are 50% [cotton](cotton "wikilink"), 50%
[nylon](nylon "wikilink") blend. The ACU patrol cap featured a Velcro
strip on the back of the cap so a name tag could be attached to the cap.

Patterns have included [M81 Woodland](M81_Woodland "wikilink"), [Six
color desert camouflage](Six_color_desert_camouflage "wikilink"), [Three
color desert camouflage](Three_color_desert_camouflage "wikilink"), and
the [Universal Camouflage
Pattern](Universal_Camouflage_Pattern "wikilink"). The ACU patrol cap
features a [velcro](velcro "wikilink")-backed patch on the back with the
soldier's name printed on it and a small internal pocket, the soldier's
rank insignia is pinned on the front, as seen in the image below. The
patrol cap also comes in a pixelized version of the
[Tigerstripe](Tigerstripe "wikilink") camouflage pattern, worn with the
[United States Air Force](United_States_Air_Force "wikilink")'s [Airman
Battle Uniform](Airman_Battle_Uniform "wikilink"). In late 2010, the US
Army began issuing the [MultiCam](MultiCam "wikilink") pattern for use
in [Afghanistan](Afghanistan "wikilink"). It is now being introduced to
patrol caps and the ACU to provide the best camouflage possible.

### Israel Defense Forces

This style of military uniform cap was worn by the [Muleteers'
Battalion](:he:גדוד_נהגי_הפרדות_(צה"ל) "wikilink") founded in January
1948 which was named for the British Army's [Zion Mule
Corps](Zion_Mule_Corps "wikilink") of the World War I, a forerunner of
the [Jewish Legion](Jewish_Legion "wikilink"). The
[IDF](Israel_Defense_Forces "wikilink") adopted the *"Kova Hitelmacher"*
\[ : hatmaker's cap\] for soldiers' uniforms in its early years.
