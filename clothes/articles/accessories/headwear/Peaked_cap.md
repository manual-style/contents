The **peaked cap**, **service cap**, **forage cap**, **barracks cover**
or **combination cap** is a form of headgear worn by the armed forces of
many nations, as well as many uniformed civilian organisations such as
[law enforcement agencies](law_enforcement_agencies "wikilink") and
[fire departments](fire_department "wikilink"). It derives its name from
its short [visor](visor "wikilink") ([American
English](American_English "wikilink"), known as a peak in [British
English](British_English "wikilink")), which was historically made of
polished leather but increasingly is made of a cheaper synthetic
substitute.

Other principal components are the crown, band and insignia, typically a
[cap badge](cap_badge "wikilink") and
[embroidery](scrambled_egg_(uniform) "wikilink") in proportion to rank.
Piping is also often found, typically in contrast to the crown colour,
which is usually white for [navy](navy "wikilink"), blue for [air
force](air_force "wikilink") and green for [army](army "wikilink"). The
band is typically a dark, contrasting colour, often black, but may be
patterned or striped.

In the [British Army](British_Army "wikilink"), each
[regiment](regiment "wikilink") and [corps](corps "wikilink") has a
different badge. In the United States Armed Forces, the cap device is
uniform throughout service branch, though different variants are used by
different rank classes.

## History

`in cap (unknown artist, c. 1865)]]`

The peaked cap originated in late 18th or early 19th-century [Northern
Europe](Northern_Europe "wikilink"), usually worn by
[working-class](working_class "wikilink") men. In the later years of the
[Napoleonic Wars](Napoleonic_Wars "wikilink"), it began to appear in the
senior ranks of the [Russian](Russia "wikilink") and
[Prussian](Prussia "wikilink") armies, being popular because of its
comfort and light weight, as opposed to the cumbersome
[bicorns](bicorne "wikilink") and [shakos](shako "wikilink") that were
standard duty issue. During the [Biedermeier](Biedermeier "wikilink")
period (1815–48), they became universal dress for German and Austrian
civilian males of all classes, and for the entire 19th century, they
were popular with the working classes all over Northern Europe, although
in [Britain](United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "wikilink") the
[flat-top cap](Flat_cap "wikilink") was preferred by civilians towards
the end of the century.

In 1846, the [United States Army](United_States_Army "wikilink") adopted
the peaked cap during the [Mexican-American
war](Mexican-American_war "wikilink") due to the unsuitability of the
shako in the hot Mexican climate. In 1856, a form of peaked cap was
adopted by petty officers of Britain's [Royal
Navy](Royal_Navy "wikilink"), in imitation of an undress headdress worn
by officers from as early as 1827. The [British
Army](British_Army "wikilink") adopted peaked caps in 1902 for both the
new khaki field dress and (in coloured form) as part of the "walking
out" or off-duty wear for other ranks. A dark blue version was worn with
dress blues by all ranks of the U.S. Army between 1902 and 1917.

During the 20th century, the combination or peaked cap became common in
the armies, navies, air forces and police forces of the world, forgone
in combat by common soldiers in favour of more protective [combat
helmets](combat_helmet "wikilink").

## Australia

### Australian Defence Force

`wearing the khaki service cap in 1992.]]`

In the [Australian Army](Australian_Army "wikilink"), the peaked cap is
known as the service cap and is generally worn with the "Patrol Blues"
[order of
dress](Uniforms_of_the_Australian_Army#1980s_to_Present "wikilink") by
all ranks with the cap colour being blue. Formerly, a khaki service cap
could be worn by [warrant
officers](Warrant_officer#Australia "wikilink"), [commissioned
officers](commissioned_officers "wikilink") and
[officer](Officer_cadet#Australia "wikilink")[/staff](Corps_of_Staff_Cadets "wikilink")
cadets with the service uniform on non-ceremonial occasions until
September 2010.

In the [Royal Australian Air
Force](Royal_Australian_Air_Force "wikilink"), the peaked cap is the
standard headdress for all ranks, usually worn with service dress,
ceremonial dress and tropical dress among others.

In the [Royal Australian Navy](Royal_Australian_Navy "wikilink"), the
peaked cap is the standard headdress worn by all ranks above [leading
seaman](Leading_seaman#Australia "wikilink") when wearing ceremonial
uniform, regular day dress and informal evening dress among others.

## Austria

Throughout the 19th century, the [Austro-Hungarian
army](Austro-Hungarian_army "wikilink") were issued with
[shakos](shako "wikilink"), originally in black leather and later in
[pike grey](pike_grey "wikilink") wool. Gradually, the height of the
shako decreased and the cardboard stiffening removed until, by 1908, it
had evolved into the [ski cap](ski_cap "wikilink"). This was worn by
Austrian officers and enlisted personnel during both World Wars, but
when the postwar [Austrian Bundesheer](Austrian_Bundesheer "wikilink")
was established in 1955 an [olive drab](olive_drab "wikilink") peaked
cap and American style uniform were introduced.

## Canada

The cap was used in the early stages of the [First World
War](First_World_War "wikilink") as the primary headgear, but increased
head injuries lead to their replacement with the [Brodie
helmet](Brodie_helmet "wikilink") as primary combat head protection.

### Canadian Forces

's [service dress](service_dress "wikilink") uniform.\]\] In the
[Canadian Forces](Canadian_Forces "wikilink"), the peaked cap ( ) is the
primary headgear for men's [Royal Canadian
Navy](Royal_Canadian_Navy "wikilink") [service
dress](service_dress "wikilink"). It has been abandoned in the [Royal
Canadian Air Force](Royal_Canadian_Air_Force "wikilink") in favour of
the [wedge cap](side_cap "wikilink"). It has also been eliminated from
the [Canadian Army](Canadian_Army "wikilink") in favour of the
[beret](beret "wikilink"), with two exceptions. General officers wearing
army uniform can wear either a beret or a peaked cap with service dress.
[Royal Canadian Infantry
Corps](Royal_Canadian_Infantry_Corps "wikilink") members of foot guards
units such as the [Canadian Grenadier
Guards](Canadian_Grenadier_Guards "wikilink") wear the
[bearskin](bearskin "wikilink") cap with full dress but the peaked cap
with undress and service dress.

On navy caps, the peak and chinstrap of the service cap are always
black. The cap band is black with the exception of navy [military
police](Canadian_Forces_Military_Police "wikilink"), who wear a scarlet
cap band, and members of [Canadian Special Operations Forces
Command](Canadian_Special_Operations_Forces_Command "wikilink"), who
wear a tan cap band.

On both navy and army caps, the chinstrap is affixed to the cap via two
small buttons, one roughly over each ear; these buttons are miniature
versions of the buttons on the service dress tunic, and as such bear an
RCN or regimental device.

The peak of the cap of [non-commissioned
members](non-commissioned_member "wikilink") and [subordinate
officers](subordinate_officer "wikilink") is left plain, and officers'
caps are adorned with one or more bands of braid (depending on rank) at
the forward edge of the peak. The peak of the [junior
officer](junior_officer "wikilink")'s cap has a gold band along the
forward edge, that of the [senior
officer](field_grade_officer "wikilink") has a row of gold
[oak](oak "wikilink") leaves across the forward edge, while that of the
[flag officer](flag_officer "wikilink") has two rows of gold
[oak](oak "wikilink") leaves, one along the forward edge and one near
the cap band. The same oak leaves are worn by the [Governor General of
Canada](Governor_General_of_Canada "wikilink") as [Commander-in-Chief of
the Canadian
Forces](Commander-in-Chief_of_the_Canadian_Forces "wikilink").

The service cap is theoretically unisex, although there exists a
[service hat](service_hat "wikilink") ( ) for women. The service hat
does not have a crown top and has a stiff brim all around. The front of
the brim is formed into a visor and the sides and back are folded
upwards.

### Other organisations

The [Canadian Coast Guard](Canadian_Coast_Guard "wikilink") shares a
similar cap and colours with the [Royal Canadian
Navy](Royal_Canadian_Navy "wikilink").

Police forces across Canada also wear a peaked cap. The cap is basic
black with colour cap band of either of red (municipal forces), blue
([Ontario Provincial Police](Ontario_Provincial_Police "wikilink")
(OPP)) or yellow ([Royal Canadian Mounted
Police](Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police "wikilink")). The peaked cap of
the [Sûreté du Québec](Sûreté_du_Québec "wikilink") is green with a
green band and yellow piping.

Until recently the OPP's front line officers wore a black [Campaign
hat](Campaign_hat "wikilink"), but has since reverted to the peaked cap.
The RCMP only use the Campaign hat for formal dress uniform or by
members of the [Musical Ride](Musical_Ride "wikilink").

## Denmark

`wearing peaked cap, 1985]]`

In Denmark, the use of peaked cap has seen a gradual decline from
official uniforms, but it is still used in the ceremonial uniforms the
general corps of the [Army](Royal_Danish_Army "wikilink"), officers of
the [Airforce](Royal_Danish_Air_Force "wikilink"), officers of the
[Navy](Royal_Danish_Navy "wikilink"), the
[police](Police_of_Denmark "wikilink") and fire department.

## Germany

Peaked caps were first issued to German [Landwehr](Landwehr "wikilink")
troops during the [Napoleonic Wars](Napoleonic_Wars "wikilink"), since
these were cheaper and easier to maintain than the heavy leather
[shakos](shako "wikilink") and elaborate
[tailcoats](tailcoat "wikilink") worn by the British, French and Russian
armies. The Prussian army was also the first to adopt the [frock
coat](frock_coat "wikilink"), so officers would not soil their dress
uniforms on campaign.

When the was introduced during the 1840s, enlisted German troops were
issued with peakless [forage caps](forage_cap "wikilink") resembling the
[sailor cap](sailor_cap "wikilink"). Officers, however, continued to
wear the peaked cap, or , to set themselves apart from the French, who
wore the [kepi](kepi "wikilink"). Initially, German peaked caps were in
the uniform color, e.g., Prussian blue, cornflower blue, green, etc.,
but before the First World War a [field grey](field_grey "wikilink") hat
was issued, with piping colour coded for infantry, artillery or cavalry.
These caps, known as "crushers", could be worn beneath a or stuffed into
a pocket or knapsak

In 1935, the Nazis introduced new uniforms designed for modern
mechanised warfare. However, the basic design including the peaked cap
remained the same as in the [Weimar
Republic's](Weimar_Republic "wikilink")
*[Reichsheer](Reichsheer "wikilink")*. But the new national emblem
featuring eagle clutching swastika, and Black-red-white roundel in oak
wreath were introduced on the caps. Enlisted personnel and
non-commissioned officers were issued with peaked caps with leather
chincord. Officers received caps with metallic chincord. Both
enlisted-NCO's caps and Officer's caps featured specially colored piping
around the cap according to their service branch(White for infantry,
pink for panzer and so on). [Gestapo](Gestapo "wikilink") and SS men
were issued with black featuring a silver [death's
head](Totenkopf "wikilink"). On campaign, Wehrmacht officers often
removed the wire stiffening so the cap would resemble the older First
World War–era crusher.

### Modern German army

After the Second World War, both the [West
German](West_German "wikilink") [Bundeswehr](Bundeswehr "wikilink") and
[East German](East_German "wikilink") [National People's
Army](National_People's_Army "wikilink") continued to be issued uniforms
derived from the Second World War pattern. East German caps bore the DDR
State Cockade with the Hammer and Compass design, while West German caps
had a cockade in the German national colours, and a badge featuring a
pair of crossed swords. After reunification, the remained part of the
German army [dress uniform](dress_uniform "wikilink").

## Hong Kong

The peaked cap and peaked hat are worn as formal dress by members of the
[Hong Kong Disciplined
Services](Hong_Kong_Disciplined_Services "wikilink") (police, fire,
customs/excise, immigration, etc.) with influence from the
[British](United_Kingdom "wikilink") colonial services. All caps use
black as base colour. The crown is flat and round in shape. Female
police officers' caps have a coloured band, no crown top and front of
the brim is flat with sides/back folded upwards.

Only members of the [Hong Kong Police](Hong_Kong_Police "wikilink")'s
[Tactical units](Hong_Kong_Police#Tactical_Units "wikilink"), [Emergency
unit](Hong_Kong_Police#Emergency_Unit "wikilink"), and motorcycle
officers do not wear the peaked cap when on duty.

Members of the [Hong Kong Sea Cadet
Corps](Hong_Kong_Sea_Cadet_Corps "wikilink"), [Hong Kong Adventure
Corps](Hong_Kong_Adventure_Corps "wikilink") and [Hong Kong Air Cadet
Corps](Hong_Kong_Air_Cadet_Corps "wikilink") (including the [Ceremonial
Squadron](Ceremonial_Squadron "wikilink")) use the British-based cap.

Members of the [People's Liberation Army Hong Kong
Garrison](People's_Liberation_Army_Hong_Kong_Garrison "wikilink") also
wear a peaked cap, but the design is more influenced from the former
[Soviet Union](Soviet_Union "wikilink"), and varies with those used in
Hong Kong. However, since from 2007, PLA started to change to adapt the
Type 07 Service Uniform, the new uniform retains peaked cap but the
style is more like the US and Commonwealth peaked cap instead of the
Soviet style caps.

## Indonesia

Members of the armed and uniformed services in
[Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink") wear the Peaked cap during ceremonial
and operational duties. It is widely worn by the [Indonesian National
Police](Indonesian_National_Police "wikilink"), the [Indonesian Armed
Forces](Indonesian_Armed_Forces "wikilink") and other uniformed
institutions in the country.

## Israel

In the [Israel Defense Forces](Israel_Defense_Forces "wikilink"),
combination caps are used only by:

-   [Air Force](Israel_Air_Force "wikilink") Officers;
-   [Navy](Israeli_Sea_Corps "wikilink") officers in ceremonial dress;
-   [Military Police](Military_Police_Corps_(Israel) "wikilink")
    soldiers in law enforcement duties;
-   [Israel defense forces
    orchestra](Israel_defense_forces_orchestra "wikilink") Soldiers;
-   Some [regimental sergeants
    major](Regimental_Sergeant_Major "wikilink") of other service
    branches, in ceremonial dress.

## Macau

Members of the [Public Security Police Force of
Macau](Public_Security_Police_Force_of_Macau "wikilink") do not wear
peaked caps (berets or ball caps), but [Corpo de Bombeiros de
Macau](Corpo_de_Bombeiros_de_Macau "wikilink") dress uniform utilises
the cap.

## Poland

The [rogatywka](rogatywka "wikilink") is a 4-cornered type of peaked
cap, related to the [czapka](czapka "wikilink") and worn by members of
the [Polish Land Forces](Polish_Land_Forces "wikilink").

[Naval](Polish_Navy "wikilink") officers and [air
force](Polish_Air_Force "wikilink") personnel, however, wear
conventional peaked caps.

## Russia

Russia was the first country to adopt the peaked cap. The official act
of adopting the cap for military use was made by [Alexander I of
Russia](Alexander_I_of_Russia "wikilink") in 1811. During the
[Napoleonic Wars](Napoleonic_Wars "wikilink"), various early versions of
the peaked cap were in use in the Russian army. Imperial Russia
abandoned the cap for a short period in the second half of the 19th
century for a [forage cap](forage_cap "wikilink") similar to the one
used by Americans during their [civil
war](American_Civil_War "wikilink"), but the peaked cap soon returned.
Early soldiers' peaked caps were, in fact, peakless, hence the nickname
(soldier's flapjack) for the headgear; officers' caps had peaks from the
start and looked like modern peaked caps. The peakless version remained
in use in the Russian navy under the name of (literally "peakless one")
and is still worn by Russian seamen. Also during the Imperial period,
peaked caps were introduced as part of government officials' uniforms.
[Serfs](Serf "wikilink") and [peasants](peasant "wikilink") adopted an
almost identical hat into their fashion after the Napoleonic Wars, known
as a .

In 1914, peakless caps were abolished everywhere in Russian armed forces
except the Navy, and modern peaked caps were issued to all soldiers.
However, after the [October Revolution of
1917](October_Revolution_of_1917 "wikilink"), it was replaced in Red
Army field uniforms by the [budenovka](budenovka "wikilink"), and later
by the [garrison cap](garrison_cap "wikilink"). The dress uniforms, on
the other hand, retained this headgear, and various paramilitary Soviet
agencies like the [NKVD](NKVD "wikilink") or [VOKhR](VOKhR "wikilink")
kept using it in all uniforms. Agencies like railway workers, firemen,
pilots, mining supervisors, foresters, customs officers in the Soviet
Union also were organised along military lines and wore uniforms with
peaked caps of various designs.

In 1990s, the Russian peaked cap was redesigned and widely issued to the
armed forces and police. Caps of this shape are most associated with
Russia among foreigners, since they are large and high. In 2012, after
[Sergey Shoygu](Sergey_Shoygu "wikilink") was appointed Minister of
Defence, the design of the peaked cap was changed again to a lower and
more proportional style.

### Soviet client states

During the [Cold War](Cold_War "wikilink"), uniforms copied from the
Russian pattern were issued to the armies of various Asian, Eastern
European and African [communist](communist "wikilink") regimes.
Particularly famous are the oversized caps worn by [North Korean
army](North_Korean_army "wikilink") officers, unchanged since the 1950s.

## United Kingdom

–era British soldier wearing khaki forage cap\]\] Royal Navy officers
were first issued peaked caps in 1825 as a less formal alternative to
the [bicorne hat](bicorne_hat "wikilink"). From 1846, it was worn with a
crown on the front, and later (from 1856), gold braid was added to the
brim to ensure commissioned officers were instantly recognised by their
subordinates. [Commanders](Commander_(Royal_Navy) "wikilink"),
[captains](Captain_(Royal_Navy) "wikilink") and
[commodores](Commodore_(Royal_Navy) "wikilink") had one gold wreath on
their peaks, whereas flag officers had two. Before the Second World War,
naval officers were required to possess two caps: one with a white cover
for summer and one without for winter. However, flag officers often
preferred the white-topped cap in order to stand out from their
subordinates.

British army officers wore blue peaked caps as early as the [Crimean
War](Crimean_War "wikilink") to distinguish themselves from enlisted men
who wore the [pillbox hat](pillbox_hat "wikilink"). The peaked caps were
widely worn on campaign during the First and Second World Wars, until
the more practical [beret](beret "wikilink") was popularised by generals
like [Bernard Montgomery](Bernard_Montgomery "wikilink"). After the war,
officers continued to wear khaki caps as part of the [Number 2 dress
uniform](Number_2_dress_uniform "wikilink"), but by the 1990s these had
been phased out in favour of the dark blue and red caps previously worn
with the [Number 1 dress uniform](Number_1_dress_uniform "wikilink").

Peaked caps were first issued to enlisted men in 1908 to replace the
[Glengarry caps](Glengarry_cap "wikilink") and [pillbox
hats](pillbox_hat "wikilink") of the [Boer
War](Second_Boer_War "wikilink") era. The new caps were made of
[khaki](khaki "wikilink") wool and sometimes had a neck flap to protect
against the cold. Nicknamed the "gor blimey", these caps are associated
with the First World War '[Tommy Atkins](Tommy_Atkins "wikilink")' and
continued to be issued to members of the [Home
Guard](Home_Guard_(United_Kingdom) "wikilink") and [Territorial
Army](Territorial_Army_(United_Kingdom) "wikilink") during the Second
World War.

### Royal Navy

`wearing an early Royal Navy officer's cap, 1840s]]`

[Royal Navy](Royal_Navy "wikilink")
[officers](Officer_(armed_forces) "wikilink"), [Warrant
officers](Warrant_officer "wikilink"), and [Senior
Rates](Naval_rating "wikilink") today wear a framed cap with a white
cover and a black band in Nos 1, 2 and 3 Dress; originally worn only in
tropical climates, the white cover was adopted for all areas after the
Second World War. Officers have an option of a cotton or plastic cover.

### Royal Marines

[Royal Marines](Royal_Marines "wikilink") wear a cap with a white cover
and a red band with 'Blues' uniform. The Royal Marines Band Service also
wear this cap with the Lovat Uniform and Barrack Dress.

### Army

`wearing dark blue cap with red band as part of the `[`Dress`` ``Uniform`](Dress_Uniform "wikilink")`]]`

Most regiments and corps of the [British Army](British_Army "wikilink")
wear a [forage cap](forage_cap "wikilink") in Numbers 1 and 2
[Dress](British_Army_uniform "wikilink"), the exceptions being:

-   [The Royal Tank Regiment](The_Royal_Tank_Regiment "wikilink"),
    [Royal Regiment of
    Fusiliers](Royal_Regiment_of_Fusiliers "wikilink"), [Army Air
    Corps](Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom) "wikilink"), [Parachute
    Regiment](Parachute_Regiment_(United_Kingdom) "wikilink"),
    [SAS](Special_Air_Service "wikilink"), [Intelligence
    Corps](Intelligence_Corps_(United_Kingdom) "wikilink") and [4/73
    Special OP Battery
    RA](4/73_(Sphinx)_Special_Observation_Post_Battery_RA "wikilink")
    who wear [berets](berets "wikilink");
-   Personnel attached to the above also wear the appropriate coloured
    beret (For example, REME Mechanics or RLC Chefs attached to the
    unit)
-   The [Royal Regiment of
    Scotland](Royal_Regiment_of_Scotland "wikilink") who wear a
    regimental [Glengarry](Glengarry "wikilink") with cockfeathers taken
    from the former ceremonial uniform of the [Royal
    Scots](Royal_Scots "wikilink");
-   The [Royal Irish Regiment](Royal_Irish_Regiment_(1992) "wikilink")
    who wear the [Caubeen](Caubeen "wikilink");
-   The [Brigade of Gurkhas](Brigade_of_Gurkhas "wikilink") who wear a
    round Kilmarnock cap in No 1 dress and the [Slouch
    hat](Slouch_hat "wikilink") in No 2 Dress
-   The [Queen's Royal Hussars](Queen's_Royal_Hussars "wikilink"), whose
    officers wear a [tent hat](forage_cap "wikilink") in No 2 Dress.

It has a cap band which may be coloured (red for all Royal Regiments and
Corps), a crown (formerly khaki, now dark blue, except for Military
Police which has always been red, and the Rifles who wear Rifle Green)
which may have coloured piping or a regimental/corps colour and a patent
leather peak and chinstrap. The chinstrap is usually secured above and
across the peak and secured at each end by a small (20 line) button of
the appropriate regimental or corps pattern.

Officers in some regiments are also required to wear a khaki version of
the cap, often called the "Service Dress Cap" with Service Dress (the
Officers' No 2 Dress) or Barrack Dress; the design of this dates back to
the cap worn in the field until replaced by the steel helmet during the
First World War.

### RAF

All ranks of the [Royal Air Force](Royal_Air_Force "wikilink") wear a
cap with a blue-grey crown and a black band, worn with the appropriate
badge in No 1 dress, and sometimes in other types as well. The peak is:

-   Black and polished for [airmen](Airman "wikilink"),
    [non-commissioned officers](RAF_other_ranks "wikilink") (NCOs) and
    [warrant officers](warrant_officer "wikilink")
-   Blue-grey fabric for officers of the rank of [Wing
    Commander](Wing_Commander_(rank) "wikilink") and below. Officer
    cadets wear a white band instead of a black band.
-   Black and polished with gold rank braid for officers of [Group
    Captain](Group_Captain "wikilink") and above

### Police

*See also:* [Police uniforms and equipment in the United
Kingdom#Uniform](Police_uniforms_and_equipment_in_the_United_Kingdom#Uniform "wikilink")

Basic headgear for male police officers in the UK is a peaked cap. This
includes a cap badge and generally has a black and white diced band
(called [Sillitoe Tartan](Sillitoe_Tartan "wikilink")) around the hat.

### Royal Yacht Clubs

Full members of Royal Yacht Clubs wear a black doeskin cap with plain
black leather peak and a black band, worn with the appropriate
individual club's badge.

Flag officers' caps are not distinguished by oak leaves or similar
devices.

## United States

### United States Marine Corps

In the [United States Marine
Corps](United_States_Marine_Corps "wikilink"), these caps are also worn,
in two forms. For all ranks, the device is the [Eagle, Globe, and
Anchor](Eagle,_Globe,_and_Anchor "wikilink") device. In addition,
officers wear a lace cross on the top, called the
[quatrefoil](quatrefoil "wikilink"), a traditional mark of distinction
from the Marine Corps' foundation enabling sharpshooters aboard ships to
identify friendly officers from foes. For [blue
dress](Uniforms_of_the_United_States_Marine_Corps#Blue_Dress "wikilink")
uniforms, the cap is white with a gold device for enlisted, while the
gold and silver device is for officers. Only the visor is black, and the
chin strap is black for enlisted Marines; it is gold and scarlet for
officers. For the [service
uniforms](Uniforms_of_the_United_States_Marine_Corps#Service_uniform "wikilink"),
an olive drab combination cap is available; the device is black, and the
chin strap is black for all ranks. In both cases, [field grade
officers](field_grade_officer "wikilink")
([majors](Major_(United_States) "wikilink"), [lieutenant
colonels](Lieutenant_colonel_(United_States) "wikilink") and
[colonels](Colonel_(United_States) "wikilink")) have gold oak leaf
motifs on the visor, similar to those worn by navy
[commanders](Commander_(United_States) "wikilink") and
[captains](Captain_(United_States) "wikilink"), while [general
officers](general_officer "wikilink")' caps have a different, larger oak
leaf motif on the visor. Additionally the blue dress cap of the
Commandant of the Marine Corps (as well as the [Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff](Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff "wikilink") if it
is also a Marine) adds an additional gold oak leaf motif to the front of
the band. In the Marine Corps, the combination cap is referred to as the
"barracks cover." Also referred as the dress cap or service cap in
Marine Corps Orders.

### United States Navy

In the [United States Navy](United_States_Navy "wikilink"), midshipmen,
[chief petty officers](chief_petty_officer "wikilink"), and
[commissioned officers](Officer_(armed_forces) "wikilink") wear
combination covers, but there are differences between the three types.
Midshipmen at the [United States Naval
Academy](United_States_Naval_Academy "wikilink"), [United States
Merchant Marine
Academy](United_States_Merchant_Marine_Academy "wikilink") or in [Naval
Reserve Officers Training
Corps](Naval_Reserve_Officers_Training_Corps "wikilink") (NROTC) units
wear a combination cap with a gold chinstrap attached by gold buttons,
with a gold [fouled anchor](fouled_anchor "wikilink") device. A chief
petty officer wears a combination cap with a black chinstrap attached
with gold buttons, with a device consisting of a gold fouled anchor with
silver block letters "USN" superimposed on the shank of the anchor, with
the addition of one, two, or three stars at the top of the anchor if the
wearer is a [Senior Chief Petty
Officer](Senior_Chief_Petty_Officer "wikilink"), a [Master Chief Petty
Officer](Master_Chief_Petty_Officer "wikilink"), or the [Master Chief
Petty Officer of the
Navy](Master_Chief_Petty_Officer_of_the_Navy "wikilink"), respectively;
while a commissioned officer wears a combination cap with a gold
chinstrap attached by gold buttons, with an officer crest device, a
silver [federal shield](federal_shield "wikilink") over two crossed gold
[fouled anchors](fouled_anchor "wikilink"), surmounted by a silver
eagle. Chief petty officer and junior commissioned officer visors are
shiny black plastic without ornamentation. Officers O-5
([Commander](Commander_(United_States) "wikilink")) and above have gold
embroidered oak leaves and acorns on a black felt-covered visor, with
additional embroidery for [flag officers](flag_officers "wikilink")
(O-7, or [rear admiral lower
half](Rear_Admiral_(lower_half) "wikilink"), and above), referred to as
"[scrambled eggs](Scrambled_eggs_(uniform) "wikilink")." The thin
plastic crowns come in [khaki](khaki "wikilink") or in white (since
1963, the white combination cap is worn with both white and blue
uniforms). The black band around the cap includes a black circle
extending upward on the front of the crown as a backing behind the
device. The gold buttons on the sides of the cover that fasten the chin
strap are of a design to match the gold buttons on the service dress
jacket and the snaps on officer shoulder boards. For the former female
cap the brim was folded up on both sides whereas the men's cap has no
brim but a visor at the front; the female cap was discontinued October
2018.

### United States Army

In the [United States Army](United_States_Army "wikilink") soldiers of
ranks Specialist and below are not authorized to wear a combination cap
and may only wear a beret with the [blue
service](Army_Service_Uniform "wikilink") uniform. The combination cap
for the [blue service](Army_Service_Uniform "wikilink") and blue dress
uniforms of noncommissioned officers (Corporal and above) has a golden
stripe on top of the cap band, black chinstrap; the device is the
[United States' coat of
arms](Great_Seal_of_the_United_States "wikilink") in front of a gold
disk (the exception is the [Sergeant Major of the
Army](Sergeant_Major_of_the_Army "wikilink") whose device is a
gold-colored rendering of the U.S coat of arms surrounded by a
gold-coloured wreath). The version for [warrant
officers](Warrant_Officer_(United_States) "wikilink") and [company-grade
officers](company-grade_officer "wikilink") ([second
lieutenants](Second_Lieutenant#United_States "wikilink"), [first
lieutenants](First_Lieutenant#U.S._Army,_U.S._Marine_Corps_and_U.S._Air_Force "wikilink"),
& [captains](Captain_(United_States) "wikilink")) has a cap band with
the [branch-of-service
color](United_States_Army_branch_insignia#Branch_of_service_insignia "wikilink")
between two golden stripes, and a gold-colored chinstrap. [Field-grade
officers O-4 and Above](Field_Grade_Officers "wikilink")
([major](Major_(United_States) "wikilink"), [lieutenant
colonel](Lieutenant_colonel_(United_States) "wikilink"), and
[colonel](Colonel_(United_States) "wikilink")) have oak leaves known
unofficially as ["scrambled eggs"](Scrambled_Eggs_(Military) "wikilink")
on the visor. [General officers](General_officer "wikilink")' caps are
similar to those of field-grade officers, but the cap band is dark blue
and embroidered with gold oak leaf motifs. Warrant officers' cap device
and all commissioned officers' cap device is a gold-color rendering of
the United States' coat of arms, larger than that of soldiers and
lacking the golden disk backing.

A similar hat was regulation from 1902 until 1917.

### United States Air Force

In the [United States Air Force](United_States_Air_Force "wikilink"),
all personnel have the option to wear service caps, but only field-grade
([major](Major_(United_States) "wikilink") through
[colonel](Colonel_(United_States) "wikilink")) and [general
officers](general_officer "wikilink") are required to own one. The
service cap is issued without charge to enlisted airmen assigned to
certain ceremonial units and details.

With the exception of enlisted airmen assigned to the [Air Force
Band](The_United_States_Air_Force_Band "wikilink") and the [Air Force
Base Honor Guard](United_States_Air_Force_Base_Honor_Guard "wikilink"),
each of which has its own distinctive cap insignia and other uniform
devices, Air Force combination caps bear a relief of the [Great Seal of
the United States](Great_Seal_of_the_United_States "wikilink") rendered
in silver-colored metal. For enlisted members, the arms are surrounded
by a silver-colored metal circle. (The [Chief Master Sergeant of the Air
Force](Chief_Master_Sergeant_of_the_Air_Force "wikilink") has a wreath
instead of the circle). Commissioned officers' insignia is larger and
lacks the encompassing circle.

The chinstrap is secured to each side of the cap with a silver-colored,
screw-in, metal button bearing an updated and simplified version of the
"Hap Arnold emblem" first designed by James T. Rawls for use by the Air
Force's predecessor, the [Army Air
Forces](United_States_Army_Air_Forces "wikilink"), in 1942. Apart from
the screw-back, the buttons are of the same design as those used to
secure the uniform coat's epaulets and pockets.

Enlisted airmen's chinstraps and visors are of plain black leather or
polymer material. All commissioned officers' chinstraps are also of
plain black leather or polymer material. The visors of company-grade
officers ([second
lieutenant](Second_Lieutenant_(United_States)#United_States "wikilink")
through [captain](Captain_(United_States) "wikilink")) are plain black
leather or polymer material. [Field-grade
officers](Field_Grade_Officers "wikilink")' visors have two pairs of
clouds and lightning bolts, patterned after the oak leaf motifs used by
the other services. General officers' caps add an extra pair of clouds
and bolts on the visor, while the cap of the [Chief of Staff of the
United States Air
Force](Chief_of_Staff_of_the_United_States_Air_Force "wikilink") adds
clouds and bolts around the entire cap band. The clouds and bolts are
jokingly referred to in [military slang](military_slang "wikilink") as
"[farts and darts](farts_and_darts "wikilink")", much as the other
services' oak leaf motifs are known as "scrambled eggs".

The USAF service cap is also worn by the Air Force's civilian auxiliary,
the [Civil Air Patrol](Civil_Air_Patrol "wikilink"). Senior members
(those over the age of 18 who are not cadets and everyone over 21) may
wear the service cap with the CAP-specific service cap device. Similar
to the Air Force, company grade officers (and NCOs) wear the service cap
with a plain brim, field-grade officers wear the service cap with two
sets of clouds and bolts on the brim, and general officers wear the
service cap with three sets of clouds and bolts. Cadet officers of the
CAP also have the option to wear the service cap with the distinctive
CAP cadet officer service cap device. The brim is always plain black
leather or polymer, regardless of the cadet's
[rank](Cadet_grades_and_insignia_of_the_Civil_Air_Patrol "wikilink").
The service cap may also be worn by cadets of a CAP Honor Guard detail,
even if they are not cadet officers. The manner of wearing is identical
to that of a cadet officer.

#### United States Army Air Forces

During [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), the "50 mission crush"
cap was popular among aircrews of the [United States Army Air
Forces](United_States_Army_Air_Forces "wikilink").
[Bomber](Bomber "wikilink") and fighter aircrews had to wear
[headsets](headphones "wikilink") over their service cap during flight,
so they would remove the stiffening wire from the cap. The headset would
then crush the cap, which would eventually retain its crushed
appearance. Since it took a good many missions to properly achieve the
look, a so-called "50-mission crush" cap was considered a sign of a
seasoned combat veteran. Current US Air Force regulations prohibit the
wearing of such caps.

### United States Coast Guard

The United States Coast Guard wears the combination cap, known as the
combo cover, with the Service Dress Blue uniform (SDBs), the Tropical
Blue Long uniform (Trops), and with all other formal dress uniforms. The
cover is identical to that of the navy with respect to the chinstrap and
peak ornamentation. Its crown is white. The buttons securing the chin
strap to the sides of the band are smaller versions of the buttons worn
on the Coast Guard's uniform coats. The blue band around the cap
includes blue fabric extending upward on the front of the crown to serve
as a backing behind the device. In the case of enlisted personnel, this
extension is a blue circle identical to that on the caps of Naval
officers and chief petty officers. In the case of commissioned officers,
however, the extension is a more elaborate polygon to accommodate the
officers' cap device.

Unlike their naval counterparts, coast guardsmen below the rank of chief
petty officer wear combination covers; their cap device is a golden
representation of the coast guard emblem. Coast guard chief petty
officers' cap devices match those of the navy, albeit with a shield on
the front of the fouled anchor; like navy chiefs, their cap devices are
enlarged renderings of the rank insignia worn on their collars. Coast
guard officers' cap device is an eagle with wings outstretched, above an
anchor grasped horizontally in its talons.

### Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and NOAA Commissioned Corps

The [Public Health Service Commissioned
Corps](United_States_Public_Health_Service_Commissioned_Corps "wikilink")
and the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned
Corps](National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration_Commissioned_Corps "wikilink")—the
two small services, consisting only of officers, which are the two
[uniformed services](Uniformed_services_of_the_United_States "wikilink")
that are not [armed forces](United_States_armed_forces "wikilink")—wear
uniforms and rank insignia adopted from the Navy. The combination covers
of the two services are identical to those of the Navy with respect to
colors, and peak ornamentation. The chinstrap of the PHS is gold with a
burgundy stripe. The buttons securing the chin strap to the sides of the
band are smaller versions of the buttons worn on the services' uniform
coats. The cap device of NOAACC officers is similar to that of Navy
officers with a globe in place of the shield; the cap device of PHSCC
officers is similar to that of Navy officers but has a
[caduceus](caduceus "wikilink") in place of one of the anchors.

### United States Maritime Service

While the majority of American merchant mariners are employed by
shipping businesses and accordingly wear either uniforms prescribed by
their employers or civilian attire, some officers receive commissions in
the [United States Maritime
Service](United_States_Maritime_Service "wikilink") for federal
government duty, such as the faculty of the [United States Merchant
Marine Academy](United_States_Merchant_Marine_Academy "wikilink") and
the [Military Sealift Command](Military_Sealift_Command "wikilink")'s
civilian officers manning non-commissioned [United States Naval
Ships](United_States_Naval_Ship "wikilink"). These officers wear
uniforms and rank insignia adopted from the U.S. Navy, albeit with
[United States Merchant
Marine](United_States_Merchant_Marine "wikilink")'s own button design,
cap device, awards, and decorations. The combination covers these
officers are identical to those of naval officer with respect to colors,
chinstrap and peak ornamentation. The buttons securing the chin strap to
the sides of the band are smaller versions of the buttons worn on their
coats. The USMS cap device is a rendering of the Merchant Marine device
in gold- and silver-colored metal. Like the device worn by naval
officers, it features a silver eagle, with wings outstretched, above a
gold shield; the shield, however, is defaced with an anchor and
surrounded by a wreath.

## Civilian usage

`band]]`

Public safety officers, such as those from the
[police](police "wikilink"), [fire
department](fire_department "wikilink"),
[ambulance](ambulance "wikilink") service, and
[customs](customs "wikilink"), often wear peaked caps, especially on
formal occasions. In the US, police forces use caps that have softer
tops and are not round and rigid in form (notable are those worn in New
York and San Francisco). [British](UK "wikilink") and
[Australian](Australia "wikilink") policemen have a [checkerboard
pattern](checkerboard_pattern "wikilink") on the cap band, and [traffic
wardens](traffic_warden "wikilink") often have a reflective yellow
strip.

A number of civilian professions—the most notable modern examples being
[merchant marine](merchant_marine "wikilink") and [civil
aviation](civil_aviation "wikilink")—also wear peaked caps. In such
civilian old traditional usage, only
[captains](Captain_(nautical) "wikilink") aboard ships and [pilots in
command](Pilot_in_command "wikilink") (airline captains) in service
aboard aircraft, have the golden oak leaf motifs ("[scrambled
eggs](Scrambled_Eggs_(Military) "wikilink")") on the visor; this is in
contrast to the [naval](Navy "wikilink") tradition, where it is also
worn by commanders (one rank below captain) as well as by commodores and
flag officers.

The original civilian variant of the peaked cap was widely worn by
sailors and workers from the mid 19th century onwards. These were made
of wool or canvas, and sometimes waterproofed with tar. During the
1960s, blue denim [Greek fisherman's
caps](Greek_fisherman's_cap "wikilink") became an essential accessory
for the [counterculture](counterculture "wikilink") due to their use by
[John Lennon](John_Lennon "wikilink") of [the
Beatles](the_Beatles "wikilink"). A black leather version, sometimes
embellished with chains or metal studs, was worn by bikers,
[greasers](greaser_(subculture) "wikilink") imitating [Marlon
Brando](Marlon_Brando "wikilink") in *[The Wild
One](The_Wild_One "wikilink")*, and members of the 1970s [Black
Power](Black_Power "wikilink") movement.

Peaked caps are also commonly worn around the world by some railway, or
airport staff (baggage porters, but often wearing kepi type cap), [bus
drivers](bus_driver "wikilink") and [Security
guards](Security_guard "wikilink").

[Student caps](Student_cap "wikilink") in Northern and Central European
countries are frequently peaked caps. The student caps in [Nordic
countries](Nordic_countries "wikilink") are traditionally white (summer
uniform) or black (winter uniform) but the colors of the bands,
[lining](lining_(sewing) "wikilink"), [tassels](tassel "wikilink") and
[cockades](cockade "wikilink") differ, depending on the school or the
faculty. In German-speaking countries and in Poland, Estonia and Latvia,
student caps come in a variety of colors, depending on the
[colors](couleur "wikilink") of the [student
organization](studentenverbindung "wikilink") or the school, and can be
decorated with its [zirkel](Zirkel_(Studentenverbindung) "wikilink") (a
[monogram](monogram "wikilink")).

## "Crusher cap"

A typical peaked cap has a spring stiffening, often in the form of a
wire grommet frame, to ensure the sides and rear of the fabric covering
have the proper shape. A crusher cap removes the stiffener to allow
headphones to be worn over the hat or use in confined spaces such as
tanks and submarines, giving it a slouched and worn "crushed"
appearance. Such modified caps were especially popular among US Army Air
Forces combat pilots and German tank commanders and submariners in the
[Second World War](Second_World_War "wikilink").
