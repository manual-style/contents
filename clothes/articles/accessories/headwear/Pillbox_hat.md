A **pillbox hat** is a small hat, usually worn by women, with a flat
crown, straight, upright sides, and no brim. It is named after the small
cylindrical or hexagonal cases that pills used to be sold in.

## History and description

Historically, the precursor to the pillbox hat was military
[headgear](headgear "wikilink"). During the late [Roman
Empire](Roman_Empire "wikilink"), the *pileus pannonicus* or "Pannonian
cap" – headgear similar to the modern pillbox hat – was worn by Roman
soldiers. A similar hat was popular with the
[Flemish](Flemish_people "wikilink") in the [Middle
Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink"). In some countries, especially those of
the [Commonwealth of Nations](Commonwealth_of_Nations "wikilink"), a
pillbox-like [forage cap](forage_cap "wikilink"), often with a chin
strap, can still be seen on ceremonial occasions. The [Royal Military
College of Canada](Royal_Military_College_of_Canada "wikilink") [dress
uniform](dress_uniform "wikilink") includes such a hat, and similar caps
were standard issue for the [Victorian era](Victorian_era "wikilink")
[British Army](British_Army "wikilink"). Another cap called a
[kilmarnock](Balmoral_bonnet "wikilink") is a modern version of the
traditional headdress worn by members of virtually all
[Gurkha](Gurkha "wikilink") regiments.

The modern woman's pillbox hat was invented by
[milliners](millinery "wikilink") in the 1930s, and gained popularity
due to its elegant simplicity. Pillbox hats were made out of
[wool](wool "wikilink"), [velvet](velvet "wikilink"),
[organdy](organdy "wikilink"), [mink](mink_fur "wikilink"),
[lynx](lynx "wikilink") or [fox](fox_fur "wikilink")
[fur](fur "wikilink"), and [leopard skin](Animal_print "wikilink"),
among many other materials. They were generally designed in solid colors
and were unaccessorized, but could include a [veil](veil "wikilink").

[Jacqueline Kennedy](Jacqueline_Kennedy "wikilink"), [First Lady of the
United States](First_Lady_of_the_United_States "wikilink") from 1961 to
1963, was well known for her "signature pillbox hats", designed for her
by [Halston](Halston "wikilink"), and was wearing a pink one to match
her [outfit](Pink_Chanel_suit_of_Jacqueline_Bouvier_Kennedy "wikilink")
on the day of her husband President [John F.
Kennedy](John_F._Kennedy "wikilink")'s
[assassination](Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy "wikilink") in [Dallas,
Texas](Dallas,_Texas "wikilink").

## In popular culture

-   Pillbox hats are a satirical subject of the song "[Leopard-Skin
    Pill-Box Hat](Leopard-Skin_Pill-Box_Hat "wikilink")" by [Bob
    Dylan](Bob_Dylan "wikilink"). The song first appeared on his 1966
    album *[Blonde on Blonde](Blonde_on_Blonde "wikilink")*. Actress
    [Natalie Portman](Natalie_Portman "wikilink") wore the pillbox hat
    in the film *[Jackie](Jackie_(2016_film) "wikilink")* (2016).
