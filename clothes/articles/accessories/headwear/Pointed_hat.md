[Tate Britain](Tate_Britain "wikilink").\]\] **Pointed hats** have been
a distinctive item of [headgear](headgear "wikilink") of a wide range of
cultures throughout history. Though often suggesting an ancient
[Indo-European](Proto-Indo-Europeans "wikilink") tradition, they were
also traditionally worn by women of [Lapland](Sápmi "wikilink"), the
[Japanese](Japanese_people "wikilink"), the
[Mi'kmaq](Mi'kmaq "wikilink") people of Atlantic
[Canada](Canada "wikilink"), and the
[Huastecs](Huastec_people "wikilink") of Veracruz and Aztec (illustrated
e.g. in [Codex Mendoza](Codex_Mendoza "wikilink")). The Kabiri of [New
Guinea](New_Guinea "wikilink") have the *diba*, a pointed hat glued
together.

## History

Existence of the conical hat is known as early as the [Bronze
Age](Bronze_Age "wikilink") in [Middle East](Middle_East "wikilink") and
[Central Europe](Central_Europe "wikilink"). One example is the [golden
hat](golden_hat "wikilink") worn by members of the priesthood , likely
as a ceremonial accessory. In Ancient Greece, the
[pilos](pilos "wikilink") was a common conical traveling hat. Popular
among Burgundian noblewomen in the 15th century was a type of conical
headgear now called a [hennin](hennin "wikilink"). Conical hats were
also popular in late medieval
[Vijayanagar](Vijayanagara_Empire "wikilink"),
[India](India "wikilink").

### Bronze Age

The conical [golden hats](golden_hat "wikilink") of [Bronze
Age](Bronze_Age "wikilink") [Central Europe](Central_Europe "wikilink")
were probably a ceremonial accessory worn by the priesthood. See also
[horned helmet](horned_helmet "wikilink").

### Iron Age

Textile analysis of the [Tarim Mummies](Tarim_Mummies "wikilink") has
shown some similarities to the [Iron Age](Iron_Age "wikilink")
civilizations of Europe dating from 800 BC, including woven
[twill](twill "wikilink") and [tartan](tartan "wikilink") patterns
strikingly similar to tartans from Northern Europe. One unusual find was
a distinctively pointed hat:


*Yet another female – her skeleton found beside the remains of a man –
still wore a terrifically tall, conical hat just like those we depict on
witches riding broomsticks at Halloween or on medieval wizards intent at
their magical spells.*

Pointed hats were also worn in ancient times by [Saka](Saka "wikilink")
([Scythians](Scythians "wikilink")), and are shown on
[Hindu](Hindu "wikilink") temples (as helmets and metal crowns) and in
[Hittite](Hittites "wikilink") [reliefs](relief "wikilink"). As
described by [Herodotus](Herodotus "wikilink"), the name of the
[Scythian](Scythian "wikilink") tribe of the *tigrakhauda*
([Orthocorybantians](Orthocorybantians "wikilink")) is a
[bahuvrihi](bahuvrihi "wikilink") compound literally translating to
"people with pointed hats".

Besides the Scythians, the [Cabeiri](Cabeiri "wikilink") as well as
[Odysseus](Odysseus "wikilink") are traditionally pictured wearing a
[Pilos](Pilos "wikilink"), or woolen conical hat.

### Middle Ages

`from the `[`Japanese`](Japan "wikilink")` `[`Heian`` ``period`](Heian_period "wikilink")`]]`

The 13th-century [Cumans](Cumans "wikilink") commonly wore [scythian
style pointed hats](bashlyk "wikilink"), and are reported to have fought
wearing them.

Originating from the [Japanese](Japan "wikilink") [Heian
period](Heian_period "wikilink"), the [kazaori
eboshi](kazaori_eboshi "wikilink") (風折烏帽子) was worn by aristocrats
to indicate rank. Still worn today for ceremonial purposes, this black
linen hat was used during a samurai's ceremony in attaining manhood.

`wearing a `*[`Jewish`` ``hat`](Jewish_hat "wikilink")*` (`[`Codex`` ``Manesse`](Codex_Manesse "wikilink")`, 14th century)]]`

The [Papal tiara](Papal_tiara "wikilink") in the Middle Ages is
sometimes shown as more pointed than in more recent centuries, though
also shown with no point. *[Mitra papalis](Mitra_papalis "wikilink")* is
a type of [conch](conch "wikilink") named after the papal mitre for its
form.

Medieval [Jewish](Jew "wikilink") men wore distinctive headgear as
required by European Christian authorities. This included the pointed
*[Jewish hat](Jewish_hat "wikilink")* (or "Judenhut") already worn by
Jews, a piece of clothing probably imported from the Islamic world and
perhaps before that from Persia.

Popular among Burgundian noblewomen in the 15th century was a type of
conical headgear now called a [hennin](hennin "wikilink").

## Modern times

`in rural `[`Louisiana`](Louisiana "wikilink")`]]`

The *[Spitzhut](Spitzhut "wikilink")* is a traditional kind of headgear
in [Bavaria](Bavaria "wikilink").

Pointed [hoods](Hood_(headgear) "wikilink") were used by various orders
and Catholic lay confraternities for processions, e.g. the *[Semana
Santa](Semana_Santa "wikilink")* of [Sevilla](Sevilla "wikilink") who
wore the [Capirote](Capirote "wikilink").

Pointed hats are still worn in the rural
[Louisiana](Louisiana "wikilink") [Mardi Gras](Mardi_Gras "wikilink")
celebrations by the [Cajuns](Cajuns "wikilink"), the *[Courir de Mardi
Gras](Courir_de_Mardi_Gras "wikilink")*, where they are known as
[capuchons](capuchon "wikilink").

The [Ku Klux Klan](Ku_Klux_Klan "wikilink") has worn this headgear since
its first era.

Tall conical hats are common to traditional folk ceremonies in many
parts of Europe, particularly at [Carnival](Carnival "wikilink") time.
Examples can still be seen in [Italy](Italy "wikilink"),
[Spain](Spain "wikilink") and [Bulgaria](Bulgaria "wikilink").

The [May Day](May_Day "wikilink") [hobby horses](hobby_horse "wikilink")
of [Padstow](Padstow "wikilink") and [Minehead](Minehead "wikilink") in
[southwest England](South_West_England "wikilink") have pointed hats
with masks attached.

## Folklore and fiction

Classical pointed hats are worn by the
[dwarfs](Dwarf_(mythology) "wikilink"), [witches](Witchcraft "wikilink")
and [wizards](Magician_(paranormal) "wikilink") of European Folklore.
