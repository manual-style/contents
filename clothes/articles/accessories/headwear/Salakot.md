A **salakót** is a traditional wide-brimmed hat from the Philippines. It
is often made of either rattan or [Phragmites](Phragmites "wikilink")
reeds, and is a Filipino traditional headdress similar to the iconic
conical hat found in neighbouring Southeast and [East
Asian](East_Asia "wikilink") countries. The
[Visayans](Visayans "wikilink") also call this headgear *"sadok"* or
*"sarok"*.

## History

The headress must have found itself taken along the [Malay
immigration](Models_of_migration_to_the_Philippines "wikilink") to the
Philippine Archipelago. Ancient [Madja-as](Madja-as "wikilink")
tradition recounts that the first [Malay](Ethnic_Malays "wikilink")
settlers in the archipelago purchased the valleys and plains of
[Panay](Panay "wikilink")
[Island](Islands_of_the_Philippines "wikilink") from the native
[Aetas](Aeta "wikilink"), in exchange for a golden salakót and a very
long pearl necklace called a *manangyad*, which touched the ground when
worn by the wife of the [Aeta](Aeta "wikilink") chieftain.

The custom of embellishing the salakót developed during the later part
[Spanish Era](History_of_the_Philippines_(1521-1898) "wikilink"). Though
normally worn by farmers, wealthy and landed [Christian
Filipinos](Roman_Catholicism_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") and
[mestizos](mestizo "wikilink") (especially the members of the nobility
called the *[Principalía](Principalía "wikilink")*) would also wear the
salakót. This class started to adopt a characteristic style of dress and
carry regalia. They wore a distinctive type of salakot made of more
prized materials like tortoise shell. The special *salakot* of the
ruling upper class was often adorned with ornate capping spike crafted
in metals of value like silver, or, at times, gold. This headgear was
usually embossed also with precious metals and sometimes decorated with
silver coins or pendants that hung around the rim. Many depictions of
*[gobernadorcillos](gobernadorcillo "wikilink")* and *[cabezas de
barangay](cabeza_de_barangay "wikilink")* would portray these colonial
public functionaries as wearing ornate salakots. It was not uncommon for
this class to wear salakót made of more valuable materials, such as
tortoiseshell and precious metals.

## Cultural significance

The salakot is a common symbol for Filipino identity, often worn by the
[National personification](National_personification "wikilink") [Juan
dela Cruz](Juan_dela_Cruz "wikilink").

In 2012, Teofilo Garcia of [Abra](Abra_(province) "wikilink") in
[Luzon](Luzon "wikilink"), expert artisan of a special kind of *salakot*
made of [gourd](gourd "wikilink") (*Lagenaria leucantha*) was awarded by
the [National Commission for Culture and the
Arts](National_Commission_for_Culture_and_the_Arts "wikilink") with the
*"Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan"* (National Living Treasures Award) for
his dedication to the traditional craft of making gourd salakot,
affirming the *salakot* (the object of his art) as one of the
[intangible cultural heritage](intangible_cultural_heritage "wikilink")
of the Philippines under the traditional craftsmanship category.
