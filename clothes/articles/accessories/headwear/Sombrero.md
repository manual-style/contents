**Sombrero** ( ; Spanish for "hat", literally "shadower") in English
refers to a type of wide-brimmed hat from [Mexico](Mexico "wikilink"),
used to shield from the sun. It usually has a high pointed crown, an
extra-wide brim (broad enough to cast a shadow over the head, neck and
shoulders of the wearer) that's slightly upturned at the edge, and a
chin string to hold it in place. In Spanish, sombrero refers to any
wide-brimmed hat; in Mexico the hat is called *Sombrero de charro*.

## Design

Sombreros, like the [cowboy hats](cowboy_hat "wikilink") invented later,
were designed in response to the demands of the physical environment.
The concept of a broad-brimmed hat worn by a [rider on
horseback](equestrianism "wikilink") can be seen as far back as the
[Mongolian horsemen](Mongol_invasion_of_Europe "wikilink") of the 13th
century. In hot, sunny climates hats evolved to have wide brims, which
provided shade. The exact origin of the Mexican sombrero is unknown, but
it is usually accepted that the hat originated with Mestizo cowboys in
Central Mexico. Although *sombrero* is usually taken to refer to the
traditional Mexican headwear, the term *sombrero* predates this item of
clothing, and is and has been applied to several differing styles of
hat, since it is simply the word for hat in Spanish. Other types of hats
known as *sombrero* can be found in South America and Spain, including
the *[sombrero calañés](sombrero_calañés "wikilink"), [sombrero
cordobés](sombrero_cordobés "wikilink")* and *[sombrero de
catite](sombrero_de_catite "wikilink")* (Spain)*, [sombrero
vueltiao](sombrero_vueltiao "wikilink")* (Colombia).

Many early Texan cowboys adopted the Spanish and Mexican sombrero with

Spain.

The Mexican variation of the sombrero added an even wider brim and a
high, conical crown. These are the hats worn by
[mariachi](mariachi "wikilink") musicians and Both types of sombreros
usually include a or chin strap.

In the [Western United States](Western_United_States "wikilink"), the
sombrero had a high conical or cylindrical crown with a saucer-shaped
brim, highly embroidered and made of plush felt.

In the Philippines, due to the influence from Spain brought about by the
[Manila galleon](Manila_galleon "wikilink") trade, the term has been
assimilated into the [Tagalog language](Tagalog_language "wikilink") in
the form of and now refers to any hat – from actual sombreros to
[baseball caps](baseball_cap "wikilink").
