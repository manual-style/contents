The **songkok** or **peci** or **kopiah** is a [cap](cap "wikilink")
widely worn in [Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink"),
[Brunei](Brunei "wikilink"), [Malaysia](Malaysia "wikilink"),
[Singapore](Singapore "wikilink"), the southern
[Philippines](Philippines "wikilink") and southern
[Thailand](Thailand "wikilink"), most commonly among
[Muslim](Muslim "wikilink") males. It has the shape of a truncated cone,
usually made of black or embroidered [felt](felt "wikilink"), cotton or
[velvet](velvet "wikilink"). It is also worn by males in formal
occasions such as weddings and funerals or festive occasions such as the
[Eid ul-Fitr](Eid_ul-Fitr "wikilink") and [Eid
al-Adha](Eid_al-Adha "wikilink") holidays. In Indonesia, the peci is
also associated with the nationalist movement.

## Names

It is called "songkok" in the [Ethnic Malay](Ethnic_Malay "wikilink")
cultural sphere in [Malay Archipelago](Malay_Archipelago "wikilink").
While in [Java](Java "wikilink"), it is called "kopiah" or "kopeah". It
is also known widely in Indonesia as "peci", although peci has a more
ellipse shape and sometimes decorated. The name "peci" was probably
derived from the Dutch word *petje* means literary "small hat", or
possibly derived from the Turkish *[fez](fez "wikilink")* instead. All
names refer to the same object.

## Origin

`(Rejimen Askar Melayu DiRaja) wearing songkok at bayonet practice, Singapore Island (1941).]]`

The origin of the songkok can be traced to the
[fez](Fez_(clothing) "wikilink"), which was adopted by the
[Ottomans](Ottomans "wikilink") in 1826 and subsequently spread to
[South Asia](South_Asia "wikilink") and to the [Malay
Archipelago](Malay_Archipelago "wikilink") (now called
[Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink"), [Malaysia](Malaysia "wikilink") and
[Brunei](Brunei "wikilink")). The songkok used to be worn during the
[Ottoman Empire](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") and in some parts of
[Africa](Africa "wikilink"). One Brunei newspaper account erroneously
states that the songkok became a norm in Malay Archipelago in the 13th
century with the coming of Islam in the region. The earliest written
mention of the word *songkok* is in [Syair Siti
Zubaidah](Syair_Siti_Zubaidah "wikilink") (1840). While traditional
triangular Malay headress of *[Tengkolok](Tengkolok "wikilink")* or
*destar* is associated with traditional Malay nobles and royalties,
songkok on the other hand has become part of traditional
[Malay](Ethnic_Malay "wikilink") men's costume associated with Islam,
traditionally worn by local [ulamas](ulama "wikilink").

The [Royal Malay Regiment](Royal_Malay_Regiment "wikilink") of the
[Malaysian Army](Malaysian_Army "wikilink") have been using the songkok
as part of their uniform since under British rule.

## Current use

Traditionally songkok are associated with Muslim men's cap. However, in
[Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink"), the songkok has become the national
headress with secular nationalist connotations made popular by
[Sukarno](Sukarno "wikilink"). Numbers of Indonesian nationalist
movement activist in early 20th century wore peci such as Sukarno,
[Mohammad Hatta](Mohammad_Hatta "wikilink"), and [Agus
Salim](Agus_Salim "wikilink"). However, as the first [president of
Indonesia](president_of_Indonesia "wikilink") it was Sukarno that
popularised peci — more precisely plain black velvet peci — as national
men's cap of Indonesian, and Indonesian male presidents have worn peci
as part of their official presidential attire ever since. Indonesian
official palace guards also wore peci as part of their uniform. The
[Paskibraka](Paskibraka "wikilink") (Indonesian: *pasukan pengibar
bendera pusaka*) or flag raising squad in Indonesian independence day
ceremony also wear peci, and there is even female peci version with
curved back. The [Betawi people](Betawi_people "wikilink") wear the
Songkok as their traditional headdress usually colored dark red.

In Malaysia, traditional male Malay attire consists of a songkok, shirt,
matching pants, and waist wrap that is called a *[baju
melayu](baju_melayu "wikilink")*. In a [Dewan Undangan
Negeri](Dewan_Undangan_Negeri "wikilink") or in [Dewan
Rakyat](Dewan_Rakyat "wikilink"), a member is required to wear the
songkok to comply with the dress code of the assembly.

In Singapore, the songkok is not allowed to be worn in government
schools as part of the uniform as Singapore is officially a secular
state and all religious headgear is not allowed to be worn. It is part
of the standard uniform at *[madrasahs](madrasah "wikilink")* (Islamic
religious schools).

The songkok also plays a role in the heraldry of the defunct [Sultanate
of Sulu](Sultanate_of_Sulu "wikilink").
