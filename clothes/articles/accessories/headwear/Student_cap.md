In various [European](Europe "wikilink") countries, **student caps** of
different types are, or have been, worn either as a marker of a common
identity, as is the case in the [Nordic
countries](Nordic_countries "wikilink"), or to identify the wearer as a
member of a smaller body within the larger group of students, as is the
case with the caps worn by members of German
*[Studentenverbindungen](Studentenverbindung "wikilink").*

## Belgium

Belgian student caps can be divided into 2 main variants, the *calotte*,
worn by students at [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "wikilink")
[universities](universities "wikilink") and the *penne*, worn by
students at liberal/non-Catholic universities.

### Calotte

The [calotte](calotte_(Belgium) "wikilink") originates from the skullcap
worn by the [Zouave papal regiment](Zouave_papal_regiment "wikilink")
around 1860. The *calotte* is cylindrical, made from velvet and
astrakhan (pelt of newborn lamb. The color of the top is bordeau red for
the universities of [Brussels](Brussels "wikilink"),
[Leuven](Katholieke_Universiteit_Leuven "wikilink"),
[Louvain-la-Neuve](Université_catholique_de_Louvain "wikilink") and
[Namur](Facultés_universitaires_Notre-Dame_de_la_Paix "wikilink"), white
for the [University of Ghent](University_of_Ghent "wikilink") and
emerald for the [University of Liège](University_of_Liège "wikilink").

In the front of the *calotte* are stripes representing the Belgian flag
(black, yellow and red) and stripes representing the colors of the city
or the university where the *calotte* has been received. At the back of
the *calotte*, the faculty of the student is represented by a color and
a symbol, with if needed an additional symbol to determine the
speciality. Golden stars around the *calotte* represent the number of
years that the student has studied successfully (if a year has to be
retaken, a silver star will represent it). In addition to that, a number
of official and personal pins will be added to the *calotte*, all
representing something about its owner examples include:

-   Official position in a student organisation (above the considered
    year’s star)
-   Hobbies and occupations (cardplayer, partyer...)
-   Character (patriotic, lazy...)

The *calotte* is awarded after a rite of passage called *Corona* (from
Latin *crown*, for the shape of the assembly) by numerous student unions
called *Ordres*, *Cercles* and *Régionales* to hundreds of students each
year. Requirements to get the *calotte* vary, but always include a
minimum time spent on the given campus, a knowledge of the *calotte*,
Latin formulae and student songs.

### Penne

\]\] Like the *calotte*, the *penne* ("klak" in Dutch) is only awarded
after a student-organized initiation ceremony. The number of gold stars
represent the number of years of study, with silver stars representing
years that were failed and re-done. For years of study before the
initiation (if any), the stars are not placed centrally, but instead off
to the side of the head. In Brussels, the student's official nickname is
spelled out in brass pins along the rim of the hat. The colour of the
band around the edge represents the faculty in which they study, with a
different colour for each faculty. The hat is additionally extensively
decorated as the student sees fit.

## France

\]\]

In France, students wear a black [beret](beret "wikilink") called
[Faluche](Faluche "wikilink") since 1888.

## German-speaking countries

In Germany, members of student societies wear various forms of caps as
part of their attire. Common types of caps are *Stürmer*, *Tellermütze*
and *Tönnchen*.

## Nordic countries

In the [Nordic countries](Nordic_countries "wikilink"), student caps
were first adopted as a common mark of recognition by the students from
[Uppsala University](Uppsala_University "wikilink") on the occasion of a
[Scandinavian student meeting](Nordic_student_meeting "wikilink") in
Copenhagen in 1845. In subsequent years similar caps were adopted by the
students at the other Swedish university
([Lund](Lund_University "wikilink")) and by the students in Denmark,
Norway, and Finland. Caps of the same type are known to have been used
by German students since the early 18th century, and it is possible that
the original impulse came from Germany.

### Denmark

In Denmark, the student caps (*studenterhue*) are the last remains of
the old school uniform of the [University of
Copenhagen](University_of_Copenhagen "wikilink") . They came in two
colours: black for the winter uniform \[in the 19th century with black
jacket and long black trousers\] and white for the summer uniform. The
caps are worn by students who have completed an upper secondary level
education. The student cap is made of linen with a black brim and is
supplied with a band and a red and white cockade with a badge. The band
color and badge varies after which exam it represents.

When this school uniform vanished in the late 19th century, the two caps
came to denote two different kinds of
[studentereksamen](studentereksamen "wikilink"): the
classical-linguistic exam with the black student’s cap and the white for
the modern language + mathematical exams. Both with a Bordeaux-coloured
band.

When the student cap came out, it was only connected to
[studentereksamen](studentereksamen "wikilink") (STX) which at that time
was the only upper secondary level education there was, and was
connected to a very high status, because very few people graduated. From
the 1970s three other upper secondary level educations were made.
[Higher Preparatory Examination
(HF)](Higher_Preparatory_Examination_(HF) "wikilink"), [Higher
Commercial Examination
Programme](Higher_Commercial_Examination_Programme "wikilink") (HHX),
and [Higher Technical Examination
Programme](Higher_Technical_Examination_Programme "wikilink") (HTX).
From about 1990 there has also been student caps for other educations,
including 10th grade and
[SOSU](Social-_og_sundhedsassistent "wikilink"). More variants of the
caps are still being developed with special coloured cords and badges,
because more educations want their own cap.

**Traditions** There is a long list of traditions with the Danish
student cap. They have, of course, been changed and will vary from place
to place. Here are a few:

-   It is bad luck to try on a student's cap before completion of the
    last exam. This can be counteracted by jumping over the cap
    backwards 3 times.
-   It’s tradition to write the grade given in the last exam in the
    middle of lining of the student's cap.
-   Classmates and friends write in the lining.
-   The student with the biggest and/or the smallest head has to give
    beer to the whole class.
-   The student cap can be marked with notches, cuts and so on, in
    connection with the "rules" of the student cap.
-   There are taunt songs connected with the rivalry between the
    different educations, for example between
    [Gymnasium](Gymnasium_(school) "wikilink") and
    [HF](Higher_Preparatory_Examination_(HF) "wikilink"): “There is only
    one cap and it’s red – and if it’s blue it’s way too easy to get” or
    HTX to STX "Hvis den er rød, er den ikke mere værd end brød"
    (translation: "If it's red, it's not worth more than bread".

All the time new and new rules comes up for wearing the student cap in
Denmark, at current there is 27 public known rules of what to do with
your hat, when you have to do stuff etc. example is you'll have to cut a
lightning in the hat if, you have intercourse while wearing the hat.

The cross is not a Christian badge. It is modelled after the maltese
cross of the [Order of Dannebrog](Order_of_Dannebrog "wikilink") and
thereby symbolizes the tie between the student and the state. However,
students may opt for alternative badges, for example:

-   Star of David for Jews
-   Crescent moon for Muslims
-   Maple leaf for atheists and other religious persuasions
-   A red sun on a white background, for Greenlanders
-   A treble clef
-   A piece of a puzzle (fair trade student cap)
-   Hammer and sickle for socialists and communists was available up
    until 2016

### Estonia

In Estonia, student caps are popular symbols of academic institutions
and student organizations, and are worn not just by university students
but also by school children as part of their [school
uniform](school_uniform "wikilink"). Most caps are made of wool
[felt](felt "wikilink") or velvet, and have the same basic shape of a
Nordic student cap or a [mariner's cap](mariner's_cap "wikilink") with a
black beak but with a different [cockade](cockade "wikilink"), [cap
badge](cap_badge "wikilink") and colors, depending on the affiliation.

All students enrolled at a university are entitled to wear a standard
student cap which has a white crown, a black band, and a black beak. At
the front of the band is a metallic cockade depicting the [temple of
Apollo](temple_of_Apollo "wikilink") .

The students that are members of traditional,
[German-type](Studentenverbindung "wikilink") [fraternities and
sororities](fraternities_and_sororities "wikilink") which have
[couleurs](couleur "wikilink"), generally opt to wear caps in the colors
of their organizations. As most of the couleurs are tricolors, the crown
of the cap is made in the "top" color of the tricolor, and the band
divided horizontally in middle and bottom colors. The center of the
crown is embroidered in a contrasting color with the
[zirkel](Zirkel_(Studentenverbindung) "wikilink") of the organization or
related symbols.

The uninitiated, novice members of fraternities and sororities wear
unicolor caps, turquoise in the [Estonian Students'
Society](Estonian_Students'_Society "wikilink"), black in other
[corps](German_Student_Corps "wikilink"). To distinguish between
different organizations, a metal pin in the shape of a zirkel of the
organization is worn on the left side of the cap band.

### Finland

The Finnish student cap (*ylioppilaslakki*) tradition follows the
Swedish model, like many other Finnish academic traditions. The Finnish
student cap has an appearance similar to the Swedish version, but
instead of coloured fabric [cockade](cockade "wikilink"), it has a
metallic, gold-colored cockade depicting the [lyre](lyre "wikilink") of
[Apollo](Apollo "wikilink"), the insignia of the [University of
Helsinki](University_of_Helsinki "wikilink"). The cap was introduced in
its present form in the 1870s. Until the 1950s, the university students
usually wore the cap during the whole summer holiday of the university,
from [Walpurgis Night](Walpurgis_Night "wikilink") till the end of
September. Nowadays, the cap is used mostly during 1 May and in academic
ceremonies and occasions. The cap is worn by all Finnish high school
(*[lukio](lukio "wikilink")*) graduates who have completed the Finnish
[matriculation examination](Matriculation_exam_(Finland) "wikilink").

Until 1917, the matriculation examination was the entrance exam of the
[University of Helsinki](University_of_Helsinki "wikilink"), which meant
that all high-school graduates were, at least formally, students of the
University of Helsinki. In memory of that period, all new student cap
have the cockade of the student union of the University of Helsinki. In
many Finnish universities, the student union recommends that the
students change the cockade to a university-specific one.

`(on the left) with two other high school graduates wearing students caps in about 1900.]]`

In the late 19th century, the [language
strife](Finland's_language_strife "wikilink") between
[Swedish](Swedish-speaking_Finns "wikilink")- and
[Finnish-speakers](Finns#Finnish-speaking_Finns "wikilink") divided the
Finnish academia. The size of the cockade was used to signal the
student's opinion to the language question: the Swedish-speaking
students wore a cockade with a diameter of 22 mm, moderate
Finnish-speakers a 16 mm cockade and radical Finnish-speakers a 14 mm
cockade. Even today, the Swedish-speakers use the 22 mm cockade, while
the graduates of Finnish-speaking high schools use a 16 mm cockade.

The [lining](lining_(sewing) "wikilink"), i.e. the inside, of the cap
symbolizes the regional identity of the graduate. Especially in earlier
days, the students usually choose the lining to have the colours of
their own [student nations](student_nation "wikilink"). Nowadays, the
most typical lining is the white and blue, symbolizing common
patriotism. However, the Swedish-speaking students usually wear red and
yellow, or blue, yellow and white, while in
[Satakunta](Satakunta "wikilink") and [North
Karelia](North_Karelia "wikilink"), the regional colours are still
popular. The Swedish-speaking students in Ostrobothnia use black, yellow
and red.

As in Sweden, the students of [engineering](engineering "wikilink")
usually wear a special student cap ( ) with a long tassel. However,
unlike in Sweden, the crown of the Finnish Engineering student cap is
always white and the cap has a gold-coloured, university-specific
cockade, except in [University of Oulu](University_of_Oulu "wikilink"),
where the cockade is program specific. The tassel is always black and
worn without any additions. The lining of the engineering caps is dark
red, symbolizing the social change brought about by the ever-advancing
technology, except in [Lappeenranta University of
Technology](Lappeenranta_University_of_Technology "wikilink"), where
Karelian colours, red and black, are used, in University of Oulu, where
the student cap has a blue lining, and in the cap of
[Teknologföreningen](Teknologföreningen "wikilink"), the
Swedish-speaking student nation at the [Aalto
University](Aalto_University "wikilink"), with a red-yellow-red lining.
The Engineering student caps are worn by present engineering students
and graduate engineers on the 1st day of May and in academic ceremonies.

### Iceland

At each high-school and or junior college ceremonial graduation the
graduating students are allowed to wear their student caps for the first
time. Know simply as *stúdentshúfa*, the Icelandic student caps have
mostly the same shape and colour as the other traditional Nordic student
caps of Sweden and Denmark, they however tend to have a slightly tighter
fit and appear somewhat stiffer and more defined in shape.

It has a white crown, a black band and a black peak. At the front of the
band is a silver star.

One of the caps distinctive traits is the possibility of removing the
top white crown, which in return reveals a black version of the cap's
crown. This is due to the Icelandic tradition dictating that after an
entire year as a graduate and after finishing a year of university
education the student should remove the white cover-piece, signifying
his or hers academic status as a university *stúdent*. This practice has
its roots in the traditions concerning the black caps of the Danish
students. During the year the cap is white, the student is known as
*nýstúdent* or new-student.

The first Icelandic students to wear these caps were graduates of
"Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík" or "Reykjavík College". In modern times
different versions have been introduced. These caps often have different
coloured crowns which differ from the traditional white coloured crown.
This is done in order to allow students which graduate at secondary
level from schools specialising in academic trade- industry- and/or
craftmen-programs, "iðnskóli". The colours of these crowns are often red
or green.

### Norway

`in `[`Sweden`](Sweden "wikilink")`, 1942.]]`

The [Norwegian](Norwegian_people "wikilink") student cap (Studenterlue
or Duskelue), is mostly made of black [velvet](velvet "wikilink") with
the old [Apollo](Apollo "wikilink") symbol on the forehead (the symbol
of the old [University of Oslo](University_of_Oslo "wikilink")). The
tassel is made from [silk](silk "wikilink"). Norwegian students got
their caps on graduation, after throwing away the red
[russelue](russelue "wikilink"), made after a similar principle. After
1968, the use of this cap has been less and less frequent, but may be
seen on [Norwegian Constitution
Day](Norwegian_Constitution_Day "wikilink"), mostly worn by old
academics.

This cap came into use after 1850.

The Swedish student cap (*studentmössa*), used since the mid-19th
century by high school ([Gymnasium](Gymnasium_(school) "wikilink"))
graduates, normally has a white crown, a black (or dark blue) band, and
a black peak. At the front of the band is a
[cockade](cockade "wikilink") of blue and yellow, the colours of the
[Swedish flag](Swedish_flag "wikilink").

Swedish student caps traditionally come in two main variants, named
after the two universities in existence at the time of their original
adoption. The *Uppsala cap* has a black band, blue and yellow
[lining](lining_(sewing) "wikilink"), and a somewhat soft crown. The
*Lund cap* has a dark blue band, red lining, and a stiffer crown. The
earliest student cap known to have been preserved, a mid-19th century
Uppsala cap in the collections of the [Nordic
Museum](Nordic_Museum "wikilink") but currently exhibited at the
[Uppland Provincial Museum](Upplandsmuseet "wikilink") (in Uppsala), is
considerably softer and looser in style than the modern or even late
19th century caps.

The Uppsala cap was traditionally worn only in summer, from [Walpurgis
Night](Walpurgis_Night "wikilink") until the end of September. In Lund,
the white cap was also donned at Walpurgis and taken off in the fall,
but students could exchange it for a winter variant with a dark blue
crown during the rest of the year. Nowadays, the cap is usually only
worn during the single annual event of Walpurgis Night, and no winter
variant exists anymore.

A major variation on the student cap is the one worn by engineering
students, the *teknologmössa*, which has the same basic shape as the
regular student cap but has a triangular flap hanging down on the right
side ending in a tassel. The caps worn by engineering students usually
come in colours signalling the university of origin (e.g.
white=[Chalmers University of
Technology](Chalmers_University_of_Technology "wikilink") in
[Gothenburg](Gothenburg "wikilink"), [wine](wine_(color) "wikilink")
red=[Luleå University of
Technology](Luleå_University_of_Technology "wikilink")). The tasseled
cap originated at the [Chalmers University of
Technology](Chalmers_University_of_Technology "wikilink") in
[Gothenburg](Gothenburg "wikilink"), where it was first introduced in
1879, and is influenced by the Norwegian student cap, the *duskelue*,
which from 1856 had a tassel; during the period of the
[Swedish-Norwegian union](Swedish-Norwegian_union "wikilink") (until
1905) a large number of Norwegian students studied at Chalmers. It later
spread to the [Royal Institute of
Technology](Royal_Institute_of_Technology "wikilink") and the other
Swedish engineering schools.

Originally associated with completion of the
*[studentexamen](studentexamen "wikilink")*, the entrance examination to
the universities, which was at the time of the original adoption of
student caps always taken at the universities, the cap followed the
*studentexamen* to the secondary schools when these took over the final
examination of their students in 1864. After this point it was donned
upon graduation by everyone who completed the *studentexamen*, whether
they continued to university or not.

As the *studentexamen* in reality remained reserved for boys (and later
girls) from the [bourgeoisie](bourgeoisie "wikilink"), a very large
proportion of whom did enroll at university, the conversion of the cap
to a form of secondary school graduation cap did not in fact result in
the cap losing its association with university students. To some extent
this happened later, through the combination of two factors: firstly,
the radicalism of the 1960s and 1970s, which influenced many students to
stop using their caps (regarded as a sign of belonging to the
bourgeoisie) or even burn them publicly. Secondly, the simultaneous
(1968) reform of the secondary school system, through the abolition of
the *studentexamen* and the introduction of a large number of secondary
school programmes, many of which were vocational in character and not
intended to prepare for higher studies but all frequently co-existing in
the same schools.

The large number of new programmes introduced after 1970 also led to a
proliferation of new types of student caps, such as the one with a red
band (instead of the black or dark blue band of the traditional caps)
used by students completing the two-year vocational programmes. With the
caps now being used upon graduation by almost all secondary school
students, many of the caps have become to be more strongly associated
with the secondary school and the [coming of
age](coming_of_age "wikilink") rather than with the common identity as a
Swedish student, as had originally been intended. Recent developments in
the graduation hats has differentiated these hats further, such as with
the introduction as personalized embroideries, linings and colouring to
signify the student’s programme, place of education and origin.
Currently in Sweden there are a lot of companies that provide
personalized student caps, clothing, graduation caps etc. Many of these
companies have tie ups with the universities to provide the respective
caps regularly.
