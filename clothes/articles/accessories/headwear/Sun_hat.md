A **sun hat** (also known as the **harvest hat** or **field hat** ) is a
head covering specifically designed to shade the face and shoulders from
the [sun](sun "wikilink"). The sun hat incorporates a variety of
materials and types, including the straw sun hat, pressed fiber sun hat,
and the [pith helmet](pith_helmet "wikilink") (sun helmet). In modern
times, sun hats are common in places around the world, mainly in holiday
resorts residing in countries close to the Earth's
[equator](equator "wikilink"). They are particularly useful in
protecting against [ultraviolet rays](ultraviolet_rays "wikilink") (UV).
The style of a sun hat can range from small to large brims. However, as
a general guideline, the brim is four to seven inches in width.
