A **trucker hat**, **mesh cap** or **netback cap** is a type of
[baseball cap](baseball_cap "wikilink"). It is also sometimes known as a
"gimme \[as in 'give me'\] cap" or a "feed cap" because this style of
hat originated during the 1960s as a promotional give-away from U.S.
feed or farming supply companies to farmers, truck drivers, or other
rural workers.

## Description

`driver wearing mesh trucker hat.]]`

From the 1930s until the 1960s, [truckers](trucker "wikilink") were
provided with a type of [peaked cap](peaked_cap "wikilink") known as a
[Mechanic's cap](Mechanic's_cap "wikilink"). This often bore the logo of
the haulage company, and was later adopted by the
[1950s](1950s_teenage_fashion "wikilink") [greaser
subculture](greaser_subculture "wikilink"). By the early 1970s, this cap
had been replaced with the modern five piece mesh trucker hats, which
were given away at [truck stops](truck_stop "wikilink") by companies
like [Mountain Dew](Mountain_Dew "wikilink"),
[Dekalb](DeKalb_Genetics_Corporation "wikilink"),
[Budweiser](Budweiser "wikilink"), [Shell oil](Shell_oil "wikilink"), or
[John Deere](John_Deere "wikilink") to advertise their products.

The design of a trucker cap is similar to that of a baseball cap, with a
slightly curved bill in front, a cap constructed from six almost
triangular gores, and a button on top. Instead of being made of cotton
fabric like a typical baseball cap, the front section of a trucker hat
above the bill is foam, and the rest is plastic mesh for breathability.
The foam front of the hat stands up straight and stiff, which makes the
trucker hat taller than most baseball caps. There is an adjustable
plastic snap or [hook-and-loop](hook-and-loop "wikilink") closure in the
back to ensure that one size fits most. This design was intended to make
the cap much cooler in the sun or hot weather for the comfort of the
wearer.

The original feed caps bore company logos on the front foam section of
the cap, either printed or as a patch sewn on. These companies typically
had a rural clientele, such as the local feed store or [John
Deere](Deere_&_Company "wikilink") tractors. Trucker-style hats can now
be found with other pictures, logos, flags, camouflage, or humorous
sayings on the front. Trucker hats are still available as promotional
items.

## 21st century trend

In the [early 2000s](2000s_fashion "wikilink"), the trucker hat became a
mainstream fashion trend, predominantly among suburban American youth
associated with the [hip-hop](hip-hop "wikilink"), [pop
punk](pop_punk "wikilink") and [skater
subcultures](skater_subculture "wikilink"). This came about with a sense
of irony due to the hat's rural or [blue collar](blue_collar "wikilink")
association and typically older demographic. It has frequently been
donned by celebrities; musician [Pharrell
Williams](Pharrell_Williams "wikilink") and actor [Ashton
Kutcher](Ashton_Kutcher "wikilink") in particular helped make the hat
fashionable. However, in a 2008 interview with *[Fashion
Rocks](Fashion_Rocks "wikilink")* magazine, singer [Justin
Timberlake](Justin_Timberlake "wikilink") claimed that, while Kutcher
has been cited for popularizing the trucker hat, Timberlake had been
wearing them since the age of seventeen. The trucker hat trend was
lampooned in the *[King of the Hill](King_of_the_Hill "wikilink")*
episode "[Grand Theft Arlen](Grand_Theft_Arlen "wikilink")", in which
teenagers confuse [Hank Hill](Hank_Hill "wikilink") by asking where he
bought his Strickland Propane cap and questioning its irony.

Comedian [Judah Friedlander](Judah_Friedlander "wikilink") is known for
his signature trucker hats, which bear various humorous phrases. Having
worn trucker hats since the 1980s, Friedlander claims a fondness for
them and has ignored any rejecting or embracing fashion trends
surrounding the hats throughout the decades. In a 2007 interview, he
stated:

I was never into anything trendy. If I'm ever doing something that
happens to be trendy, it's probably a coincidence and I don't even
realize it's trendy. Just a note: I've been making and wearing trucker
hats for years—ince the '80s actually, when those were pretty much the
only kind of hats you could get. I remember about 10 years ago, people
used to make fun of me for wearing trucker style hats. And then when
they became trendy a couple years ago, those same people came up to me
and said shyly, 'Uhm, where do you get your hats? I need to get some.'
Years ago, some people used to get angry with me for wearing them and
someone even called me racist for wearing a trucker hat 'cause I looked
like a [redneck](redneck "wikilink"). I bet now, some people think I'm a
loser for wearing them because now they're out of fashion. But you know
what, I never wore 'em to be 'in' or trendy or cool. I just like 'em.
And I'll be wearing them long after they're a not a trend.

In recent times, many outlaw country, punk, metal, blues and rock
musicians have worn trucker hats on stage and in photographs. This
includes [Scott H. Biram](Scott_H._Biram "wikilink"), Bob Wayne of the
Outlaw Carnies, [Hank Williams III](Hank_Williams_III "wikilink"), Gary
Lindsey of [Assjack](Assjack "wikilink") and Black Eyed Vermillion, Zach
Shedd of [Assjack](Assjack "wikilink") and Hank III's Damn Band, Shawn
"McNasty" McWilliams also of the Damn Band, [Patrick
Stump](Patrick_Stump "wikilink") of [Fall Out
Boy](Fall_Out_Boy "wikilink"), Dave "Shep" Shepherd & "Dixie" Dave
Collins of [Weedeater](Weedeater_(band) "wikilink"), and many others.

Trucker hats are also worn by Early Cuyler from
*[Squidbillies](Squidbillies "wikilink")*, who wears a different hat in
each episode (and sometimes multiple hats within a single episode).

During the [2016 presidential
election](2016_presidential_election "wikilink"), [Donald
Trump](Donald_Trump "wikilink") popularized a red mesh trucker hat
featuring the slogan [Make America Great
Again](Make_America_Great_Again "wikilink") among [Republican
Party](Republican_Party_(United_States) "wikilink") supporters. Trump's
opponents responded with their own trucker hats parodying the original
message.
