A **Tudor bonnet** (also referred to as a **doctor's bonnet** or **round
cap**) is a traditional soft-crowned, round-brimmed cap, with a tassel
hanging from a cord encircling the hat. As the name suggests, the Tudor
[bonnet](Bonnet_(headgear) "wikilink") was popularly worn in
[England](England "wikilink") and elsewhere during
[Tudor](Tudor_period "wikilink") times.

Today the cap is strongly associated with
[academic](academic "wikilink") tradition. It is typically worn as part
of [academic dress](academic_dress "wikilink") by the holder of a
research or professional [doctoral](doctorate "wikilink") degree or a
full [higher doctorate](higher_doctorate "wikilink"). It may also be
worn by a person who has been awarded an honorary doctorate. At certain
educational establishments the cap distinguishes university officers,
such as the [esquire bedell](Esquire_Bedell "wikilink"), university
marshal, the president of the [students'
union](students'_union "wikilink"), and members of the [university
council](university_council "wikilink").

The cap is worn as traditional clothing with gowns and represents
suitable headgear especially for [livery](livery "wikilink") and burgess
[guild](guild "wikilink") officers.

Tudor bonnets can be made of velvet or cloth, usually black but
sometimes in other colors. The cord and tassel may be in a variety of
colors. Gold is common in academic caps, but in
[Oxford](Oxford_University "wikilink") and some other institutions a
black ribbon is traditional.

In many educational institutions it is traditional for [faculty
members](faculty_(division) "wikilink") to wear a soft
[tam](Tam_o'_shanter_(cap) "wikilink") or traditional
[mortarboard](mortarboard "wikilink") instead. The
[biretta](biretta "wikilink") also sometimes appears among holders of
[theology](theology "wikilink") degrees or officers at religious
institutions.
