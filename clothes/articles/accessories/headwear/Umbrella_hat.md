An **umbrella hat** is an umbrella canopy attached to a headband that
functions as a protection against the drizzle rain or sun. It is seen as
a novelty item.

## Description

Umbrella hats have a typical umbrella canopy, with ribs supporting a
fabric or plastic covering. This canopy is connected to a headband via
four short shafts on every other rib to keep the canopy over the head.
The canopy is generally collapsible, with the ribs and fabric collapsing
around the headband shafts, much like a typical
[umbrella](umbrella "wikilink"). Umbrella hats can come in a wide array
of colors, and sizes, including national flags like the British Flag.

## History

, known as the Umbrella Man in Seattle, Washington, and San Jose,
California.\]\] In December 1880, there was a patent taken out on the
umbrella hat, patent 250,803.

[Robert W. Patten](Robert_W._Patten "wikilink") claimed that he invented
the umbrella hat while he was [prospecting](prospecting "wikilink") in
Mexico. His original hat also included a [mosquito
net](mosquito_net "wikilink") attached to the canopy. Patten moved to
Seattle in the 1890s and was dubbed the *Umbrella Man*. He then became a
repairman for umbrellas, and inspired a cartoon from [John
Hager](John_Hager_(cartoonist) "wikilink"), depicting Robert Patten with
his umbrella hat. Patten was seen as eccentric, and Hager's cartoons of
him were comic.

American baseball Hall of Famer [Lou Brock](Lou_Brock "wikilink") was an
aficionado and promoted and sold a version called the "brockabrella,"
giving the device a bit of popularity in [St.
Louis](St._Louis,_Missouri "wikilink") in the mid 20th century.

Today, the umbrella hat has advanced considerably. It is often
associated as a cheap and comical novelty item, but it can be used to
shield a person against rain or sunshine hands-free. Umbrella Hats are
particularly useful to wheelchair users who need the use of both hands
in the rain. It is also useful for gardeners, cyclists, walkers,
shoppers, hunters, fishers, political canvassers and general manual
laborers.Black umbrella man.
