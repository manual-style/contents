An **ushanka** ( , ), also called an *ushanka-[hat](hat "wikilink")* (
), is a Russian [fur](fur_clothing "wikilink") [cap](cap "wikilink")
with ear flaps that can be tied up to the
[crown](crown_(anatomy) "wikilink") of the cap, or fastened at the chin
to protect the ears, jaw, and lower chin from the cold. An alternative
is to bend the flaps back and tie them behind the head, which is called
"[ski](ski "wikilink")-style" — this offers less protection from the
elements, but much better visibility, essential for high-speed skiing.
The dense fur also offers some protection against blunt impacts to the
head.

The word *ushanka* derives from *ushi* (у́ши), "ears" in Russian, but
also in many [Slavic languages](Slavic_languages "wikilink") as well.

## Basic materials

Ushankas are often made from inexpensive
[sheepskin](sheepskin "wikilink") (*tsigeyka*,
[:ru:Цигейка](:ru:Цигейка "wikilink")), [rabbit](rabbit "wikilink") or
[muskrat](muskrat "wikilink") fur. [Artificial
fur](Artificial_fur "wikilink") hats are also manufactured and are
referred to as "[fish fur](fish_fur "wikilink")" since the material is
not from any real animal. The simplest "fish fur" of *ushanka*s was made
of [wool](wool "wikilink") [pile](pile_(textile) "wikilink") with cloth
substrate and cloth top, with the exception of the flaps, which had the
pile exposed. Mink fur ushankas are widely used in the Arctic regions of
Russia, protecting the ears and chin of the wearer even from "deep
frost", which is around .

## History

Hats with fur earflaps have been known for centuries, especially in the
[Slavic](Slavs "wikilink") [Balkan](Balkans "wikilink") countries
Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, as well as in Northeastern
[Italy](Italy "wikilink"), in the [Julian
March](Julian_March "wikilink"), [Trieste](Trieste "wikilink"), and
surrounding areas where there has been a large Slavic population for
centuries. Such hats are also seen in
[Scandinavian](Scandinavia "wikilink") countries Sweden and Norway, in
the [Eurasian](Eurasia "wikilink") and
[European](Central_Europe "wikilink") Slavic countries Russia, Ukraine,
Slovenia, and in [Caucasus](Caucasus "wikilink") region in Georgia and
Armenia. The design of ushanka with a perfectly round
[crown](hat#Hat_design "wikilink") was developed in the 17th century
when in [central](Central_Russia "wikilink") and
[northern](Russian_North "wikilink") Russia a hat with earflaps called
[treukh](treukh "wikilink") was worn. The modern ushanka design from
1917 is also inspired by the Norwegian *norvezhka*, a hat which was
invented by Norwegian arctic explorers. The main difference from the
treukh is that the earflaps of the norvezhka were much longer. In
addition, [Russian Cossacks](Cossacks "wikilink") of the
[Kuban](Kuban_Cossacks "wikilink") have influenced the design of modern
Ushanka through interaction with peoples from [Central
Asia](Central_Asia "wikilink") and [Caucasus](Caucasus "wikilink").

In 1917 During the [Russian Civil War](Russian_Civil_War "wikilink"),
the ruler of [Siberia](Siberia "wikilink"), [Aleksandr
Kolchak](Aleksandr_Kolchak "wikilink"), introduced a winter uniform hat,
commonly referred to as a *kolchakovka*, c. 1918. It was similar to the
ushanka. In 1933, [W. C. Fields](W._C._Fields "wikilink") wore a
kolchakovka in the short film *[The Fatal Glass of
Beer](The_Fatal_Glass_of_Beer_(1933_film) "wikilink")*. However, Kolchak
and the [White Army](White_Army "wikilink") lost the war, and their
headgear was not adopted in the new [Soviet
Union](Soviet_Union "wikilink").

Red Army soldiers instead wore the [budenovka](budenovka "wikilink"),
which was made of felt. It was designed to resemble historical
[bogatyr](bogatyr "wikilink") helmets, and did not provide much
protection from the cold.

During the [Winter War](Winter_War "wikilink") against Finland,
organizational failures and inadequate equipment left many Soviet troops
vulnerable to cold, and many died of exposure. The [Finnish
army](Finnish_army "wikilink") had much better equipment including an
ushanka-style fur hat, the turkislakki M36, introduced in 1936. In 1939,
shortly before the Winter War, the slightly improved turkislakki M39 was
introduced, and is still in use today. After the winter war, the [Red
Army](Red_Army "wikilink") received completely redesigned winter
uniforms. *[Budenovkas](Budenovka "wikilink")* were finally replaced
with ushankas based on the Finnish example. Officers were issued fur
ushankas; other ranks received ushankas made with
[plush](plush "wikilink") or "[fish fur](fish_fur "wikilink")". When
they experienced the harsh Russian winter, for example during the
[Battle of Moscow](Battle_of_Moscow "wikilink"), German soldiers started
to wear ushankas and other Soviet-type winter gear, as their uniforms
did not provide adequate protection. WW2 ushanka presented in the Army
museum (Russia) and Saumur tank museum (France).

The ushanka became a symbol and media icon of the [Soviet
Union](Soviet_Union "wikilink") and later the [Russian
Federation](Russian_Federation "wikilink"). Photographs of U.S.
President [Gerald Ford](Gerald_Ford "wikilink") wearing the cap during a
1974 visit to the Soviet Union were seen as a possible sign of
[détente](détente "wikilink").

I](SALT_I "wikilink") talks

## Current use

Identified with Soviet rule and issued in all [Warsaw
Pact](Warsaw_Pact "wikilink") armies, the ushanka has become a part of
the winter uniform for military and police forces in Canada and other
Western countries with a cold winter. Gray (American civilian police),
green (for camouflage), blue (police, United States Post Office) and
black versions are in current usage. In 2013, the Russian army announced
that the ushanka was being replaced by new headgear, which is
essentially the same ushanka with a rounder crown and small sealable
openings in the flaps for wearing [headphones](headphones "wikilink").

The ushanka was used by the East German authorities before [German
reunification](German_reunification "wikilink"), and remained part of
the German police uniform in winter afterwards. In the [Finnish Defence
Forces](Finnish_Defence_Forces "wikilink"), a gray hat is used with M62
uniform and a green one of different design is a part of M91 and M05
winter dress. Armoured troops have a black hat (M92), while generals may
wear a white M39 hat. The [Royal Canadian Mounted
Police](Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police "wikilink") use a "regulation hat"
(between an ushanka and an [aviator hat](aviator_hat "wikilink")), made
of [muskrat](muskrat "wikilink") fur. This replaced the former
[Astrakhan (hat)](Canadian_military_fur_wedge_cap "wikilink"). Similar
ones are used by [Toronto Transit
Commission](Toronto_Transit_Commission "wikilink") staff during winter.

A similar type of headgear is worn in China's [People's Liberation
Army](People's_Liberation_Army "wikilink")'s winter uniform. Featured in
an iconic image of [Lei Feng](Lei_Feng "wikilink"), this type of hat is
often called by Chinese "the Lei Feng hat" (雷锋帽, *Lei Feng mao*).

It is claimed that British wartime airmen visiting the [Kola
Inlet](Kola_Inlet "wikilink") to help to protect the [Arctic
convoys](Arctic_convoys "wikilink") quickly started to wear ushankas
because their own uniform hats were not warm enough, but "kept the ear
flaps tied up to the crown as any Russian would, because it was
considered unmanly to wear them down." However, in the Russian military
up to this day, the way of wearing the ushanka — up flaps, down flaps or
ski-style — is considered a part of [uniform of the
day](uniform_of_the_day "wikilink") and is usually decided by a unit
commander at [reveille](reveille "wikilink"), so the Russian soldiers
aren't actually free about the way they wear their hats.

A variant of the ushanka is popular in Norway, especially in the north.
It is infamous for its name, "bjørnefitte" (bear's vagina), which is
considered vulgar in most parts of the country.

## Similar hats

[Trapper hats](Trapper_hat "wikilink") are "a sort of hybrid between the
aviator cap and the ushanka—they combine the style of the former with
the furriness of the latter". They are considered more casual than the
military-derived ushanka.
