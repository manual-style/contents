The **zucchetto** ( , also , , ; meaning "small
[gourd](gourd "wikilink")", from *zucca*,
"[pumpkin](pumpkin "wikilink")") is a small, hemispherical, form-fitting
ecclesiastical [skullcap](cap "wikilink") worn by
[clerics](clergy "wikilink") of various [Catholic
churches](Catholic_church "wikilink"), the [Syriac Orthodox
Church](Syriac_Orthodox_Church "wikilink"), and by the higher clergy in
[Anglicanism](Anglicanism "wikilink"). The plural is *zucchetti*; it is
also known by the names **pilus**, **pilos**, **pileus**, **pileolus**
(*pileolo*), **subbiretum**, **submitrale**, **soli deo** (*solideo*),
**berrettino**, **calotte** (*calotta*).

## History

The zucchetto originated as the Greek *[pilos](Pileus_(hat) "wikilink")*
and is related to the [beret](beret "wikilink") (which itself was
originally a large zucchetto). It was adopted circa the [Early Middle
Ages](Early_Middle_Ages "wikilink"), if not earlier, to keep clerics'
heads warm. Its name derives from its resemblance to half a
[pumpkin](pumpkin "wikilink"). Its appearance is almost identical to the
Jewish [kippah](kippah "wikilink") (yarmulke), and this is often
considered to have been deliberate (as a reminder of
[Jesus](Jesus "wikilink")'s Jewish heritage), though its religious
significance is ultimately quite different regardless.

## Construction and design

In the Catholic tradition, the zucchetto is most commonly made of silk
or polyester fabric. The design utilises eight triangular panels that
are joined to form a hemispherical skullcap. Jutting from the centre of
the zucchetto at the top is the "stem", known as *stirpis* or *stirpes*.
It is made of a twisted loop of silk cord and is meant to make the
handling of the zucchetto easier. The *stirpes* is the primary visual
distinction between the zucchetto and the Jewish kippah.

The zucchetto has a lining of thin leather
([chamois](Chamois_leather "wikilink")) as an insulator; this was also
meant to help keep the shape of the zucchetto. Inside the trim there is
a strip of velvet to ensure a secure and comfortable fit. Most modern
zucchetto designs include a cloth lining, and the modern trend is toward
a zucchetto of ordinary synthetic cloth lined with a simple natural
cloth lining.

The color of the zucchetto specifically denotes the wearer's rank and is
in keeping with the five colors:

-   the [pope's](Pope "wikilink") zucchetto is
    [white](white "wikilink");
-   those worn by [cardinals](Cardinal_(Catholic_Church) "wikilink") are
    [scarlet](scarlet_(color) "wikilink");
-   those of [archbishops](archbishop "wikilink"),
    [bishops](Bishop_in_the_Catholic_Church "wikilink"), [territorial
    abbots](Territorial_abbey "wikilink") and [territorial
    prelates](territorial_prelate "wikilink") are
    [amaranth](Amaranth_(color) "wikilink");
-   and [priests](Priesthood_in_the_Catholic_Church "wikilink") and
    [deacons](deacon "wikilink") wear a [black](black "wikilink")
    zucchetto.

The use of the black zucchetto by priests and deacons is generally
uncommon and widely considered an eccentricity. Some friar-preachers
have adopted the practice of wearing a brown zucchetto to match their
brown habit. The [pope](pope "wikilink") customarily wears a white
zucchetto to match his white cassock.

The most common [Anglican](Anglican "wikilink") design can be similar to
the Catholic zucchetto or, far more often, similar to the Jewish
yarmulke. A form of the zucchetto is worn by
[Anglican](Anglican "wikilink") bishops and is used approximately like
that of the Catholic Church. The Anglican "skullcap" differs from the
zucchetto primarily in that it is made of six panels, bears a button at
centre of the crown, and is of slightly larger dimensions. The other
exception is Anglican churches usually (but not always) differ from the
Catholic "church violet" for bishops, and instead use
[purple](purple "wikilink").

In the Syriac and Malankara Orthodox tradition, a seven-panel zucchetto
called a *phiro* is worn by nearly all priests. It is always black and
embroidered with black Orthodox crosses.

## Usage

All ordained members of the [Latin Church](Latin_Church "wikilink") of
the Catholic Church are entitled to wear the black zucchetto (unless
promoted to a higher rank) which is worn with either the
[cassock](cassock "wikilink") or ceremonial robes. The zucchetto is
always worn beneath the [mitre](mitre "wikilink") or the
[biretta](biretta "wikilink"). This is the reason for two of the
alternate names for the zucchetto, *subbirettum* and *submitrale*. The
zucchetto is never worn with a suit. The amaranth and red zucchetti are
considered a symbolic honor granted to the prelate. In turn, the prelate
is *privileged* to wear his zucchetto, not entitled.

The common tradition is for the cleric to obtain the zucchetto either
from an ecclesiastical tailor or a retail church supply. There is also a
tradition of friends buying the newly appointed bishop his first
zucchetto.

A lower-ranking prelate must always [doff](wikt:doff "wikilink") his
skullcap to a higher-ranking prelate; all prelates must remove their
zucchetti in the presence of the pope, unless the pope instructs them
not to do so.

The zucchetto is worn throughout most of the
[Mass](Mass_(liturgy) "wikilink"), is removed at the commencement of the
[Preface](Preface_(liturgy) "wikilink"), and replaced at the conclusion
of [Communion](Liturgy_of_the_Eucharist "wikilink"), when the [Blessed
Sacrament](Blessed_Sacrament "wikilink") is put away. The zucchetto is
also not worn at any occasion where the Blessed Sacrament is exposed. A
short zucchetto stand known as a *[funghellino](funghellino "wikilink")*
("little mushroom", usually made of [brass](brass "wikilink") or
[wood](wood "wikilink")) is placed near the altar to provide a safe
place for the zucchetto when it is not being worn.

Prelates often give away their skullcaps to the faithful. The practice,
which was started in the modern era by [Pope Pius
XII](Pope_Pius_XII "wikilink"), involves giving the zucchetto to the
faithful, as a [keepsake](souvenir "wikilink"), if presented with a new
one as a gift. Popes [John Paul II](Pope_John_Paul_II "wikilink"),
[Benedict XVI](Pope_Benedict_XVI "wikilink"), and
[Francis](Pope_Francis "wikilink") have continued the custom. The pope
might choose not to give the visitor his own zucchetto, but rather place
the gift zucchetto on his head for a moment as a blessing, then return
it. Bishops, cardinals and archbishops such as [Fulton J.
Sheen](Fulton_J._Sheen "wikilink") frequently gave their old zucchetto
in exchange for the newly offered one; Sheen also gave his zucchetto as
a keepsake to laity who requested it.
