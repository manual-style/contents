A **brooch** /ˈbroʊtʃ/ is a decorative jewelry item designed to be
attached to garments, often to hold them closed. It is usually made of
metal, often silver or gold or some other material. Brooches are
frequently decorated with enamel or with gemstones and may be solely for
ornament or serve a practical function as a clothes fastener. The
earliest known brooches are from the Bronze Age. As fashions in brooches
changed rather quickly, they are important chronological indicators.
Many of the ancient European brooches found in archaeology are usually
referred to by the Latin term fibula.
