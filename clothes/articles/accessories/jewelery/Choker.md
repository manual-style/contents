A **choker** is a close-fitting necklace worn around the neck. Chokers
can be made of a variety of materials, including velvet, plastic, beads,
latex, leather, metal, such as silver, gold or platinum, etc. They can
be adorned in a variety of ways, including with sequins, studs, or a
pendant.

In recent years, chokers have been popular with a number of celebrities
including Gwyneth Paltrow who wore one to the 1999 Academy Awards. Paris
Hilton wore three inches of Swarovski around her neck in 2002. Rihanna
has also been featured wearing chokers.

In the 2010s, the choker has become a popular fashion symbol among
transgender women, due not only to its association with femininity, but
also because of its potential to hide the Adam's apple without
performing a tracheal shave.
