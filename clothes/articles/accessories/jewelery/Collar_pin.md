pin.](/File:Brearley,_Norman_(1920s).jpg "wikilink") A **collar pin**
(closely related to the **collar bar** and **collar clip**) is a piece
of men's jewelry, which holds the two ends of a [dress
shirt](/dress_shirt "wikilink") [collar](/collar_(clothing) "wikilink")
together and passes underneath the
[knot](/Necktie#Types_of_knots "wikilink") of a
[necktie](/necktie "wikilink"). Functioning in a similar way as a
[tabbed collar](/Dress_shirt#Collars "wikilink"), it keeps the collar in
place and lifts the knot to provide a more aesthetically pleasing arc to
the necktie.

A collar pin is between three and five centimeters in length and is one
of three kinds:

-   a collar bar or barbell whose ends screw off and is designed to pass
    through specially made [eyelets](/eyelet "wikilink") in each side of
    the collar
-   a pin, similar to a [safety pin](/safety_pin "wikilink"), that
    pierces each side of the collar (or passes through the existing
    eyelet)
-   a bar with clips on both ends that grasp each side of the collar

The latter two styles do not require specially made collars, but collar
bars are generally not worn with buttoned-down ("polo") collars and
would be redundant with tabbed collars. [Collar
stays](/Collar_stays "wikilink") are not needed when using a collar bar.
As a general matter, collar pins work best with straight, minimally
spread collars; least, if at all, with spread collars; and not at all
with widely spread collars such as the cutaway.
