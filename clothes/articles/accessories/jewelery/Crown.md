A **crown** is a traditional symbolic form of head adornment worn by a
monarch or by a deity (as distinct from a hat), for whom the crown
traditionally represents power, legitimacy, victory, triumph, honor, and
glory, as well as immortality, righteousness, and resurrection. In art,
the crown may be shown being offered to those on Earth by angels. Apart
from the traditional form,<sup>\[*clarification\ needed*\]</sup> crowns
also may be in the form of a wreath and be made of flowers, oak leaves,
or thorns and be worn by others, representing what the coronation part
aims to symbolize with the specific crown. In religious art, a crown of
stars is used similarly to a halo. Crowns worn by rulers often contain
jewels.

A crown is often an emblem of the monarchy, a monarch's government, or
items endorsed by it. The word itself is used, particularly in
Commonwealth countries, as an abstract name for the monarchy itself, as
distinct from the individual who inhabits it (see The Crown).
