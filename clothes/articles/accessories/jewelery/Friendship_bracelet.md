A **friendship bracelet** is a decorative bracelet given by one person
to another as a symbol of friendship. Friendship bracelets are often
handmade, usually of embroidery floss or thread and are a type of
macrame. There are various styles and patterns, but most are based on
the same simple half-hitch knot. They resemble a friendship that is
strong and everlasting. If one were to remove the bracelet it resembles
that the friendship has ended. (over) The only proper way for a bracelet
to come off is by natural wear and tear and to eventually fray enough to
fall of.

The amount of thread used in bracelets varies depending on the pattern.
The smallest pattern, a double chain knot, requires two strings while
the candy stripe can have as 3 or more strings depending on the desired
thickness.

Friendship bracelets first became popular in the United States during
the 1970s. As they are unisex, they are commonly worn by both male and
female teenagers and children. They are now popular throughout the world
and are not only popular among teenagers but among the older generation;
they are popular among celebrities as well. Friendship bracelets can be
worn on various occasions; for example, they are ideal as a fashion
accessory at the beach because they are made of materials that will not
be easily destroyed and with which one can swim freely.

## History\[edit\]

Friendship bracelets are ancient, but their resurgence is modern. The
modern popularity of friendship bracelets started in the 1980s when they
were seen during protests about the disappearances of Mayan Indians and
peasants in Guatemala. The friendship bracelets were brought into the
United States by religious groups for use in political rallies.

Friendship bracelets can have many meanings and symbolic uses, such as
friendship, folk art, or social statements. Although it is generally
accepted that the origins of these colorful bands lie with the Indians
in Central and South America, some decorative knots can be traced back
to China from 481 to 221 B.C. According to tradition, one ties a
bracelet onto the wrist of a friend as a symbol of friendship and may
wish for something at that moment. The bracelet should be worn until it
is totally worn out and falls off by itself to honour the hard work and
love put into making it. The moment at which the band falls off on its
own, the wish is supposed to come true.
