A **lanyard** is a cord or strap worn around the neck, shoulder, or
wrist to carry such items as keys or identification cards. In the
military, lanyards were used to fire an artillery piece or arm the fuze
mechanism on an air-dropped bomb by pulling out a cotter pin (thereby
starting the arming delay) when it leaves the aircraft. They are also
used to attach a pistol to a body so that it can be dropped without
being lost. Aboard a ship, it may refer to a piece of rigging used to
secure or lower objects.

The style, design or material used will vary depending on end-purpose of
the lanyard. Lanyard materials include polyester, nylon, satin, silk,
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), braided leather or braided paracord.
