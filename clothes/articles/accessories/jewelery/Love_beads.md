**Love beads** are one of the traditional accessories of hippies. They
consist of one or more long strings of beads, frequently handmade, worn
around the neck by both sexes. The love bead trend probably evolved from
the hippie fascination with non-Western cultures, such as those of
Africa, India, and Native America, which make common use of similar
beads.

homes, we smoked pot, wore dashikis and love beads, and frugged

...", Janet Jackson, "70s Love Groove"
