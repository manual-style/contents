**Prayer beads** are bands or loops used by members of various religious
traditions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism and
the Bahá'í Faith to mark the repetitions of prayers, chants or
devotions, such as the rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Catholicism,
and dhikr (remembrance of God) in Islam.

Since the beads are fingered in an automatic manner, they allow the user
to keep track of how many prayers have been said with a minimal amount
of conscious effort, which in turn allows greater attention to be paid
to the prayers themselves.
