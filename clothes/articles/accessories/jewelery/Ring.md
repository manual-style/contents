A **ring** is a round band, usually of metal, worn as ornamental
jewelry. The term "ring" by itself always denotes the finger ring, but
when worn as an ornament elsewhere, the body part is always specified,
e.g. earrings, neck rings, arm rings, and toe rings. Rings always fit
snugly around or in the part of the body they ornament, so bands worn
loosely, like a bracelet, are not rings. Rings may be made of almost any
hard material: wood, bone, stone, metal, glass, gemstone or plastic.
They may be set with gemstones (diamond, ruby, sapphire or emerald) or
with other types of stone or glass.

Although people wear some rings as mere ornaments, or as conspicuous
displays of wealth, rings have symbolic functions in relation to
marriage, exceptional achievement, high status or authority, membership
in an organization, and the like. Rings can be made to sport insignia to
be transferred in an impression in a wax seal, or outfitted with a small
compartment in which to conceal things. In myth, fable, and fiction,
rings are often endowed with spiritual or supernatural significance.

## History

The parts of a ring: 1) hoop, 2) shoulder, 3) bezel, and 4) stone or gem
in setting or mounting

### Ancient India

Along with the rings, other types of jewelleries including necklace,
rings, bracelets, earrings, bangles, pendants, and others have been
discovered from 3rd millennium BC civilization Indus Valley
Civilization. Factories of small beads have been discovered in Lothal,
India.

### Ancient Near East

Finger rings have been found in tombs in Ur dating back to circa 2500BC.
The Hittite civilization produced rings, including signet rings, only a
few of which have been discovered. People in Old Kingdom Egypt wore a
variety of finger rings, of which a few examples have been found,
including the famous scarab design. Rings became more common during the
Egyptian middle kingdom, with increasingly complex designs. Egyptians
made metal rings but also made rings from faience some of which were
used as new year gifts. Native styles were superseded by Greek and Roman
fashions during the Ptolemaic dynasty.

### Archaic and classical Greek

Archaic Greek rings were to some extent influenced by Egyptian rings,
although they tended to be less substantial and were not for the most
part used as working signet rings. A lack of locally available gold
meant that rings made in the eastern colonies tended to be made from
silver and bronze while Etruria used gold.

The classical period showed a shift away from bronze to wider adoption
of silver and gold. The most typical design of the period involved a
lozenge bezel mounting an intaglio device. Over time the bezel moved
towards a more circular form.

### Roman Rings

Henig II rings from the Snettisham Jeweller's Hoard

During the early and middle imperial era (first two centuries AD) the
closest there is to a typical Roman ring consisted of a thick hoop that
tapered directly into a slightly wider bezel. An engraved oval gem would
be embedded within the bezel with the top of the gem only rising
slightly above the surrounding ring material. Such rings are referred to
Henig II and III/Guiraud 2 in formal academic parlance or simply as
Roman rings by modern jewellers. In general Roman rings became more
elaborate in the third and fourth centuries AD.

### High and late middle ages in Europe

During this period the fashion was for multiple rings on each hand and
on each finger. Rings during this period were mostly made from copper
based alloys, silver or gold. Gems became common after 1150 along with
the belief that certain gems had the power to help or protect the wearer
in various ways. Engraved rings were produced using Lombardic script
until around 1350 when it was replaced by Gothic script. Some of the
inscriptions were devotional, others romantic in nature. For romantic
inscriptions French was the language of choice. An increasing use of
contracts and other documents that needed to have formal seals meant
that signet rings became more important from the 13th century onwards.

## Ring location

Each finger has had a symbolic association or meaning (most lost in
antiquity and that may vary from culture to culture) for the placement
of a ring as a sign to observers.

The fourth digit or ring finger of the left hand has become the
customary place to wear betrothal, engagement and wedding rings in much
of the world, though in certain countries the right hand finger is used.
This custom was practically established as the norm during World War II.

The use of the fourth finger of the left hand (the 'ring finger') is
associated with an old belief that the left hand's ring finger is
connected by a vein directly to the heart: the *vena amoris* or vein of
love. This idea was known in 16th and 17th century England, when Henry
Swinburne referred to it in his book about marriage. It can be traced
back to ancient Rome, when Aulus Gellius cited Appianus as saying the
ancient Egyptians had found a fine nerve linking that particular finger
to the heart.

The Ring of O in its current most common shape; it is worn by some BDSM
practitioners, who sometimes indicate by the hand they wear it on
whether they are a Top or a Bottom; usually left for Bottom, right for
Top.

The Ring of O is a specially designed ring which has been worn as a
distinctive mark among BDSM practitioners, mainly in continental Europe
— and especially the German-speaking countries — since the 1990s. Its
use is relatively widespread within this subculture. Its name derives
from the name of the central female character in the classic BDSM novel
*Story of O* (written by Anne Desclos), who was a sex slave and wore an
analogous ring. The ring mentioned in the original novel was quite
different from what is most commonly known as the "Ring of O" today. The
novel describes the ring as shaped similarly to a signet ring (with a
seal disk on top which was relatively large for a woman's ring), made
out of dull-gray polished iron, lined with gold on the inside, and with
a golden Triskelion on its top area. The ring's symbolic meaning in the
novel also differs quite a bit from the one commonly used among BDSM
practitioners today. In the book, such a ring is worn by a female
"slave" after she has finished her training at Roissy. Those wearing the
ring are obliged to be obedient to any man who belongs to the secret
society of Roissy (whose emblem is the triskelion), and must allow him
to do absolutely everything with them that he pleases. This stands in
strong contrast to the ring's meaning today. People indicate by wearing
such rings that they are interested in BDSM, and sometimes by the hand
they wear it on whether they are a Top or a Bottom; usually left for
Bottom, right for Top.

Occasionally rings have been re-purposed to hang from bracelets or
necklaces.

The signet ring is traditionally worn on the left pinky or little
finger.

A birthstone ring and/or "birthday" stone ring is customarily worn on
the first finger of the right hand and indicates respectively the month
and day of the week in and on which the bearer was born.

Amulet rings, worn for a plethora of purposes from protection (pentacle
rings) to augmenting personal attributes (wisdom, confidence, social
status etc.) are worn on various fingers often depending on the intent
of the ring's design or attributes of the stone inset. Although it has
been thought that worn on specific fingers for specific purpose enhanced
their powers, most people simply wear them on any finger of which they
fit.

Thumb rings were originally worn to protect the thumb from injuries
caused by the launching of arrows and are a sign of an archer.

## Size

Main article: Ring size

While the ISO standard defines ring size in terms of the inner
circumference in millimeters various countries have traditional sizing
systems that are still used. Sizing beads functionally reduce the ring
size and are small metal beads added to the inner surface of a ring to
hold it in place against the finger; they have the advantage of being
easily added or removed.

## Styles

After several thousand years of ring manufacture the total number of
styles produced is vast. Even cataloging the rings of a single
civilization such as the Romans presents a major challenge. As a result,
the following list should be considered to be very limited.

| Ring                                   | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Aqiq ring                              | A carnelian or agate ring worn by some Muslims in imitation of Muhammad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Birthstones ring                       | Usually a slender, simple ring (sometimes consisting of a band), set with the wearer's birthstone, or the birthstone of the wearer's spouse. Those like the Mother's ring can be worn set with various birthstones. Some couples wear birthstones set with a wedding anniversary month birthstone as well as other commemorative stones.                                                                                                                                   |
| Cameo (carving) ring                   | A plain hoop mounted by a table setting, into which is affixed a carved cameo. This ring style is exceedingly ancient and was more commonly worn by men than by women. Ancient cameos depicted pagan gods, Christian saints and even self-portraits.

| Class ring                             | Worn by students and alumni in commemoration of their graduation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Cocktail ring                          | An oversized ladies' ring with a large center stone often surrounded by tiny stones. Nearly any oversized ladies' ring may be termed "cocktail". This is the most common type of costume jewellery ring and is also known as a *cluster ring* and *dinner ring*.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Guard ring (a.k.a. ring-guard)         | is a slender, slightly tighter-fitting ring designed to be placed on the finger after a large/loose ring, to prevent slippage and ring loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Iron Ring, and Engineer's Ring         | Ring worn by American and Canadian engineers, after swearing the Engineer's Oath.
