A **tiara** (from Latin: *tiara*, from Ancient Greek: τιάρα) is a
jeweled, ornamental crown traditionally worn by women. It is worn during
formal occasions, particularly if the dress code is white tie.

Tiaras made of plastic, rhinestones, Swarovski crystals, or any other
non-precious material are considered costume jewelry. They are worn by
women on special occasions such as homecoming or prom and at their
quinceañera (fifteenth birthday) or wedding. They are also worn by the
winners of beauty pageants and girls dressing up as Disney princesses.

### Stage and screen

Tiaras are often worn by actresses in film, plays, and television. In
2013, Cartier created a replica of the ruby and diamond tiara they had
originally made in 1956 for Princess Grace of Monaco for the film,
*Grace of Monaco* starring Nicole Kidman.
