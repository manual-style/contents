A **toe ring** is a ring made out of metals and non-metals worn on any
of the toes. The second toe of either foot is where they are worn most
commonly. This is because proportionately it is the longest toe and thus
the easiest toe to put a ring on and stay without being connected to
anything else. In most western countries they are a relatively new
fashion accessory, and typically have no symbolic meaning. They are
usually worn with barefoot sandals, anklets, bare feet or flip flops.

Like finger rings, toe rings come in many shapes and forms, from
intricately designed flowers embedded with jewels to simple bands.
Fitted toe rings are rings that are of one size, whereas adjustable toe
rings have a gap at the bottom so they can be easily made to fit snugly.
