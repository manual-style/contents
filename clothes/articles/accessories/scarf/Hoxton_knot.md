[thumb\|right](/File:Hoxton.jpg "wikilink") The **Hoxton knot**,[1]
**Chelsea knot**,[2] **French loop**,[3] **Parisian scarf knot**[4] or
**Snug Tug**[5] is a method of arranging a [scarf](/scarf "wikilink")
about the neck. The scarf is doubled back and placed around the neck.
The tails of the scarf are then pulled through the U-bend of the
doubling to secure them, as with a [cow hitch or lark's
head](/cow_hitch "wikilink").

The knot is popular with stylish men like [David
Beckham](/David_Beckham "wikilink") who frequent fashionable districts
of London such as [Hoxton](/Hoxton "wikilink") and
[Chelsea](/Chelsea,_London "wikilink").[6] The style is also commonly
used by [outside broadcasters](/outside_broadcasting "wikilink") from
the [BBC](/BBC "wikilink") as it is warm and tidy.[7] It may be
controversial though, as some commentators opine that knotting a scarf
is less manly than just draping it around the neck or throwing the ends
casually over the shoulder.[8]
