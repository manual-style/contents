The **keffiyeh** or **kufiya** ( **, meaning "from the city of
[Kufa](/Kufa "wikilink")"[1] (); plural **), also known as a **ghutrah**
(), **shemagh** ( **), **** (), **mashadah** (), **chafiye**, **dastmal
yazdi** (, *destmal yezdî*) or **cemedanî** (), is a traditional
[Arab](/Arab "wikilink") [headdress](/Headgear "wikilink"), or what is
sometimes called a habit, worn in the [Middle
East](/Middle_East "wikilink") with origins from the Fertile Crescent
(Iraq, the Levant, and Egypt) fashioned from a square
[scarf](/scarf "wikilink"), usually made of
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink").[2] It is commonly found in
[arid](/arid "wikilink") regions as it provides protection from
[sunburn](/sunburn "wikilink"), dust and sand. Toward the end of the
1980s, the keffiyeh became a [fashion
accessory](/fashion_accessory "wikilink") in the United States and,
during the 2000s, it became very popular among teenagers in [Tokyo,
Japan](/Tokyo,_Japan "wikilink"), where it is often worn with
[camouflage](/camouflage "wikilink")-style clothing.[3]

## Varieties and variations

During his sojourn with the [Marsh Arabs](/Marsh_Arabs "wikilink") of
Iraq, [Gavin Young](/Gavin_Young "wikilink") noted that the local
*[sayyids](/sayyid "wikilink")*—"venerated men accepted \[...\] as
descendants of the Prophet [Muhammad](/Muhammad "wikilink") and
[Ali](/Ali "wikilink") ibn Abi Talib"—wore dark green keffiyeh
(*cheffiyeh*) in contrast to the black-and-white checkered examples
typical of the area's inhabitants.[4]

Many [Palestinian](/Palestinian_people "wikilink") keffiyehs are a mix
of cotton and wool, which facilitates quick drying and, when desired,
keeping the wearer's head warm. The keffiyeh is usually folded in half
(into a triangle) and the fold worn across the forehead. Often, the
keffiyeh is held in place by a circlet of rope called an
*[agal](/Agal_(accessory) "wikilink")* (, **). Some wearers wrap the
keffiyeh into a [turban](/turban "wikilink"), while others wear it
loosely draped around the back and shoulders. A
*[taqiyah](/taqiyah_(cap) "wikilink")* is sometimes worn underneath the
keffiyeh; in the past, it has also been wrapped around the rim of a
[fez](/fez "wikilink"). The keffiyeh is almost always of white cotton
cloth, but many have a checkered pattern in red or black stitched into
them. The plain white keffiyeh is most popular in the [Arab states of
the Persian Gulf](/Arab_states_of_the_Persian_Gulf "wikilink")—in
[Kuwait](/Kuwait "wikilink") and [Bahrain](/Bahrain "wikilink") to the
exclusion of almost any other style. The keffiyeh is worn by men of all
ages, whether on the head or around the shoulders. [thumb\|Jewish rabbi

[habit](Sudra_(headdress) "wikilink")](/File:Mori_Yitzhak,_Chief_Rabbi_of_Yemen_(1902_-_1932).jpg "wikilink")
In [Jordan](/Jordan "wikilink"), the red-and-white keffiyeh is strongly
associated with the country and its heritage, because the red color was
introduced into the Keffiyeh by the Jordanian Bedouins under British
rule , where it is known as the *shemagh mhadab*. The Jordanian keffiyeh
has decorative cotton or wool tassels on the sides; the bigger these
tassels, the greater the garment's supposed value and the status of the
person wearing it. It has long been worn by
[Bedouins](/Bedouin "wikilink") and villagers and used as a symbol of
honor and/or [tribal](/tribal "wikilink") identification. The tasseled
red-and-white Jordanian *shemagh* is much thicker than the untasseled
red-and-white shemagh seen in Persian Gulf countries.

In [Egypt](/Egypt "wikilink"), the keffiyeh and the
[agal](/Agal_(accessory) "wikilink") is worn by Bedouins specially in
the [Sinai Peninsula](/Sinai_Peninsula "wikilink"). It is also sometimes
tied into a turban in varying styles.

In Yemen, the keffiyeh is used extensively in both red-white and
black-white pattern. It spread during 1948 through Palestinian refugees.

In [Malaysia](/Malaysia "wikilink"), the keffiyeh has been worn by
Muslim women as part of [hijab](/hijab "wikilink") fashion and during
the Palestinian struggle against [Israel](/Israel "wikilink"). Many
Malaysians wore it to show solidarity for Palestine.

Also in [Indonesia](/Indonesia "wikilink") the people used the keffiyeh
to show their solidarity with the
[Palestinians](/Palestinians "wikilink").[5]

In [Turkey](/Turkey "wikilink") it was forbidden to wear a keffiyeh
because it was seen as evidence of support of the
[PKK](/Kurdistan_Workers'_Party "wikilink").[6]

The keffiyeh, especially the all-white keffiyeh, is also known as the
*ghutrah*. This is particularly common in the [Arabian
Peninsula](/Arabian_Peninsula "wikilink"), where the optional
[skullcap](/Headgear "wikilink") is called a keffiyeh. The garment is
also known in some areas as the **. Roughly speaking:

***Ordinary keffiyeh***

A piece of white/orange/black cloth made from wool and cotton, worn
primarily by Palestinians.

***Shalls/Musar***

A traditional scarf originated from Yemen, usually made of cotton or
flax and decorated with many colors, but usually red and white; worn
primarily by Yemen, & Oman.

***Shemagh***

A plain piece of cloth worn by the Arabian gulf.

***Dastmaal Yazdi***[thumb\|The King of Morocco wearing a
*rezzah*](/File:Embajador_en_Marruecos_presenta_cartas_credenciales_(9293623218).jpg "wikilink")

A traditional scarf in Iran, originally from the Yazd region of Iran.

***Chafiyeh***

A style of Keffiyeh that originated in Iran, based on the Iranian
Dastmaal Yazdi with influences from the Palestinian Keffiyeh. Often worn
by Shi'a Muslims in Iran as well as Iraq and Lebanon to express support
for Shi'a Political parties. The scarf gained popularity during the
Iran-Iraq war as a sign of Shi'a resistance against Saddam. The Chafiyeh
is also worn by Basij members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps,
Hezbollah, as well as occasionally by members of Iraq's Popular
Mobilization Forces, but also by ordinary Shia religious pilgrims not
affiliated with any political group.

***Ghutrah***

A piece of white cloth made of cotton mild, worn in western Iraq and by
the Arabs of the Arabian Gulf states.

***Rezza***

It is worn by inhabitants of [North Africa](/North_Africa "wikilink").

## Palestinian national symbol

Traditionally worn by Palestinian farmers, the keffiyeh became worn by
Palestinian men of any rank and became a symbol of Palestinian
nationalism during the [Arab
Revolt](/1936–1939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine "wikilink") of the
1930s.[7][8] Its prominence increased during the 1960s with the
beginning of the Palestinian resistance movement and its adoption by
Palestinian leader [Yasser Arafat](/Yasser_Arafat "wikilink").[9]

[thumb\|left\|[Yasser Arafat](Yasser_Arafat "wikilink") wearing his
iconic fishnet pattern keffiyeh in
1974](/File:Arafat_keffiyeh.JPG "wikilink")

The black-and-white fishnet pattern keffiyeh would later become Arafat's
iconic symbol, and he would rarely be seen without it; only occasionally
would he wear a military cap, or, in colder climates, a
[Russian](/Russia "wikilink")-style *[ushanka](/ushanka "wikilink")*
hat. Arafat would wear his keffiyeh in a semi-traditional way, wrapped
around his head via an *agal*. He also wore a similarly patterned piece
of cloth in the [neckline](/neckline "wikilink") of his [military
fatigues](/Battledress "wikilink"). Early on, he had made it his
personal trademark to drape the scarf over his right shoulder only,
arranging it in the rough shape of a [triangle](/triangle "wikilink"),
to resemble the outlines of historic
[Palestine](/Palestine_(region) "wikilink"). This way of wearing the
keffiyeh became a symbol of Arafat as a person and political leader, and
it has not been imitated by other Palestinian leaders.

Another Palestinian figure associated with the keffiyeh is [Leila
Khaled](/Leila_Khaled "wikilink"), a female member of the armed wing of
the [Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine](/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine "wikilink").
Several photographs of Khaled circulated in the Western newspapers after
the hijacking of [TWA Flight 840](/TWA_Flight_840_(1969) "wikilink") and
the [Dawson's Field hijackings](/Dawson's_Field_hijackings "wikilink").
These photos often included Khaled wearing a keffiyeh in the style of a
Muslim woman's [hijab](/hijab "wikilink"), wrapped around the head and
shoulders. This was unusual, as the keffiyeh is associated with Arab
masculinity, and many believe this to be something of a [fashion
statement](/fashion_statement "wikilink") by Khaled, denoting her
equality with men in the Palestinian armed struggle.

The colors of the stitching in a keffiyeh are also vaguely associated
with Palestinians' political sympathies. Traditional black and white
keffiyehs became associated with [Fatah](/Fatah "wikilink"). Later, red
and white keffiyehs were adopted by Palestinian Marxists, such as the
[PFLP](/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine "wikilink").[10]

The color symbolism of the scarves is by no means universally accepted
by all Palestinians or Arabs. Its importance should not be overstated,
as the scarves are used by Palestinians and Arabs of all political
affiliations, as well as by those with no particular political
sympathies.

### Symbol of Palestinian solidarity

The black and white chequered keffiyeh has become a symbol of
[Palestinian nationalism](/Palestinian_nationalism "wikilink"), dating
back to the [1936–1939 Arab revolt in
Palestine](/1936–1939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine "wikilink"). Outside of
the Middle East and North Africa, the keffiyeh first gained popularity
among activists supporting the Palestinians in the conflict with Israel.

The wearing of the keffiyeh often comes with criticism from various
political factions in the ongoing [Israeli–Palestinian
conflict](/Israeli–Palestinian_conflict "wikilink"). The slang "keffiyeh
kinderlach" refers to young Jews, particularly college students, who
sport a keffiyeh around the neck as a political/fashion statement. This
term may have first appeared in print in an article by [Bradley
Burston](/Bradley_Burston "wikilink") in which he writes of "the
suburban-exile kaffiyeh kinderlach of
[Berkeley](/University_of_California,_Berkeley "wikilink"), more
Palestinian by far than the Palestinians" in their criticism of Israel.
European activists have also worn the keffiyeh.[11][12]

While Western protesters wear differing styles and shades of keffiyeh,
the most prominent is the black-and-white keffiyeh. This is typically
worn around the neck like a [neckerchief](/neckerchief "wikilink"),
simply knotted in the front with the fabric allowed to drape over the
back. Other popular styles include rectangular-shaped scarves with the
basic black-and-white pattern in the body, with the ends knitted in the
form of the [Palestinian flag](/Palestinian_flag "wikilink"). Since the
[Al-Aqsa Intifada](/Second_Intifada "wikilink"), these rectangular
scarves have increasingly appeared with a combination of the Palestinian
flag and [Al-Aqsa Mosque](/Al-Aqsa_Mosque "wikilink") printed on the
ends of the fabric.

### Production

[thumb\|A loom at work making a traditional Palestinian keffiyeh in the
Hirbawi factory, Hebron, West
Bank](/File:Palestinian_keffiyeh_loom.jpg "wikilink")

Today, this symbol of Palestinian identity is now largely imported from
China. With the scarf's growing popularity in the 2000s, Chinese
manufacturers entered the market, driving Palestinians out of the
business.[13] In 2008, Yasser Hirbawi, who for five decades had been the
only Palestinian manufacturer of keffiyehs, is now struggling with
sales. *[Mother Jones](/Mother_Jones_(magazine) "wikilink")* wrote,
"Ironically, global support for
Palestinian-statehood-as-fashion-accessory has put yet another nail in
the coffin of the [Occupied
Territories](/Palestinian_territories "wikilink")' beleaguered
economy."[14]

## Westerners in keffiyeh

[thumb\|left\|[T. E. Lawrence](T._E._Lawrence "wikilink") at
[Rabegh](/Rabegh "wikilink"), north of [Jeddah](/Jeddah "wikilink"), in
1917](/File:Ljidda.jpg "wikilink")

British Colonel [T. E. Lawrence](/T._E._Lawrence "wikilink") (better
known as [Lawrence of Arabia](/Lawrence_of_Arabia "wikilink")) was
probably the best-known Western wearer of the keffiyeh. He wore a plain
white one with [agal](/Agal_(accessory) "wikilink") during his
involvement in the [Arab Revolt](/Arab_Revolt "wikilink") in [World War
I](/World_War_I "wikilink"). This image of Lawrence was later
popularized by the film epic about him, *[Lawrence of
Arabia](/Lawrence_of_Arabia_(film) "wikilink")*, in which he was played
by [Peter O'Toole](/Peter_O'Toole "wikilink").

The 1920s silent-film era of [American
cinema](/American_cinema "wikilink") saw studios take to
[Orientalist](/orientalism "wikilink") themes of the exotic Middle East,
possibly due to the view of Arabs as part of the [allies of World War
I](/allies_of_World_War_I "wikilink"), and keffiyehs became a standard
part of the theatrical wardrobe. These films and their male leads
typically had Western actors in the role of an Arab, often wearing the
keffiyeh with the agal (as with *[The
Sheik](/The_Sheik_(film) "wikilink")* and *[The Son of the
Sheik](/The_Son_of_the_Sheik "wikilink")*, starring actor [Rudolph
Valentino](/Rudolph_Valentino "wikilink")).

[Erwin Rommel](/Erwin_Rommel "wikilink") also commonly wore a keffiyeh
around his neck during the [Western Desert
Campaign](/Western_Desert_Campaign "wikilink") for practical reasons.

## Fashion trend

As with other articles of clothing worn in wartime, such as the
[T-shirt](/T-shirt "wikilink"), [fatigues](/Battledress "wikilink") and
[khaki](/khaki "wikilink") pants, the keffiyeh has been seen as chic
among non-Arabs in the West. Keffiyehs became popular in the United
States in the late 1980s, at the start of the [First
Intifada](/First_Intifada "wikilink"), when
[bohemian](/bohemian_style "wikilink") girls and
[punks](/Punk_subculture "wikilink") wore keffiyehs as
[scarves](/scarf "wikilink") around their necks.[15][16] In the early
2000s, keffiyehs were very popular among youths in
[Tokyo](/Tokyo "wikilink"), who often wore them with
[camouflage](/camouflage "wikilink") clothing.[17] The trend recurred in
the mid-2000s in the United States,[18][19]
[Europe](/Europe "wikilink"),[20] [Canada](/Canada "wikilink") and
[Australia](/Australia "wikilink"),[21][22] when the keffiyeh became
popular as a [fashion accessory](/fashion_accessory "wikilink"), usually
worn as a scarf around the neck in
[hipster](/hipster_(contemporary_subculture) "wikilink")
circles.[23][24] Stores such as [Urban
Outfitters](/Urban_Outfitters "wikilink") and
[TopShop](/TopShop "wikilink") stocked the item (after some controversy
over the retailer's decision to label the item "anti-war scarves,"
however, Urban Outfitters pulled it).[25] In spring 2008, keffiyehs in
colors like purple and mauve were given away in issues of fashion
magazines in Spain and France. In UAE, males are inclining towards more
western headgear while the women are developing preferences for
[dupatta](/dupatta "wikilink")—the traditional head cover of the Indian
subcontinent.[26] The appropriation of the keffiyeh as a fashion
statement by non-Arab wearers separate from its political and historical
meaning has been the subject of controversy in recent years. While it is
worn often as a symbol of solidarity with the Palestinian struggle, the
fashion industry has disregarded its significance by using its pattern
and style in day-to-day clothing design. For example, in 2016 Topshop
released a romper with the Keffiyeh print, calling it a "scarf
playsuit". This led to accusations of cultural appropriation and Topshop
eventually pulled the item from their website[27]
