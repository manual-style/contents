**Litham** (, sometimes pronounced **lifam**) is a
mouth-[veil](/veil "wikilink") which the [Tuareg](/Tuareg "wikilink")
and other [North African](/Berbers "wikilink") nomads, particularly men,
have traditionally used to cover the lower part of their face.[1]

## Role and significance

The litham has served as protection from the dust and extremes of
temperature characterizing the desert environment.[2] In cases of [blood
feuds](/Feud#Blood_feuds "wikilink"), it also served as protection
against violence by making the wearer difficult to recognize.[3] Wearing
of the litham is not viewed as a religious requirement, although it was
apparently believed to provide magical protection against evil
forces.[4] It is included among the garments which pilgrims are
forbidden to wear by the Islamic doctrine in the ritual state of
*[ihram](/ihram "wikilink")*.[5]

## History and practice

Ancient African rock engravings depicting human faces with eyes but no
mouth or nose suggest that the origins of litham are not only
pre-Islamic but even pre-historic.[6] The litham was commonly worn among
the Berber [Sanhaja](/Sanhaja "wikilink") tribes in north-west
Africa.[7] Its use by the [Almoravids](/Almoravids "wikilink"), who
originated from a Sanhaja clan, gave it a political significance during
their conquests in the 11th and 12th centuries.[8] This practice gave
rise to Almoravids being pejoratively nicknamed *al-mulaththamun* (the
muffled ones).[9] The [Almohads](/Almohads "wikilink"), who succeeded
the Almoravids as the dominant dynasty in the North African region,
opposed the practice of wearing the litham, claiming that it is
forbidden for men to imitate women's dress, but they never managed to
suppress its use.[10]

Among the [Tuareg](/Tuareg "wikilink"), men wear the litham, also called
*[tagelmust](/tagelmust "wikilink")*, while women go unveiled.[11]
Tuareg boys start wearing the litham at the onset of puberty and the
veil is regarded as a mark of manhood.[12] It is considered improper for
a man to appear unveiled in front of elders, especially those from his
wife's family.[13] The Tuareg litham is made of several pieces of
Sudanese cloth which are sewn together to yield a strip about four yards
long.[14]

## In literature and folklore

A number of legends were invented to explain the custom of male
veiling.[15] According to one, the wearers of litham descended from
members of the [Umayyad](/Umayyad "wikilink") family, who escaped to
Africa disguised as women after the fall of the Umayyad dynasty, and
never took off the veil.[16] When one fell in battle and lost his
litham, his friends could not recognize him until it was put back
on.[17] The word *litham* and its derivatives have been widely used in
Arabic literature, in particular by the poets, who commonly employed
puns between the general meaning of *litham* as veil and the verbal root
*lathama*, which means "to kiss".[18] In *[One Thousand and One
Nights](/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights "wikilink")* women use the litham
to disguise themselves as men.[19][20] The classical dictionary *Lisan
al-Arab* by [Ibn Manzur](/Ibn_Manzur "wikilink") treats *lifam* as a
separate word, describing it as a mouth veil worn by women.[21]
