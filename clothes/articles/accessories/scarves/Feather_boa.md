## Construction

A boa can be made of [fur](fur "wikilink"), but it is usually made
instead from various types of [feathers](feathers "wikilink"). Ostrich,
marabou, chandelle, and turkey are the most common feathers used,
although non-feather boas are also available. Feathers used go through
bleaching or dyeing processes and are glued and stitched into lengths
called "ply". Sometimes more natural boas are produced. A lightweight
chandelle boa might only weigh , whereas a 24 ply ostrich boa can weigh
as much as . The more ply, the fluffier and thicker the boa. Boas are
generally measured by weight (grams), length (centimetres), and ply.
Boas are available through novelty, costume, or lingerie shops, as well
as online.

the development of "fun fur" or "eyelash" yarns in the late 20th
century, an adept craftsperson can knit a boa of one solid color or a
mix of various colors. Yarn boas do not "shed" like feather boas and are
favored for their soft texture against the neck. The rounded boa shape
is achieved by knitting one row and purling the next row, then repeating
this pattern until reaching the desired length.

## Types

**[Ostrich](Ostrich "wikilink")** — Thousands of long thin feather
strands woven into ply are used to construct these very fluffy boas.
These form the larger, Las Vegas showgirl type boas, as when they are
coloured and woven into many ply, they can look very dramatic even at a
distance.

**[Turkey](Turkey_(bird) "wikilink")** — Many larger flat turkey
feathers form these heavier boas which might weigh between 120 and 400
grams and reach in diameter.

**[Marabou](Marabou_(fashion) "wikilink")** — The fine down from marabou
is used to form these very thin, and very fluffy boas.

**Chandelle** — Smaller feathers or "flats" from the turkey are used to
create these lighter boas with smaller diameters.
