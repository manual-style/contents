The ***focale***(plural*focalia*), also known as a***sudarium*** ("sweat
cloth"),[1] was a woolen or linen [scarf](scarf "wikilink") worn by
[ancient Roman military](Military_of_ancient_Rome "wikilink") personnel.
It protected the neck from chafing by the armor.[2] The *focale* is
depicted widely in military scenes from [Roman
art](Roman_art "wikilink"), such as the [relief
sculpture](relief_sculpture "wikilink") on the [Arch of Septimius
Severus](Arch_of_Septimius_Severus "wikilink") in the [Roman
Forum](Roman_Forum "wikilink")[3] and [Trajan's
Column](Trajan's_Column "wikilink").[4] It is shown loosely knotted in
the front, but is sometimes visible with the ends tucked inside the
cuirass.[5]

In Latin literature, *focale* is a general word for a scarf or wrapping
for the throat.[6] A *focale* was one of the gifts that might be given
for the December festival of [Saturnalia](Saturnalia "wikilink"),
according to [Martial](Martial "wikilink").[7] In one of his
[satires](Satires_(Horace) "wikilink"), [Horace](Horace "wikilink")
lists *focalia* among the "badges of illness" *(insignia morbi)*.[8] In
describing the correct attire for public speaking,
[Quintilian](Quintilian "wikilink") advises against wearing a *focale*,
unless required by poor health.[9]

Although a *sudarium* often is used as a
[handkerchief](handkerchief "wikilink"), it can be worn like the
*focale* as a [neckerchief](neckerchief "wikilink").[10] When
[Suetonius](Suetonius "wikilink") describes the overly casual attire of
[Nero](Nero "wikilink"), the emperor is barefoot, unbelted, and dressed
in [evening wear](formal_wear "wikilink")
*([synthesis](Synthesis_(clothing) "wikilink"))*, with a *sudarium*
around his neck.[11] In late antiquity, *orarium* (Greek
*[orarion](orarion "wikilink")*) might be synonymous with *focale*, as
in the description of military attire in the *[Vision of
Dorotheus](Vision_of_Dorotheus "wikilink")*, and in a
[papyrus](papyri "wikilink") (dated 350–450 AD) listing military
clothes.[12]

The *focale* is sometimes seen as one of the precursors of the
[necktie](necktie "wikilink").[13] [Cesare
Vecellio](Cesare_Vecellio "wikilink") (1530–1606) mentions the *focale*,
calling it a *cravata* ([cravat](cravat "wikilink")), as worn by Roman
soldiers in his book on the history of fashion.[14] It has been compared
to the *[amice](amice "wikilink")* *(amictus)* worn by Roman Catholic
priests, which is depicted from the 6th century onward, as in the
[Ravenna mosaics](Ravenna_mosaics "wikilink").[15]
