A **lappet** is a decorative flap, fold or hanging part of a
[headdress](headdress "wikilink") or garment. Lappets were a feature of
women's headgear until the early twentieth century, and are still a
feature of religious garments. Examples of lappets are to be found on
the [papal tiara](papal_tiara "wikilink") and on the
[nemes](nemes "wikilink") headdress of the kings of [ancient
Egypt](ancient_Egypt "wikilink"). The same term is also used for
similar-looking anatomical features on some animals.

## On episcopal mitres

wearing lappets hanging down on each side of her neck.\]\] The
[mitres](mitre "wikilink") worn by [bishops](bishops "wikilink") and
[abbots](abbots "wikilink") of Western liturgical denominations, such as
the [Roman Catholic Church](Catholic_Church "wikilink") and the [Church
of England](Church_of_England "wikilink"), have lappets attached to
them.

The lappets are probably a vestige of the ancient Greek headband called
a *[mitra](mitra "wikilink")* (μἱτρα), from which the mitre itself
descends. The *mitra* was a band of cloth tied around the head, the ends
of the remaining fabric of which would fall down the back of the neck.

The Latin name for the lappets is *infulae*, which were originally
headbands worn by dignitaries, priests, and others among the ancient
Romans.[1] They were generally white. Mitre lappets are often lined with
red silk.

In the [Armenian Apostolic Church](Armenian_Apostolic_Church "wikilink")
the lappets are not attached directly to the mitre but are attached to
the back of the [cope](cope "wikilink").

## On the papal tiara

![](Heraldic_Imperial_Crown_Gules-Lappets.svg "fig:Heraldic_Imperial_Crown_Gules-Lappets.svg")
of the [Holy Roman Empire](Holy_Roman_Empire "wikilink") with
lappets\]\] Since early [mediæval](mediæval "wikilink") times each papal
tiara has included two lappets. Their origins remain a mystery, though
they are obviously an imitation of the lappets on the bishop's mitre. It
has been speculated that lappets first were added to papal tiaras as a
form of sweatband, with inner cloth being used to prevent popes from
sweating too heavily during papal ceremonial in hot
[Roman](Rome "wikilink") summers.

The two lappets (, literally "tails") at the back of the tiara are first
seen in the pictures and sculpture in the thirteenth century, but were
undoubtedly customary before this. They were black in color, as is
evident both from the monumental remains and from the inventories, and
this color was retained even into the fifteenth century.

Papal lappets on tiaras came to be highly decorated, with intricate
stitching in gold thread. Often a pope who either commissioned a tiara,
received it as a gift, or who had it remodelled for their usage, had
their [coat of arms](coat_of_arms "wikilink") stitched on to the
lappets. Many later papal lappets were made of
[embroidered](embroidered "wikilink") silk and used
[lace](lace "wikilink").

The last tiara to be used for a coronation, created for [Pope Paul
VI](Pope_Paul_VI "wikilink") in 1963, also contained lappets.

## On animals

The word is also sometimes used to refer to
[wattles](Wattle_(anatomy) "wikilink"), flap-like structures that occur
on the faces of some animals. For instance, the [lappet-faced
vulture](lappet-faced_vulture "wikilink") has lappets of bare flesh on
the sides of its head.

[1] Latin *[infula](:wikt:infula "wikilink")* means "a band, bandage",
cognate with Sanskrit *bhāla* "brow" and Greek φάλος, φάλαρα, a Homeric
term for a part of the helmet. It came to refer to the white and red
fillet or band of woollen stuff worn upon the forehead by priests as a
sign of religious consecration.
