The **red scarf** is a [neckerchief](neckerchief "wikilink") worn by
[Young Pioneers](Young_Pioneer "wikilink") of several countries during
the socialist (“communist”) era. In the Soviet Union it was known as
*pionerskiy galstuk* (пионерский галстук, i. e. pioneer’s neckerchief),
in Vietnam as *khăn quàng đỏ* (red scarf), in China as *hong lingjin*
(紅領巾, red scarf), in Cuba as *pañoleta roja* (red scarf), and in
Hungary as *úttörőnyakkendő* (pioneer’s neckerchief). Blue scarves were
also used by youngsters before coming of age to wear the red one, and
are still seen in some countries.

It remains in use by the [Young Pioneers](Young_Pioneer "wikilink") of
[China](China "wikilink"), [Vietnam](Vietnam "wikilink"), [North
Korea](North_Korea "wikilink"), [Laos](Laos "wikilink") and
[Cuba](Cuba "wikilink"), and — unofficially, on occasions — in many
other countries, such as [Russia](Russia "wikilink"),
[Venezuela](Venezuela "wikilink"), [Zimbabwe](Zimbabwe "wikilink"),
[Belarus](Belarus "wikilink"), [Ukraine](Ukraine "wikilink"),
[Finland](Finland "wikilink") etc. In China, the scarf is emblematic of
blood of revolutionary martyrs, as recalled in [Red Scarf
Park](Red_Scarf_Park "wikilink") and the title of [Red Scarf
Girl](Red_Scarf_Girl "wikilink") by [Ji-li
Jiang](Ji-li_Jiang "wikilink") about her experiences during the
[Cultural Revolution](Cultural_Revolution "wikilink"). In Cuba, the
scarf is worn by schoolchildren from first to sixth grade.[1]
