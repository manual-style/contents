![](Kazuivel_II.jpg "fig:Kazuivel_II.jpg"), worn over an
[alb](alb "wikilink")\]\] The **stole** is a
[liturgical](liturgy "wikilink") [vestment](vestment "wikilink") of
various [Christian](Christianity "wikilink")
[denominations](religious_denomination "wikilink"). It consists of a
band of colored cloth, formerly usually of [silk](silk "wikilink"),
about seven and a half to nine feet long and three to four inches wide,
whose ends may be straight or may broaden out. The center of the stole
is worn around the back of the neck and the two ends hang down parallel
to each other in front, either attached to each other or hanging loose.
The stole is almost always decorated in some way, usually with a cross
or some other significant religious design. It is often decorated with
contrasting galloons (ornamental [trim](trim_(sewing) "wikilink")) and
[fringe](Christianity_and_fringed_garments "wikilink") is usually
applied to the ends of the stole following . A piece of white linen or
lace may be stitched onto the back of the collar as a sweat guard, which
can be replaced more cheaply than the stole itself.

## Etymology and history

![](Extreme_Unction_Rogier_Van_der_Weyden.jpg "fig:Extreme_Unction_Rogier_Van_der_Weyden.jpg")
while wearing a narrow, gold stole (Detail of [Rogier van der
Weyden](Rogier_van_der_Weyden "wikilink")'s *[The Seven
Sacraments](Seven_Sacraments_Altarpiece "wikilink")*, 1445)\]\]

The word *stole* derives via the [Latin](Latin_language "wikilink")
*stola*, from the [Greek](Greek_language "wikilink") στολή (*stolē*),
"garment", originally "array" or "equipment".

The stole was originally a kind of shawl that covered the shoulders and
fell down in front of the body; on women they were often very large.
After being adopted by the Church of Rome around the seventh century
(the stole having also been adopted in other locales prior to this), the
stole gradually became narrower and started to feature more ornate
designs, developing into a mark of dignity. Nowadays, the stole is
usually wider and can be made from a wide variety of material.

There are many theories as to the "ancestry" of the stole. Some say it
came from the [tallit](tallit "wikilink") (Jewish prayer mantle),
because it is very similar to the present usage (as in the minister puts
it on when he or she leads in prayer) but this theory is no longer
regarded much today. More popular is the theory that the stole
originated from a kind of liturgical napkin called an
*[orarium](orarium "wikilink")* (cf. [orarion](orarion "wikilink")) very
similar to the [sudarium](sudarium "wikilink"). In fact, in many places
the stole is called the orarium. Therefore, it is linked to the napkin
used by [Christ](Jesus_of_Nazareth "wikilink") in washing the feet of
his disciples, and is a fitting symbol of the yoke of Christ, the yoke
of service.

The most likely origin for the stole, however, is to be connected with
the scarf of office among Imperial officials in the [Roman
Empire](Roman_Empire "wikilink"). As members of the clergy became
members of the Roman administration (see [Constantine I and
Christianity](Constantine_I_and_Christianity "wikilink")) they were
granted certain honors, one specifically being a designator of rank
within the imperial (and ecclesiastical) hierarchy. The various
configurations of the stole (including the [pallium](pallium "wikilink")
or the [omophorion](omophorion "wikilink")) grew out of this usage. The
original intent, then was to designate a person as belonging to a
particular organization and to denote their rank within their group, a
function which the stole continues to perform today. Thus, unlike other
liturgical garments which were originally worn by every cleric or
layman, the stole was a garment which was specifically restricted to
particular classes of people based on occupation.

Stoles were already used in pre-Roman Italic religion. In the
[Umbrian](Umbrian "wikilink") [Iguvine
Tablets](Iguvine_Tablets "wikilink"), a stole was used by an officiating
priest during offering rituals.[1][2] It was worn on the shoulder during
a sacrifice, and then placed on an offering cake:

*While you are slaying it, wear a stole on your right shoulder. When you
have slain it, place (the stole) upon the mefa cake. While you are
presenting it, wear the stole on your right shoulder. Present
grain-offerings and sacrifice with mead.* (ibid, pg. 164)

## Symbolism and color

![](Stolecolours.jpg "fig:Stolecolours.jpg").\]\]

Together with the [cincture](cincture "wikilink") and the now mostly
defunct [maniple](maniple_(vestment) "wikilink"), the stole symbolizes
the bonds and fetters with which [Jesus](Jesus "wikilink") was bound
during his [Passion](Passion_(Christianity) "wikilink");[3] it is
usually ornamented with a cross. Another version is that the stole
denotes [the duty to spread the Word of
God](Great_Commission "wikilink").

A stole will generally be the [liturgical
color](liturgical_color "wikilink") assigned by the church for the
liturgical season or for the particular service.

## Use

### Western Christianity

![](BentoXVI-30-10052007.jpg "fig:BentoXVI-30-10052007.jpg") wearing an
embroidered papal stole.\]\]

#### Roman Catholic

In the [Latin Catholic tradition](Roman_Catholic_Church "wikilink") the
stole is the vestment that marks recipients of [Holy
Orders](Holy_Orders "wikilink"). It is conferred at the
[ordination](ordination "wikilink") of a [deacon](deacon "wikilink"), by
which one becomes a member of the clergy after the suppression of the
tonsure and [minor orders](minor_orders "wikilink") after the [Second
Vatican Council](Second_Vatican_Council "wikilink").

A [bishop](bishop "wikilink") or other [priest](priest "wikilink") wears
the stole around his neck with the ends hanging down in front, while the
[deacon](deacon "wikilink") places it over his left shoulder and ties it
cross-wise at his right side, similar to a sash.

Before the reform of the liturgy after the Second Vatican Council,
priests who were not bishops were required to cross the stole over the
breast (as pictured below), but only at
[Mass](Mass_(liturgy) "wikilink") or at other functions at which a
[chasuble](chasuble "wikilink") or [cope](cope "wikilink") was worn. It
is now often worn hanging straight down without being crossed across the
breast. The General Instruction of the Roman Missal, which is the
liturgical law for the Roman Catholic Church concerning the Mass, no
longer makes explicit that a Priest must cross his stole. It states,
"the stole is worn by the Priest around his neck and hanging down in
front of his chest..." (GIRM §340). Unless there is a law promulgated by
a particular diocese or other ordinary, it is left to the priest to
interpret what this means. On solemn occasions, the
[Pope](Pope "wikilink") wears, as part of his [choir
dress](choir_dress "wikilink"), a special stole of state highly
decorated and bearing his personal [coat of
arms](coat_of_arms "wikilink").

For the celebration of the Mass, the principal celebrant as well as
concelebrants wear the stole over the [alb](alb "wikilink") but under
the chasuble. Likewise, the deacon wears the stole over the alb but
under the dalmatic. The stole is also worn over the
[surplice](surplice "wikilink") or alb for the distribution and
reception of Holy Communion.

The priest or deacon who presides in paraliturgical celebrations, such
as the Stations of the Cross, usually wears the stole over the surplice
(or alb), and always under the cope.

#### Anglican

![](Anglican_priest_vested_in_an_alb,_cincture_and_purple_stole.jpg "fig:Anglican_priest_vested_in_an_alb,_cincture_and_purple_stole.jpg").\]\]
![](Stoledeacon.jpg "fig:Stoledeacon.jpg").\]\] During the [English
Reformation](English_Reformation "wikilink"), the stole, along with all
other sacramental vestments were removed from the Church of England. The
[Oxford Movement](Oxford_Movement "wikilink") began an interest in
pre-Reformation worship, and eventually the stole (along with other
vestments) were revived among
[Anglo-Catholic](Anglo-Catholic "wikilink") clergy. Though today, it is
not uncommon for a [Low Church](Low_Church "wikilink") priest to wear a
stole with choir dress, stricter ones may still object to its use, and
wear the [tippet](tippet "wikilink") instead. This re-introduction of
the stole continued to cause concern even in the 20th century. During
the 1950s, the Bishop of London, [William
Wand](William_Wand "wikilink"), and the Bishop of Oxford, [Kenneth
Kirk](Kenneth_Kirk "wikilink") refused to ordain any candidate to the
priesthood who would not wear a stole. Many candidates objected to
wearing it because of their theological and traditional allegiances.
Finally, [Geoffrey Fisher](Geoffrey_Fisher "wikilink"), Archbishop of
Canterbury, had to resolve the matter, and instructed that all bishops
must not refuse ordination simply because the candidate was unwilling to
wear the stole. Today, there is less controversy. When a stole is used
in a deacon's ordination, it may be conferred on him or her and worn
over the shoulder. At ordination to the
[priesthood](priesthood "wikilink"), the newly ordained priest then
wears the stole around his or her neck, hanging down in front, either
straight down or crossed across the front of the body and secured with
the [cincture](cincture "wikilink").

#### Protestant

In [Protestant](Protestant "wikilink") churches, the stole is most often
seen as the symbol of ordination and the office of the ministry of
[Word](Good_news_(Christianity) "wikilink") and
[Sacrament](Sacrament "wikilink"). Stoles are often given by the
congregation (sometimes hand-made or decorated) as a love gift at
ordination or at other life milestones. Generally, Protestant clergy
wear the stole in the same manner as Catholic priests—around the back of
the neck with the ends hanging down the front (though not crossed).
Stoles are commonly worn by ordained ministers in
[Lutheran](Lutheran "wikilink") (see below),
[Methodist](Methodist "wikilink") (see below),
[Presbyterian](Presbyterian "wikilink"), [United Church of
Christ](United_Church_of_Christ "wikilink"), [Christian Church
(Disciples of
Christ)](Christian_Church_(Disciples_of_Christ) "wikilink"), and other
denominations. The clergy of some other Protestant denominations will
wear stoles, though normally those in the less liturgical churches will
wear either a [pulpit robe](pulpit_robe "wikilink") (with a [preaching
scarf](preaching_scarf "wikilink")) or simply a
[suit](Suit_(clothing) "wikilink") during [church
services](church_service "wikilink").

##### Lutheran

In the [Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America](Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_America "wikilink") (ELCA), the
[Lutheran Church–Missouri
Synod](Lutheran_Church–Missouri_Synod "wikilink") (LCMS), and the
[Independent Evangelical-Lutheran
Church](Independent_Evangelical-Lutheran_Church "wikilink")
([Germany](Germany "wikilink")), only [pastors](pastor "wikilink") wear
the stole, as there is only the one order of ordination, that of pastor,
in these Lutheran traditions. (The office of bishop for [Episcopal
polity](Episcopal_polity "wikilink") and president for [Congregational
Polity](Congregationalist_polity "wikilink") is not a separate order of
ordination.) Diaconal ministers, the ELCA's equivalent to the deacon,
generally do not wear the stole, but sometimes will wear the traditional
deacon's stole while performing liturgical functions traditional to the
diaconal order. However, in certain Lutheran Churches where people are
ordained to the diaconal ministry, such as in the [Evangelical Lutheran
Church of Finland](Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_of_Finland "wikilink"),
wearing a deacon's stole when assisting in a liturgy is an official
rule. The Evangelical-Lutheran [Church of
Sweden](Church_of_Sweden "wikilink") clergy follow the use described for
Anglican deacons and priests in this article, except the practice of
wearing the stole hanging straight down is reserved for bishops (priests
wear it crossed over the chest except over a surplice, when no cincture
is worn).

##### Methodist

In the [United Methodist Church](United_Methodist_Church "wikilink"),
ordained [deacons](deacon "wikilink") wear a stole around the shoulder
as in the Anglican and Roman traditions. An ordained
[elder](Elder_(Methodism) "wikilink") wears the stole in the same
fashion as an Anglican or Roman Catholic priest, with the role of elder
being the Methodist equivalent, among other Protestant denominations, to
that office. The English word "priest" is in fact derived from the Greek
word *presbyter*, which means "elder".

### Eastern Christianity

![](Epitrachelion.jpg "fig:Epitrachelion.jpg")\]\]
![](Orthodox_Deacon.jpg "fig:Orthodox_Deacon.jpg")\]\]

#### Byzantine practice

In The Byzantine Rite practice of the [Eastern
Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "wikilink") and [Greek
Catholic](Greek_Catholic "wikilink") churches, the stole worn by a
deacon is called an [orarion](orarion "wikilink"), while that worn by a
priest or bishop is called an [epitrachelion](epitrachelion "wikilink")
(a bishop additionally wears an [omophorion](omophorion "wikilink")),
all similar in meaning and use to the Western stole. In Greek Orthodox
practice, the deacon wears a double orarion, meaning it comes over the
left arm and under the right. Minor clerics (and in Greek and
[Melkite](Melkite "wikilink") traditions the [altar
servers](altar_server "wikilink") as well) wear an orarion wrapped
around their waist, crossed in back, and then either crossed again in
front and tucked under the belted section or not crossed and tucked in
(see explanation of subdeacon below).

The [priest](priest "wikilink")'s epitrachelion consists of a long strip
of cloth, hung around the neck with the two strips fastened together in
front, either by buttons or by stitching. The epitrachelion comes down
in front almost to the hem of his robes, and is symbolic of the priest's
"anointing" ([Septuagint](Septuagint "wikilink"): Psalm 132:2;
[KJV](KJV "wikilink"): [Psalm 133](Psalm_133 "wikilink"):2).
Traditionally—though not necessarily—the epitrachelion will have seven
crosses on it: six in the front (three on each side) and one on the back
of the collar. The priest traditionally blesses the cross on the collar
and kisses it before he puts it on, and kisses it again when he takes it
off. When he is vesting for the [Divine
Liturgy](Divine_Liturgy "wikilink"), he says the following prayer before
putting on the epitrachelion:

> *Blessed is God, Who poureth out His grace upon His priests, like the
> oil of [myrrh](myrrh "wikilink") upon the head, which runneth down
> upon the beard, upon the beard of [Aaron](Aaron "wikilink"): which
> runneth down to the fringe of his raiment.* (Cf. Psalm 132:2,
> [LXX](Septuagint "wikilink"))

In the [Russian Orthodox](Russian_Orthodox "wikilink") tradition, the
priest may say a special blessing and sprinkle the epitrachelion with
[holy water](holy_water "wikilink") before it is worn for the first
time. A priest is not permitted to celebrate even the simplest service,
even the [Daily Office](Daily_Office "wikilink"), unless he is wearing
the epitrachelion (and in some traditions the
[epimanikia](epimanikia "wikilink"), or "cuffs", as well). When a member
of the faithful goes to [Confession](Confession_(religion) "wikilink"),
the priest places the edge of his epitrachelion over the head of the
penitent as he confesses his sins. After the
[absolution](absolution "wikilink"), the penitent will often kiss the
priest's hand and then one of the crosses on the edge of the
epitrachelion. At an Orthodox wedding, the priest will have the bridal
couple hold the edge of his epitrachelion as he leads them in a
procession three times around the [Gospel Book](Gospel_Book "wikilink"),
symbolizing the [pilgrimage](pilgrimage "wikilink") of life.

The [protodeacon](protodeacon "wikilink") or
[archdeacon](archdeacon "wikilink") wears the orarion "doubled", i.e.,
over the left shoulder, under the right arm, and passing again over the
left shoulder. The two ends hang down, one in the front and one in the
back, coming down almost to the hem of his
[sticharion](sticharion "wikilink") (dalmatic).

A [deacon](deacon "wikilink") wears an orarion which simply passes over
the left shoulder, the two ends of which hang straight down, one in the
front and one in the back, coming down almost to the hem of his
sticharion. This is only common in the most traditional Orthodox
churches. In many Eastern traditions, the stole is always worn "doubled"
unless the deacon in question is wearing only his
[exorasson](exorasson "wikilink") (outer cassock) and then it is
essentially folded and worn over the left shoulder.

The [subdeacon](subdeacon "wikilink") wears his orarion over both
shoulders, crossed in the back and the front. Those acting as subdeacons
(i.e., vested and serving as subdeacons but without having been
ordained) wear their orarion crossed only in the back, to show that they
do not bear [holy orders](holy_orders "wikilink").

#### Oriental Orthodox

![](Al_Quds_Patriarch.jpg "fig:Al_Quds_Patriarch.jpg"). The wide
oriental stole is clearly visible on the
[Patriarch](List_of_Armenian_Patriarchs_of_Jerusalem "wikilink")
(center, with [crozier](crozier "wikilink") and
[pallium](pallium "wikilink")).\]\]

In the [Oriental Orthodox
Churches](Oriental_Orthodox_Churches "wikilink"), the priestly stole is
very similar to the epitrachelion described above; however, instead of a
long narrow strip of fabric that is wrapped around the neck and fastened
together, it is often cut out of a single broad piece of cloth that has
a hole cut in it for the head to pass through. Sometimes, depending upon
the liturgical Rite, it also extends farther down the back.

### British Monarch

The [British](United_Kingdom "wikilink")
[Monarch](Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"), although not in
[Holy Orders](Holy_Orders "wikilink"), is
[anointed](Anointing "wikilink") with the oil of
[Chrism](Chrism "wikilink") and invested with a stole during the
[Coronation rite](Coronation_of_the_British_Monarch "wikilink"). This
stole, made of gold silk, is officially named the *Stole Royal* or
*Armilla*, and is one of several coronation robes kept overnight in the
[Jerusalem Chamber](Jerusalem_Chamber "wikilink") of [Westminster
Abbey](Westminster_Abbey "wikilink") before the day of the
coronation.[4] The Coronation (which is always in the context of a
[Eucharist](Eucharist "wikilink")) is an official liturgy of the [Church
of England](Church_of_England "wikilink"); the [Archbishop of
Canterbury](Archbishop_of_Canterbury "wikilink") has responsibility for
the ceremony and is almost always its presider.

### Mandaean

A stole is used in the [Mandaean](Mandaean "wikilink") religion by the
priests during rituals.[5]

### Unitarian Universalist

A stole/scarf/tippet is worn in the [Unitarian
Universalist](Unitarian_Universalist "wikilink") religion by some
ministers during weekly services. The garment is a symbol of ministry.
UU stoles often are adorned with the Unitarian Universalist chalice and
come in a wide range of colors.
