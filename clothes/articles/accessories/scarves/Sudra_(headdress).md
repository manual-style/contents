![](YemeniJew.jpg "fig:YemeniJew.jpg") wearing a *sudra*\]\] **Sudra**
([Hebrew](Hebrew "wikilink") and [Aramaic](Aramaic "wikilink"): ) is a
traditional ancient [Jewish](Jewish "wikilink")
[headdress](headdress "wikilink"), or what is also called a *habit*.

## Etymology

The name *sudra* is [Aramaic](Aramaic "wikilink") and derived from the
[Latin](Latin "wikilink") word , which means 'cloth' or
'handkerchief'.[1]

## History

The sudra is believed to be thousands of years old and referred to in
the Bible. [Ancient Hebrews](Israelites "wikilink") wore a headgear that
was similar to either a [keffiyeh](keffiyeh "wikilink"),
[turban](turban "wikilink") or a [stocking
cap](stocking_cap "wikilink"). There are many ways of tying the fabric
to make these different designs.[2] The sudra has been mentioned
directly and indirectly in ancient Jewish religious texts, including the
[Babylonian Talmud](Babylonian_Talmud "wikilink"). Various
[targums](targum "wikilink") or translators have interpreted different
words in the [Book of Ruth](Book_of_Ruth "wikilink"), such as ( ) to be
'the keffiyeh of the Jews'. In Jewish tradition, the sudra was a twisted
scarf worn around the neck[3] There is also evidence of Jews wearing the
sudra on their heads like a keffiyeh or turban in [Tractate
Berakhot](Berakhot_(tractate) "wikilink") in the Babylonian Talmud.[4]

### Decline

There are numerous reasons why sudras have fallen out of favour with
modern Jews. According to Benny Katz of the [Zionist Freedom
Alliance](Zionist_Freedom_Alliance "wikilink") (ZFA):

> In ancient times, it was common for Jews to wear *keffiyot*, but the
> conquest of the region by Islamic tribes brought with it a series of
> laws that gave non-Muslims an inferior position in society. Synagogues
> could not be built higher than mosques and Jews could not ride atop
> animals for fear that they would appear higher than Muslims. As the
> *keffiyeh* came to be seen as the crown of the Arabs and its wearer
> was attributed an honorable status, non-Muslims were forbidden from
> wearing such garments.[5]
