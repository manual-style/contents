![](Tichel_headcovering.jpg "fig:Tichel_headcovering.jpg") **Tichel**
([Yiddish](Yiddish "wikilink") טיכל *tikhl*), also called a *mitpachat*
([Hebrew](Hebrew_language "wikilink") מִטפַּחַת *miṭpaḥat*), is the
[Yiddish](Yiddish "wikilink") word for the
[headscarf](headscarf "wikilink") worn by many married [Orthodox
Jewish](Orthodox_Judaism "wikilink") women in compliance with the code
of modesty known as *[tzniut](tzniut "wikilink")*, which requires
married women to cover their hair.[1] Tichels can range from a simple
plain color cotton kerchief tied in the back to elaborate head coverings
using multiple fabrics and tying techniques.

## Etymology

The Yiddish word *tichel* is the [diminutive](diminutive "wikilink") of
*tuch* ("cloth"). Compare German *Tuch* ("cloth"), and the corresponding
[Bavarian](Bavarian_language "wikilink") diminutive *Tiachal, Tücherl*
("small piece of cloth").

## Background

After the wedding ceremony, Orthodox Jews believe that a woman should
only show her hair to her husband.[2] According to the
[Mishnah](Mishnah "wikilink") in [Ketuboth](Ketuboth "wikilink") (7:6),
hair covering is not an obligation of biblical origin. It discusses
behaviors that are grounds for divorce such as, "appearing in public
with loose hair, weaving in the marketplace, and talking to any man" and
calls these violations of *Dat Yehudit*, which means Jewish rule, as
opposed to *Dat Moshe*, Mosaic rule. However, the
[Talmud](Talmud "wikilink") on this Mishna explains that if the hair is
completely uncovered in public, this would indeed be a violation of "Dat
Moshe", and the Mishna is referring to one who cover her hair with a
netlike covering where hair is visible through the holes, as in this
case the Biblical requirement is met, but not the "Dat Yehudit".[3].
This categorization suggests that hair covering is not an absolute
obligation originating from Moses at Sinai, but rather is a standard of
modesty that was defined by the Jewish community. In
[Berakhot](Berakhot_(Talmud) "wikilink") 24a), the rabbis define hair as
sexually erotic (*ervah*), and prohibit men from praying in sight of a
woman's hair. The rabbis base this estimation on a biblical verse: "Your
hair is like a flock of goats" (Song of Songs 4:1), suggesting that this
praise reflects the sensual nature of hair.
