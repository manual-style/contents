A **clip-on tie** is a [bow tie](/bow_tie "wikilink") or
[necktie](/necktie "wikilink") which is permanently tied, and worn by
attaching it to the front of the shirt collar by a clip. Alternately,
especially in the case of bow ties, the tie may have a band around the
neck fastened with a hook and eye.

## Reasons for use

The following are some reasons that this style of tie may be used:

-   Tightly tied standard neckties may be a source of irritation and
    discomfort.
-   Some people, particularly children, do not know how to tie a
    standard necktie, or do not feel comfortable tying one.
-   Some persons with disabilities may be physically incapable of tying
    a tie, or only capable of it with extreme difficulty.
-   [Police officers](/Police_officer "wikilink") and [security
    guards](/security_guard "wikilink") often wear clip-ons as a
    precaution against being strangled by a pulled necktie. (With
    [uniform](/Uniform#Police "wikilink"), a [tie
    clip](/tie_clip "wikilink") may be used to keep the tie from
    "flying" in the wind.)
-   Some schools require clip-on ties as part of their uniform instead
    of regular ties as this keeps students from loosening them in hot
    weather.
-   A clip-on tie can be put on more quickly than a conventional
    necktie.
-   A clip-on tie is used as a safety precaution in a manufacturing
    setting to avoid neck injury due to machine entanglement.
