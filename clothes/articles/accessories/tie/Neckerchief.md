[alt=\|thumb\|309x309px\|A Scouting neckerchief and
woggle](/File:Scout_pañuelo02.png "wikilink") A **neckerchief** (from
*neck* (n.) + *[kerchief](/kerchief "wikilink")*[1]), sometimes called a
**necker**, **kerchief** or **scarf**, is a type of
[neckwear](/neckwear "wikilink") associated with those working or living
outdoors, including farm labourers, [cowboys](/cowboy "wikilink") and
[sailors](/sailor "wikilink"). It is most commonly still seen today in
the [Scouts](/Scouts "wikilink"), Girl Guides and other similar youth
movements. A neckerchief consists of a triangular piece of cloth or a
rectangular piece folded into a triangle. The long edge is rolled
towards the point, leaving a portion unrolled. The neckerchief is then
fastened around the neck with the ends either tied or clasped with a
slide or [woggle](/woggle "wikilink").

## Wearing

Neckerchiefs worn by sailors are shaped like a square, and are folded in
half diagonally before rolling, with rolling occurring from the tip of
the resulting triangle to its hypotenuse. Either neckerchief is then
placed on the wearer's back, under or over the
[shirt](/shirt "wikilink") [collar](/collar_(clothing) "wikilink") with
the ends at the front of the wearer. The rolled ends then pass around
the neck until they meet in front of it, where they are secured
together, either with a [knot](/knot "wikilink"), such as a [reef
knot](/reef_knot "wikilink") or a [slip knot](/slip_knot "wikilink"), or
with a [rubber band](/rubber_band "wikilink") or other fastener (called
a *[woggle](/woggle "wikilink")* or *neckerchief slide*) and allowed to
hang. A slip knot (vs. a simple reef or square knot) will give way if
the neckerchief gets caught and is thus less likely to choke the wearer.

Sailors in the [United States Navy](/United_States_Navy "wikilink") have
worn a rolled black neckerchief since the [American Civil
War](/American_Civil_War "wikilink").[2] It is currently part of the
men's service dress uniform for junior enlisted sailors as well as the
women's summer dress uniform.[3]

## Scouting

The [Scouting](/Scouting "wikilink") movement makes the neckerchief part
of its uniform. A generally ceremonial item, the neckerchief is taught
to be a practical [wilderness](/wilderness "wikilink") item in the
Scouting tradition. The neckerchief, unrolled, is designed to be the
perfect size for use as a triangular [bandage](/bandage "wikilink") for
[first aid](/first_aid "wikilink").

The origin of the Scouting neckerchief seems to be in [Robert
Baden-Powell](/Robert_Baden-Powell "wikilink")'s participation in the
[Second Matabele War](/Second_Matabele_War "wikilink") in 1896; where he
worked with [Frederick Russell
Burnham](/Frederick_Russell_Burnham "wikilink"), an American-born
[scout](/Cavalry_Scout "wikilink") employed by the [British
Army](/British_Army "wikilink"). Baden-Powell copied Burnham's practical
style of dress, including *"a grey-coloured handkerchief, loosely tied
around the neck to prevent sunburn"*.[4] When Baden-Powell launched the
[Scout Movement](/Scout_Movement "wikilink") with the book *[Scouting
for Boys](/Scouting_for_Boys "wikilink")* in 1908, he prescribed a
neckerchief or scarf as part of the Scout uniform, which he stated was
*"very like the uniform worn by my men when I commanded the [South
African Constabulary](/South_African_Constabulary "wikilink")"*. He
continued; *"Every Troop has its own scarf colour, since the honour of
your Troop is bound up in the scarf, you must be very careful to keep it
tidy and clean."*[5] Initially, Scout neckerchiefs were tied with a
variety of knots, but the use of a "woggle" or slide, originated in the
United States in the early 1920s and quickly spread around the Scouting
world.[6]

Each Scout group would have a neckerchief of different design and
colours. In most countries each Scout Troop uses its own colour
neckerchief. The colours are usually the "Troop Colours" which may have
a particular historical significance to the troop or to the local
community.

At Scouting camps and jamborees these neckerchiefs represent units,
subcamps or the camp as a whole. Fun scarves are also used as
memorabilia at Scout events and country scarves are often traded at
international gatherings

In [Canada](/Canada "wikilink"), while most groups use colour
neckerchiefs, there is also an optional alternate universal pattern
tartan neckerchief: white plaid on red for Scouts, gold plaid on dark
green for Cubs. Alternating thick and thin lines of the plaid spell out
"CANADA" in Morse code.

In [Australia](/Australia "wikilink"), Queensland uses a single maroon
necker for the whole state, while the other states allow groups,
Venturer Units and Rover Crews to choose their own necker. Region and
Branch Teams also have their own neckers.

In [Hungary](/Hungary "wikilink"), as well as the Hungarian diaspora
communities in countries such as the US, the necktie color is national
rather than distinctive for each troop, being light blue for ages 10 and
younger and grass green for ages 11 and up.

In other countries individual patrols are identifiable by their
neckerchiefs and so troops may have many different neckerchiefs all at
once. In both of these cases the neckerchief and its colours are an
issue of identity, and become emblematic of a troop or a
[patrol](/patrol "wikilink").

Neckerchiefs can also have important ceremonial functions in Scouting,
for example, the [1st Gilwell Scout
Group](/Wood_Badge#1st_Gilwell_Scout_Group_neckerchief "wikilink")
present a special neckerchief on completion of the [Wood
Badge](/Wood_Badge "wikilink").

## Political youth movements

In [Nazi Germany](/Nazi_Germany "wikilink"), the [Hitler
Jugend](/Hitler_Jugend "wikilink"), [Deutsches
Jungvolk](/Deutsches_Jungvolk "wikilink") and [Bund Deutscher
Mädel](/League_of_German_Girls "wikilink") all wore a black neckerchief
as part of their uniform, usually folded under the shirt collar.[7] It
has been suggested that it was copied from Scouting,[8] which was banned
in Germany in 1935.

In many [Communist states](/Communist_state "wikilink"), members of the
[Pioneer movement](/Pioneer_movement "wikilink") wore a red neckerchief
which was sometimes worn without the rest of the uniform.[9] This
continues at present in [China](/China "wikilink") and
[Vietnam](/Vietnam "wikilink").[10]
