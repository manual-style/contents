[thumb\|right\|491x491px\|A selection of tie clips, mostly from the
early to mid 20th century](/Image:Tie_clips_wiki.jpg "wikilink") A **tie
clip** (also **tie slide**, **tie bar**, or **tie clasp**)[1] is a
clothing [accessory](/fashion_accessory "wikilink") that is used to clip
a [tie](/necktie "wikilink") to the underlying
[shirt](/shirt "wikilink") front, preventing it from swinging and
ensuring that the tie hangs straight, resulting in a neat, uniform
appearance.

Tie clips are commonly made of metal and often have decorative patterns
or embellishments. Some clips have a small badge indicating membership
to a club or some other affiliation, or some other commemorative token,
in a similar manner to the way in which ties themselves may be used as
signs of membership. The use of tie clips gained prominence during the
1920s, during which period the use of straight ties made of delicate
materials such as silk became more fashionable, and they largely came to
replace the more traditional [tie pin](/tie_pin "wikilink").[2]

In the United States, a tie clip is one of the few items of jewelry
allowed to be worn by servicemen and women.[3]
