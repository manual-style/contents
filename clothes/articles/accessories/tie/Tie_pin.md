A **tie pin** (or **tiepin**, also known as a **stick
pin**/**stickpin**) is a [neckwear](/necktie "wikilink")-controlling
device, originally worn by wealthy English
[gentlemen](/gentlemen "wikilink") to secure the folds of their
[cravats](/cravat "wikilink"). They were first popularized at the
beginning of the 19th century. Cravats were made of
[silk](/silk "wikilink"), [satin](/satin "wikilink"),
[lace](/lace "wikilink") and lightly starched
[cambric](/cambric "wikilink"), [lawn](/lawn_cloth "wikilink") and
[muslin](/muslin "wikilink"), and stickpins were necessary accoutrements
to keep these expensive fabrics in place and safe. Stickpins commonly
used [pearls](/pearl "wikilink") and other precious
[gemstones](/gemstone "wikilink") set in gold or other precious metals
and were designed specifically for their owners.

By the 1860s, the English [upper middle
classes](/upper_middle_class "wikilink") embraced wearing cravats with a
consequently lower quality of materials and designs used in both the
neckwear and in the stickpins used to keep it in place. By the 1870s,
Americans had embraced stickpins and designs were mass-produced which
included animal heads, horse shoes, knife and fork motifs, crossed
pipes, wishbones, bugs, flowers, shields and a host of other figural
motifs. By the 1890s, stickpins had crossed gender lines as women began
wearing them with sporting outfits worn for bicycling, boating,
horseback riding, tennis and golf. The [Ascot](/Ascot_tie "wikilink"),
Four in Hand, Sailor scarf, cravat bow tie and wrapped scarf all became
popular for both men and women, and all could be set off with an
ornamental stickpin. Between 1894 and 1930 many patents were issued
covering such issues as prong setting, ornament attachment, stickpin
blanks, safety clutches, guards and decorations. One patent was for a
brooch which could convert the center medallion to a stickpin. Another
concealed a small lead pencil point attached to the shaft of the pin.
Still another included a small water reservoir behind the ornamental
head of the stick pin in which a flower blossom could be placed. Patent
1,301,568 dated April 22, 1919 was for a luminous stickpin with a star
motif disk-like head which held a small drop of radioactive material.[1]

Gold or silver style [safety pins](/safety_pin "wikilink") were commonly
used as tie and collar pins from the beginning of the 20th century. Such
a safety pin was used to fasten the tie to the shirt and was an integral
part of a man's clothing or school uniform, being especially useful on
formal occasions or in windy weather. It could now be possibly making a
comeback in 2013 as recently illustrated in the fashion section of a
British newspaper. Alternative ways to control unruly ties are
available, although an ordinary safety pin inserted through from behind
the shirt can invisibly secure the tie without damaging its surface.

During the 1920s the use of straight ties made of delicate materials
such as silk became more fashionable and the use of [tie
clips](/tie_clip "wikilink") gained prominence, replacing the more
traditional tie pin.
