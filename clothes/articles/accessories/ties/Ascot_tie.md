in a pleated Ascot tie c. 1880\]\] An **ascot tie**, or **ascot** or
**hanker-tie**, is a neckband with wide pointed wings, traditionally
made of pale [grey](grey "wikilink") patterned [silk](silk "wikilink").
This wide [tie](Necktie "wikilink") is usually patterned, folded over,
and fastened with a [tie pin](tie_pin "wikilink") or [tie
clip](tie_clip "wikilink"). It is usually reserved for [formal
wear](formal_wear "wikilink") with [morning
dress](morning_dress "wikilink") for daytime
[weddings](wedding "wikilink") and worn with a cutaway [morning
coat](morning_coat "wikilink") and striped grey [formal
trousers](formal_trousers "wikilink"). This type of dress
[cravat](cravat "wikilink") is made of a thicker, woven type of silk
similar to a modern tie and is traditionally either grey or black.

The ascot is descended from the earlier type of cravat widespread in the
early 19th century, most notably during the age of [Beau
Brummell](Beau_Brummell "wikilink"), made of heavily starched linen and
elaborately tied around the neck. Later in the 1880s, amongst the
upper-middle-class in [Europe](Europe "wikilink") men began to wear a
more loosely tied version for formal daytime events with daytime full
dress in [frock coats](frock_coat "wikilink") or with [morning
coats](morning_coat "wikilink"). It remains a feature of [morning
dress](morning_dress "wikilink") for weddings today. The [Royal
Ascot](Royal_Ascot "wikilink") race meeting at the [Ascot
Racecourse](Ascot_Racecourse "wikilink") gave the ascot its name,
although such dress cravats were no longer worn with [morning
dress](morning_dress "wikilink") at the [Royal
Ascot](Royal_Ascot "wikilink") races by the [Edwardian
era](Edwardian_era "wikilink"). The ascot was still commonly worn for
business with [morning dress](morning_dress "wikilink") in the late 19th
and very early 20th centuries.

In [British English](British_English "wikilink"), the casual form is
called a **cravat**, or sometimes as a **day cravat** to distinguish it
from the highly formal dress cravat. It is made from a thinner woven
silk that is more comfortable when worn against the skin, often with
ornate and colourful printed patterns.

## Military use

Students at the [United States Army Officer Candidate
School](Officer_Candidate_School_(U.S._Army) "wikilink") wear ascots as
part of their uniform, black for basic officer candidates, blue for
intermediate candidates, and white for senior officer candidates.[1]
[Pararescue](Pararescue "wikilink") trainees upon completion of extended
training day are given a blue ascot. In the [United States
Navy](United_States_Navy "wikilink") the ascot is now worn for
ceremonial purposes with [Enlisted Full Dress
Whites](Uniforms_of_the_United_States_Navy "wikilink") and Enlisted Full
Dress Blue in the [Ceremonial
Guard](Honor_guard#United_States "wikilink"). In the [Dutch
Army](Royal_Netherlands_Army "wikilink"), it is a part of the uniform,
for barrack use, the ascot is often in the weapon colors, and with a
logo, and when in combat uniform, a DPM or desert version is used.
Likewise the [Royal Danish Army](Royal_Danish_Army "wikilink") employs
an ascot for the ceremonial version of the barrack dress, its colors
vary between each company.
