A **head tie** is a women's cloth [head scarf](head_scarf "wikilink")
that is commonly worn in many parts of [Southern
Africa](Southern_Africa "wikilink") and [Western
Africa](Western_Africa "wikilink"). The head tie is used as an
ornamental head covering or [fashion
accessory](fashion_accessory "wikilink"), or for functionality in
different settings. Its use or meaning can vary depending on the country
and/or religion of those who wear it. In [South
Africa](South_Africa "wikilink") and [Namibia](Namibia "wikilink"), the
[Afrikaans](Afrikaans "wikilink") word ***doek***(meaning "cloth") is
used for the traditional head covering used among most elderly local
women in rural areas. In other parts of the continent, terms
like***duku***([Malawi](Malawi "wikilink"),
[Ghana](Ghana "wikilink")),***dhuku***([Zimbabwe](Zimbabwe "wikilink")),***tukwi***([Botswana](Botswana "wikilink")),
and***gele*** ([Nigeria](Nigeria "wikilink")) are used.

## West Africa

In Ghana, opportunity to wear a *duku* usually falls on a religious day
of Friday, Saturday or Sunday. This depends on whether the wearers are
Muslim, Seventh-Day Adventists or Sunday church-going Christians.

In Nigeria, the head-ties are known as *gele*, and can be rather large
and elaborate. Although the gele can be worn for day-to-day activities,
the elaborate ceremonial ones are worn to weddings, special events, and
church activities. It is usually made of a material that is firmer than
regular cloth. When worn, especially for more elaborate events, the gele
typically covers a woman's entire hair as well as her ears. The only
part exposed is her face and earrings on the lower part of her earlobes.
The gele is accompanied by traditional local attire that may or may not
have the same pattern as the headtie itself.

## Southern Africa

Malawian head-ties are usually small and conservative compared to the
Nigerian style. Women wear duku on special events like funeral. Urban
women with plaited hair wear also a duku when visiting the rural as
cultural respect. In addition, women may wear duku during sleep to
protect the hair.

In South African church services women may wear white "dukus" to cover
their heads. At the International Pentecostal churches in South Africa,
married women wear white 'dukus'.

The [Shangaan](Shangaan "wikilink") women in Zimbabwe and South Africa
wear 'dukus' as accessories.[1][2] At other social gatherings in
Zimbabwe women may wear a dhuku.[3]

According to Professor Hlonipha Mokoena of the Witwatersrand Institute
for Social and Economic Research,[4] historically the doek or headscarf
was imposed on black women in many colonies by convention or by law as a
way to control the sensuality and exoticism that “confused” white
men.[5] However, 2016 saw resurgence of wearing doeks through the
[#FeesMustFall](#FeesMustFall "wikilink") movement among students around
South Africa.[6][7]
