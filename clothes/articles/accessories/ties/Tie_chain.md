A **tie chain** is a [neckwear](necktie "wikilink")-controlling device.
Similar to [tie clips](Tie_clip "wikilink") and tie bars, it is used to
hold in place a tie to the underlying shirt front, ensuring that the tie
hangs straight. This accessory is composed of two parts, a durable clip
and a chain (typically of gold or silver). The clip attaches to a button
or attaches to the placket on the [shirt](dress_shirt "wikilink") and
when properly worn is covered entirely by the tie. The chain is then
left to rest across the necktie, keeping the tie secure.
