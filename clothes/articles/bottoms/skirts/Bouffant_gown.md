A **bouffant gown** is a women's dress silhouette made of a wide, full
skirt resembling a [hoop skirt](hoop_skirt "wikilink") (and sometimes
including a hoop or [petticoat](petticoat "wikilink") support underneath
the skirt). It may be [tea length](tea_length "wikilink") (mid-calf
length) or floor length.

Bouffant gowns were a popular silhouette during the mid-19th century. It
fell out of style by the end of the 19th century, but re-emerged in the
1930s, to appear in evening gowns during the 1930s and 1940s. It was
fully revived in tea-length designs in 1947 by [Christian
Dior](Christian_Dior "wikilink")'s [New
Look](Christian_Dior#The_New_Look "wikilink")
[couture](Haute_couture "wikilink") collection. The style remained very
popular at calf or ankle length throughout the 1950s.[1] It again fell
out of fashion during the 1960s and 1970s, as streamlined skirts became
associated with modern trends. The resurgence of Victorian styles during
the 1980s, as in the [wedding dress of Lady Diana
Spencer](wedding_dress_of_Lady_Diana_Spencer "wikilink") in 1981,
brought the bouffant gown back into style. Today, it is mainly seen in
wedding gowns, [Quinceañera](Quinceañera "wikilink") gowns, or [ball
gowns](ball_gown "wikilink"). The shape reaches its full effect if the
wearer has a thin frame,[2] allowing the fabric to drape and move
freely.
