A **Brunswick gown** or **Brunswick** is a two-piece woman's gown of the
mid-[eighteenth century](1750–1795_in_fashion "wikilink").

The Brunswick comprises a hip-length
[jacket](coat_(clothing) "wikilink") with a high neckline and a
[hood](hood_(headgear) "wikilink"), worn with a matching
[petticoat](petticoat "wikilink"). The jacket
[sleeves](sleeve "wikilink") consist of an upper sleeve with flounces at
the elbow and a tight, wrist-length lower sleeve.

The Brunswick is one of several informal jacket-and-petticoat costumes
popular in the later 18th century, derived from working class costume
but made up in fine fabrics.

Originating in [France](France "wikilink") (based on a German fashion),
the Brunswick was also popular in [England](England "wikilink") and the
[United States](United_States "wikilink") as a traveling costume.
