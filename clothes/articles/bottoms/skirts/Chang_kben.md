**Chang kben** (; , , ; , *pha hang*) is a lower-body, wrap-around cloth
worn in the countries of [Cambodia](Cambodia "wikilink"),
[Laos](Laos "wikilink"), and [Thailand](Thailand "wikilink"). It was the
preferred choice of clothing for women of upper and middle classes for
daily wear. The practice of daily wear died out at the beginning of the
20th century. Unlike the typical sampot, it is more of a
[pant](Trousers "wikilink") than a [skirt](skirt "wikilink"). It is a
rectangular piece of cloth measuring three meters long and one meter
wide. It is worn by wrapping it around the waist, stretching it away
from the body, twisting the ends together then pulling the twisted
fabric between the legs and tucking it in the back of the waist.

The history of sampot chang kben dates back to ancient
[Cambodia](Cambodia "wikilink"), where deities were often portrayed
wearing such styles. References to most Khmer elders told a legend
related to this garment. It said that a long time ago, the [Khmer
people](Khmer_people "wikilink") worn sampot chang kben, following the
[Indian](India "wikilink") tradition. In those times, India provided
many religions, but the most important one was
[Hinduism](Hinduism "wikilink"), as the Khmer king at that time built
the temples such as [Angkor Wat](Angkor_Wat "wikilink"), also dedicated
to [Hinduism](Hinduism "wikilink"). In the era of the [Khmer
empire](Khmer_empire "wikilink"), most of the people were likely to read
and see The [Reamker](Reamker "wikilink") at the [Angkor
Wat](Angkor_Wat "wikilink") carving in the first floor as well. The
origin of sampot chang kben is known as Indian. Also prayed and blessed
to was a deva known as [Hanuman](Hanuman "wikilink"), the guard of
Prince [Rama](Rama "wikilink") in India's famous mythology,
*[Ramayana](Ramayana "wikilink")*, as well as the Khmer adaptation,
*Reamker*. To show its power, Indians preferred to wear the sampot chang
kben as their costume but today, countries under the [Greater
India](Greater_India "wikilink"), such as Cambodia, also wear it for
special occasions.[1]

In Ramayana mythology, Hanuman is a symbol of bravery, cleverness, and
power, so the people, when wearing the sampot chang kben, always drop a
tail at the back like Hanuman's monkey tail. This practice lead a lot of
people to believe that all Indians were guards of Hanuman. The influence
of sampot chang kben, known as [Dhoti](Dhoti "wikilink") in
[India](India "wikilink"), were strongly incorporated into [Khmer
culture](Culture_of_Cambodia "wikilink") from the ancient times to
today. Apparently, this fabric is also known to be worn by [Tamil
people](Tamil_people "wikilink") in [south
India](south_India "wikilink"), as well as [Khmer
people](Khmer_people "wikilink"), till today.[2]

In fact, sampot chang kben is the tradition of [southern
India](southern_India "wikilink"), and was imported to early
[Cambodian](Cambodia "wikilink") Kingdom,
[Funan](Kingdom_of_Funan "wikilink") by *King Kaundinya I*.[3]

In the middle of the 13th and 14th centuries, [Thai
people](Thai_people "wikilink") (from [Sukhothai
Kingdom](Sukhothai_Kingdom "wikilink"), known as
[Thailand](Thailand "wikilink") today) and [Lao
people](Lao_people "wikilink") (from [Lan Xang](Lan_Xang "wikilink"),
known as Lao today) had adopted the wearing of sampot chang kben because
they considered it superior for enjoying the special occasions, and
useful for royalty or monarchy in their local royal palace, because the
[Thai people](Thai_people "wikilink") and [Lao
people](Lao_people "wikilink") had used sampot chang kben in a similar
way.[4]

In ancient times, the sampot chang kben was worn only by men, but in
modern times, it is worn by both men and women, especially for a formal
celebration. It is, for instance, worn by a bride and groom in a Khmer
wedding. The general style of the garment has changed over the years:

-   [King Norodom](Norodom_of_Cambodia "wikilink") (1834–1904), During
    this time, most people wearing the sampot chang kben kept the length
    down to the middle of the waist.[5]
-   [King Sisowath](Sisowath_of_Cambodia "wikilink") (born 1840, died
    1927), During this time, the sampot chang kben was worn higher up,
    just under the knee, like the model of [Thai
    people](Thai_people "wikilink"). In [Cambodia](Cambodia "wikilink")
    before, only men worn the garment, but in
    [Thailand](Thailand "wikilink") it was worn by both genders. When
    people from [Cambodia](Cambodia "wikilink") saw Thai ladies wearing
    the sampot chang kben, they began to adopt this practice.

Today, the sampot chang kben is worn mostly for formal occasions, or by
royalty.
