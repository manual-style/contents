***Chima*** is a type of skirt worn together with
*[jeogori](jeogori "wikilink")*, or a short jacket in
[hanbok](hanbok "wikilink"), [Korean](Korea "wikilink") traditional
clothing. It is also referred to as *sang* () or *gun* () in
[hanja](hanja "wikilink") in the [Korean
language](Korean_language "wikilink").[1][2][3]

## History

Basic forms of ancient Chima date back to the Goguryeo kingdom (37
BC-668 AD). The chima is one element of hanbok, which is Korean
traditional clothing. It is most commonly worn with the jeogori. While
hanbok has evolved overtime, the chima has remained relatively unchanged
throughout time.[4] Later on in the Goguryeo Kingdom, the jeogori became
shorter and shorter, showing off more of the chima.[5] The use of
primary colors in hanbok and more specifically in chima, led to the
Korean people often being nicknamed “the white people”.[6] Different
colors and lengths indicated important social distinctions such as: age,
marital status, and class.

## Silhouette

Chima is a floor length wrap around skirt with wide a waistband
positioned above the chest. With the high placement of the waistband it
allows the skirt to have a more billowy look, which can give greater
freedom of movement.[7] Traditionally, women needed to wear about five
to seven layers of undergarments which consisted of pants and
underskirts, this made the skirt look more voluminous and provide a more
elegant look.[8] However, modern women usually wear one layer of
undergarment typically pants.

There are different kinds of Chima: single-layered, double-layered, and
quilted. Furthermore, Pul-chima refers to a chima with a separated back,
whereas a tong-chima has a seamed back.[9] The upper class usually use
Ramie as the fabric to make for summer chimas while plain and patterned
silks are used throughout the remainder of the year.[10] By contrast,
commoners were restricted to using cotton for their chimas.[11] Women in
the upper class wore a long *chima* which falls down to the floor while
women in the lower class wore a shorter *chima* which length reaches to
the [calf](Calf_(anatomy) "wikilink") of the leg. Korean noblewomen wore
full length chima to designate their social status.

## Color

Girls and unmarried women usually wore red skirts, while married women
and middle-aged women wore blue skirts and elderly women wore gray
skirts.[12] In addition, Goguryeo women also wore *[saekdong
chima](saekdong_chima "wikilink")* that is a colorfully striped skirt by
[patchworking](Patchwork "wikilink"), and a *chima* in form of
[gored](Gore_(segment) "wikilink") skirt, made by sewing several pieces
of fabric without
[gathering](Gathering_(sewing) "wikilink").[<sup>\[3\]</sup>](Chima_(clothing)#cite_note-Doosan-3 "wikilink")
