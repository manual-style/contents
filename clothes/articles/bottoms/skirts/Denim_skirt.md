**denim skirt**, sometimes referred to as a 'jean skirt' or 'jeans
skirt', is a [skirt](skirt "wikilink") made of
[denim](denim "wikilink"), the same material as [blue
jeans](Jeans "wikilink").[1] Denim skirts come in a variety of styles
and lengths to suit different populations and occasions. For example,
full-length denim skirts are commonly worn by [women](women "wikilink")
whose [religious beliefs prohibit them from wearing
trousers](women_wearing_pants#Religion "wikilink"), including [Orthodox
Jews](Orthodox_Jew "wikilink"), some [Muslims](Muslim "wikilink"),
[Mennonites](Mennonite "wikilink"), and
[Pentecostals](Pentecostal "wikilink"), among others. [Shorter
skirts](Miniskirt "wikilink") made of denim are commonly worn by
[teenagers](teenager "wikilink") and young adults.

Some are modeled after an exact style of [jeans](jeans "wikilink"), with
a front [fly](fly_(clothing) "wikilink"), [belt
loops](belt_loop "wikilink"), and back pockets. Others are constructed
more like other types of skirts, with a column of front button,
[closures on the side or back](back_closure "wikilink"), or elastic
waists. Like jeans, denim skirts vary in shades of blue, ranging from
very pale to very dark, or occasionally in other colors. During winter
and colder months, denim skirts are often worn with
[leggings](leggings "wikilink") or [tights](tights "wikilink").

## History

In the 1960s, [hippies](hippie "wikilink") first came up with the idea
of recycling old denim jeans into long denim skirts,[2][3] by opening
the inseams, and inserting pieces of triangular denim (or any other
fabric) in the front and, unless a tall slit in back is preferred, also
in the back of the opened-up trousers.[4]

Denim skirts were first introduced in mainstream fashion lines in the
1970s, and since then have grown in popularity. Circa-1983, denim
[miniskirts](miniskirt "wikilink")—with a [pencil
skirt](pencil_skirt "wikilink") silhouette—became a popular teenage
fashion. They were initially in darker blues, but eventually pinstripes
(light blue on darker blue, red on black) and [acid
wash](acid_wash "wikilink"). The trend faded in the late 1980s when knit
miniskirts were dominant.

The popularity of denim skirts waned in the tail end of the 1980s until
re-emerging in the latter portion of the 1990s. Marnie Bjornson, a
well-known figure in the Reykjavik style scene, is credited with
reinvigorating the denim skirt in 1996.[5] The same year, [Pamela
Anderson](Pamela_Anderson "wikilink") wore a light washed denim skirt in
a promotional photo shoot for the film [Barb
Wire](Barb_Wire_(film) "wikilink").[6][7] The denim miniskirt of the
early 21st century was shorter than its 1980s counterpart.[8][9]

## Styles of denim skirt

The classic style of a denim skirt resembles a common pair of jeans,
with a front fly, a fitted waist, belt loops, and pockets. There have
been a large number of other styles constructed over time to resemble
other types of skirts.

Several types of skirts are more common in denim than in other
fabrics—they typically include skirts with a variety of panels, going
beyond the four panels most common with other fabrics. These include
chevron, diagonal, diamond, horizontal, multiple vertical panels, and
combinations of the above. Denim skirts not made from pants are often
designed as though they were made from pants, i.e. with front and back
triangular denim panels.

To tone down the rough and somewhat masculine look of the denim fabric,
denim skirts are sometimes designed with alternating cloth panels, which
can be diagonal, triangular, vertical, or there can be cloth panel trim
at the bottom of the skirt. Also, to make the skirt look more feminine,
denim skirts are (more often than skirts made from other fabrics),
trimmed with fringes, lace, leather fringes, or decorated with
embroidery, patchwork, rhinestones, writing, or even painting. Prints
are quite rare on denim skirts. Deviating from the front fly and button
closure is common though, with [back or side
zippers](back_closure "wikilink") or a column of front buttons (on a
"fake" fly) being common.

One style denim skirts share with jeans is the ripped or destroyed look,
which is more common with short denim skirts than with long ones.

Another style shared with jeans and jeans cutoffs, but maybe even more
popular in denim skirts, is the rough hem. This is achieved by not
hemming the skirt (or undoing or cutting off the existing hem) and
washing the skirt by machine several times. The resulting edge of the
skirt will have a frayed or unraveling look, popular with teenagers and
young women. The longer unraveled threads are usually cut off for an
even fuzzy look, but some teenagers leave them hanging on their shorter
skirts.
