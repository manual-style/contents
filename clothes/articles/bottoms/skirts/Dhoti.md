![](Shad_Suk_Mysiem.JPG "fig:Shad_Suk_Mysiem.JPG") The **dhoti**, also
known as **panche**, **vesti**, **dhuti**, **mardani**, **chaadra**,
**dhotar**, **panchey**, is a traditional men's garment worn in the
[Indian subcontinent](Indian_subcontinent "wikilink"). It is a
rectangular piece of unstitched cloth, usually around long, wrapped
around the waist and the legs and knotted at the waist.

## Etymology

The word *dhoti* is derived from *dhauti*
([Sanskrit](Sanskrit_language "wikilink"): धौती), meaning to "cleanse or
wash".[1] In the context of clothing, it simply refers to the cleansed
garment which was worn as part of everyday attire[2] The dhoti evolved
from the ancient [antriya](antriya "wikilink") which was passed through
the legs, tucked at the back and covered the legs loosely, then flowed
into long pleats at front of the legs, the same way it is worn today.[3]

## Custom and usage

Dhoti is usually worn over a [kaupinam](kaupinam "wikilink") or
[langot](langot "wikilink"), types of [loincloth](loincloth "wikilink")
undergarments. The *pancha* is worn by many orthodox
[Jain](Jain "wikilink") men when they visit the temple for
[puja](puja_(Jainism) "wikilink"); unstitched clothing is believed by
some Jains to be "less permeable to pollution" and therefore more
appropriate for religious rituals than other garments.[4] They also wear
a loose, unstitched cloth, shorter than the *pancha*, on top.

It is the national dress of the [Madhesh](Madhesh "wikilink") region of
southern Nepal, worn mainly by [Nepalis](Nepalese_people "wikilink") of
[Madhesi](Madhesi_people "wikilink"), [Tharu](Tharu_people "wikilink")
and [Maithali](Maithali "wikilink") ethnicity.[5]

[Hare
Krishna](International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness "wikilink"),
known for its distinctive dress code, prompts Western adherents to wear
*pancha*, usually of [saffron](saffron "wikilink") or white cloth folded
in a traditional style. [Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi](Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi "wikilink") was known for wearing a white
silk dhoti.[6]

In India, there's a distinction between the [lungi](lungi "wikilink"), a
similar but smaller garment often worn by people at their home as it is
more casual and comfortable than dhoti, and the more formal dhoti that
is sometimes worn by politicians.[7]
