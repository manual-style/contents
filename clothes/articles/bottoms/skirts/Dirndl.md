A **dirndl** (,[1][2] ) [3] is the name of a traditional feminine
[dress](dress "wikilink") worn in [Bavaria](Bavaria "wikilink") and
[Austria](Austria "wikilink") (except for
[Vorarlberg](Vorarlberg "wikilink")), [Altbayern](Altbayern "wikilink"),
and [Südtirol](Südtirol "wikilink"). It is a type of
[Tracht](Tracht "wikilink") which is based on traditional clothing of
[Alps](Alps "wikilink") peasants.[4][5][6] Dresses that are loosely
based on the dirndl are known as *Landhausmode* ("country-inspired
fashion").

A **dirndl skirt** generally describes a light circular-cut dress,
gathered at the waist, that falls below the knee.[7][8]

## Description

The dirndl consists of a [bodice](bodice "wikilink") and skirt or a
pinafore dress, a low-cut [blouse](blouse "wikilink") with short puff
sleeves, full [skirt](skirt "wikilink"), and
[apron](apron "wikilink").[9][10][11] While appearing to be simple and
plain, a properly made modern dirndl may be quite expensive as it is
tailored, and sometimes cut from costly hand-printed or silk
fabrics.[12][13]

The winter style dirndl has heavy, warm skirts and aprons made of thick
[cotton](cotton "wikilink"), [linen](linen "wikilink"),
[velvet](velvet "wikilink") or [wool](wool "wikilink"), and long
sleeves. The colors are usually rich and dark. The summer style is
lighter and more revealing, has short sleeves, and is often made of
lightweight cotton.

Accessories may include a long apron tied round the waist, a
[waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink") or a wool [shawl](shawl "wikilink").
In many regions, especially the [Ausseerland](Altaussee "wikilink"),
vibrantly colored, hand-printed silk scarfs and silk aprons are worn.
Women often wear necklaces, earrings and brooches made of silver, the
antlers of deer or even animals' teeth. For colder weather there are
heavy dirndl coats in the same cut as the dresses, with a high neck and
front buttons, thick mittens and wool hats.

Different [styles](Fashion "wikilink") were worn in different
regions,[14] but they are now more universally generalized.[15]

### Dirndl vs. Tracht and traditional folk costumes

of [Gutach](Gutach_(Schwarzwaldbahn) "wikilink") in the [Black
Forest](Black_Forest "wikilink"), around 1900, the red colour of the
pompons indicates that the woman was unmarried\]\]

The typical dirndl and folk costume varies from one region, or even
village, to another. Folk costume has various details according to the
place of origin and social status of the wearer. The modern dirndl is
heavily stylized but clearly influenced by typical Bavarian costume.
There is also a distinction between the typical dirndl (that is, a
garment with an apron made of material with traditional patterns and
embroidery) and rural domestic clothing, made from gray or colored
linen, sometimes with leather bodice and trim.[16]

## History

![](Bundesarchiv_Bild_119-5592-12A,_Mädchen_mit_spielenden_Kindern.jpg "Bundesarchiv_Bild_119-5592-12A,_Mädchen_mit_spielenden_Kindern.jpg")

### Origins

The dirndl originated as a more hardy form of the costume worn today:
the uniform of Austrian [domestic workers](domestic_worker "wikilink")
during the nineteenth century. Simple forms were also worn commonly by
working women in plain colors or a simple check. The Austrian upper
classes adopted the dirndl as high fashion in the 1870s, making it a
highly fashionable and popular must-have item in the nation soon
after.[17]

Both skirts and pinafore dresses with vest-shaped tank tops, cooking
aprons, and blouses were commonplace in Europe in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries.[18]

The basic blouse-skirt-corset idea came from the eastern regions of the
[Swiss Alps](Swiss_Alps "wikilink"), and was originally simple rural
clothing. It became female Austrian servant [work
clothes](work_clothes "wikilink") as well as Alpine peasant attire in
the eighteenth century and exclusively servant's work clothes in the
nineteenth century.[19]

It appeared in its current state of decorative format and style in
eastern Switzerland in the 1890s, and spread in the early twentieth
century[20] to the south of Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein,[21][22]
South Tirol, Trentino, and Valcanale Friuli.

### Modern European usage

in 2012\]\]

Dirndls and *Landhausmode* were abandoned for a while after World War
II. While the wearing of the corresponding garments was scarcely popular
in the 1970s, it has grown strongly since the
1990s.[23][24][25][26][27][28]

In the twenty-first century, fashion designers have adopted the dirndl,
with varying results.[29][30][31][32] It has become a popular Upper
Tyrol and Bavarian fashion[33][34] and regular party outfit during
[Oktoberfest](Oktoberfest "wikilink").[35][36] .[37][38][39] There the
Dirndl is more common with skirts ending more above the knee, bodice
just reaching to below the breasts, and dirndl-blouses with deep
neckline and bare shoulders.

In Switzerland, the dirndl is the official outfit for certain
representations, events, cultural shows, and while singing old folk
songs often involving yodeling.[40][41]

Today, dirndls vary from simple off-the-shelf styles to exquisitely
crafted, very expensive models.[42][43][44]

Several versions and even disjointed dresses that are loosely based on
the dirndl are known as *Landhausmode* (literally "country house style")
dresses.[45][46] [47][48][49][50][51][52][53] The children's version is
called *Mädchenkleid* (girl's dress).

Germany and Austria have many manufacturers of the outfits. Both the
open-collar and closed-collar versions are popular in those countries.

In Austria, and other parts of south central Europe, there are literally
splashy events known as Dirndlspringen, in which people, overwhelmingly
attractive young women, are judged by how well they dive from a diving
board into a lake or a swimming pool while wearing the dirndl.

### North American usage

Germans, Austrian, Swiss, and Scandinavians people migrated to North
America in the nineteenth century. Germans made a strong contribution to
the gene pool of Montana, Minnesota, the Dakotas, Missouri, Wisconsin,
Ohio, New York City,[54] and Chicago. The [German
American](German_American "wikilink") ethnic group (German:
Deutschamerikaner) are their descendants in North America.[55][56]
Beginning in 1920 and especially after World War II, many [Danube
Swabians](Danube_Swabians "wikilink") migrated to the United States,
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Austria, Australia, and Argentina.[57]

Across the United States there are dozens of German-American cultural or
heritage clubs, such as the Donauschwaben heritage clubs.[58] In these
clubs, members host events and festivals to preserve and/or celebrate
their heritage with the surrounding communities. During these festivals,
participants often dress in traditional outfits such as dirndls and
[lederhosen](lederhosen "wikilink").

## Name

In the South German dialects ([Bairisch](Austro-Bavarian "wikilink")),
*Dirndl* originally referred to a young woman or a girl, while the word
*Dirndlgewand* referred to the dress.[59] Nowadays, *Dirndl* may equally
refer to either a young woman or to the dress.[60] *Dirndl* is a
diminutive form of the dated word *Dirn(e)* for "girl"; in the twentieth
century, *Dirne* (originally a euphemism) has also developed toward
meaning "prostitute".[61] The word is *Dirn* in standardized German and
*Deern* in Low Saxon.[62][63]

## Dressing etiquette

In [Austria](Austria "wikilink") and [Bavaria](Bavaria "wikilink"),
where the Dirndl is mostly worn. It is used as an everyday dress
primarily by older women in rural areas. Other women may wear it at
formal occasions (similar to a [Scotsman](Scotland "wikilink") wearing a
[kilt](kilt "wikilink")) and during certain traditional events. It is
hugely popular also among young women at the time of a
*[Volksfest](Volksfest "wikilink")*, such as the
[Oktoberfest](Oktoberfest "wikilink") in [Munich](Munich "wikilink")
(and similar festivals),[64][65][66] although many women will only wear
dirndl-style dresses, called *Landhausmode*, which may deviate in
numerous ways and are often much cheaper.

In Austria and Bavaria, the dirndl may often be seen on women working in
tourism-related businesses, and sometimes waitresses in
traditional-style restaurants or [beer gardens](beer_garden "wikilink").
It is also seen in these regions on women in the
*[Volksmusik](Volksmusik "wikilink")* business.

There is an [urban legend](urban_legend "wikilink") that claims the
placement of the [knot](knot "wikilink") on the apron is an indicator of
the woman's marital status.[67][68] In this story, which is not based in
tradition, tying the sash on the woman's left side indicates that she is
single, and a knot tied on the right means that she is married, engaged,
or otherwise not interested in dating.[69][70]
