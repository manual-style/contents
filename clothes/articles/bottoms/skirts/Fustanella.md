**Fustanella** (for spelling in various languages, see [chart
below](#Name_in_various_languages "wikilink")) is a traditional
[pleated](pleat "wikilink") [skirt](skirt "wikilink")-like
[garment](Clothing "wikilink") that is also referred to as a
[kilt](kilt "wikilink") worn by men of many nations in the
[Balkans](Balkans "wikilink") ([Southeast
Europe](Southeast_Europe "wikilink")). In modern times, the fustanella
is part of Balkan folk dresses. In [Greece](Greece "wikilink"), a short
version of the fustanella is worn by ceremonial military units such as
the [Evzones](Evzones "wikilink"), while in
[Albania](Albania "wikilink") it was worn by the [Royal
Guard](Royal_Albanian_Army#Royal_Guard "wikilink") in the
[interbellum](interbellum "wikilink") era. Both Greece and Albania claim
the fustanella as a national costume.[1] Additionally
[Aromanians](Aromanians "wikilink") ([Vlachs](Vlachs "wikilink")) claim
the fustanella as their ethnic costume.[2]

## Origins

![](Young_man_exomis_Musei_Capitolini_MC892.jpg "fig:Young_man_exomis_Musei_Capitolini_MC892.jpg")
![](Nympholept.jpg "fig:Nympholept.jpg"), Archedemus the
[Nympholept](Nympholepsy "wikilink"), wearing a fustanella-like
garment.\]\]

Some scholars state that the fustanella was derived from a series of
[ancient Greek](Ancient_Greece "wikilink") garments such as the
[chiton](chiton_(costume) "wikilink") (or tunic) and the chitonium (or
short military tunic).[3][4][5] Although the pleated skirt has been
linked to an ancient statue (3rd century BC) located in the area around
the [Acropolis](Acropolis "wikilink") in
[Athens](Athens,_Greece "wikilink"), there is no surviving ancient Greek
clothing that can confirm this connection.[6] However, a 5th-century BC
relief statue was discovered in [Vari Cave](Vari_Cave "wikilink"),
[Attica](Attica "wikilink"), by Charles Heald Weller of the [American
School of Classical Studies at
Athens](American_School_of_Classical_Studies_at_Athens "wikilink")
depicting a stonecutter, Archedemus the
[Nympholept](Nympholepsy "wikilink"), wearing a fustanella-like
garment.[7] The [Roman](Ancient_Rome "wikilink") [toga](toga "wikilink")
may have also influenced the evolution of the fustanella based on
statues of Roman emperors wearing knee-length pleated skirts (in colder
regions, more folds were added to provide greater warmth).[8] Folklorist
Ioanna Papantoniou considers the Celtic kilt, as viewed by the [Roman
legions](Roman_legions "wikilink"), to have served as a prototype.[9]
[Sir Arthur Evans](Sir_Arthur_Evans "wikilink") considered the
fustanella of the female peasants (worn over and above the Slavonic
apron) living near the modern
[Bosnian](Bosnia "wikilink")-[Montenegrin](Montenegro "wikilink")
borders as a preserved [Illyrian element](Illyrians "wikilink") among
the local Slavic-speaking populations.[10]

In the [Byzantine Empire](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink"), a pleated skirt
known as the *[podea](podea "wikilink")* (Greek: ποδέα) was
worn.[11][12] The wearer of the podea was either associated with a
typical hero or an [Akritic warrior](Akrites "wikilink") and can be
found in 12th-century finds attributed to Emperor [Manuel I
Komnenos](Manuel_I_Komnenos "wikilink") (r. 1143–1180).[13] On Byzantine
[pottery sherds](pottery_sherds "wikilink"),
[warriors](warrior "wikilink") are shown bearing weapons and wearing the
heavy pleated fustanella, including a
[mace-bearer](mace-bearer "wikilink") clad in
[chain-mail](chain-mail "wikilink").[14]

In his *Lexicon of Medieval Latin*, [Charles du
Fresne](Charles_du_Fresne,_sieur_du_Cange "wikilink") suggests that
*fustanum* (a piece of cloth) originates from the Roman *palla*.[15]
Cotton *fustana* was among the belongings of [Pope Urban
V](Pope_Urban_V "wikilink") (1310–1370).[16]

## Evolution

### Greece

![](12th_century_Greek_Warrior_Fustanella.JPG "fig:12th_century_Greek_Warrior_Fustanella.JPG"),
[Greece](Greece "wikilink").[17]\]\]

[Archaeological evidence](Archaeological_record "wikilink") shows that
the fustanella was already in common use in Greek lands as early as the
12th century.[18] [Byzantine](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink") warriors, in
particular the [Akritai](Akritai "wikilink"), wearing fustanella are
depicted in contemporary [Byzantine art](Byzantine_art "wikilink").[19]
This is also confirmed by the [Medieval
Greek](Medieval_Greek "wikilink") [acritic
songs](acritic_songs "wikilink") of the 12th century.[20] The
full-pleated fustanella was worn from the Byzantine
[Akritic](Akritai "wikilink") warriors originally as a military outfit
and seems to have been reserved for persons of importance.[21][22] It
was frequently worn in conjunction with
[bows](bow_and_arrow "wikilink"), [swords](sword "wikilink"), or
[battle-axes](Battle_axe "wikilink") and frequently shown covered with a
jointed [corselet](corselet "wikilink"), or with a vest of [chain
mail](chain_mail "wikilink").[23]

According to another view the fustanella is thought originally to have
been a [Tosk Albanian](Tosks "wikilink") costume introduced into Greek
territories during the Ottoman period.[24][25][26][27][28][29] During
the Ottoman period, the fustanella was also worn by the
[klephts](klephts "wikilink") and the
[armatoloi](armatoloi "wikilink").[30] Fustanella was a suitable garment
for guerrilla mountain units, thus it was worn by the klephts of the
Ottoman period for the same reason it was worn by the akritai warriors
of the Byzantine era earlier.[31] According to some scholars, it
subsequently became part of the national dress of Greece as a
consequence of the migration and settlement of
[Albanians](Albanians "wikilink") in the region.[32][33][34]

In the early 19th century, the costume's popularity rose among the Greek
population.[35][36] During this era of post-independence Greece, parts
of Greek society such as townspeople shed their Turkish-style clothing
and adopted the fustanella which symbolised solidarity with new Greek
democracy.[37] It became difficult thereafter to distinguish the
fustanella as clothing worn by male Arvanites from clothing worn by
wider parts of Greek society.[38] According to Helen
Angelomatis-Tsougarakis, its popularity in the [Morea](Morea "wikilink")
(Peloponnese) was attributed to the influence of the
[Arvanite](Arvanitika "wikilink") community of
[Hydra](Hydra_(island) "wikilink") and other Albanian-speaking
settlements in the area.[39] The Hydriotes however could not have played
a significant role in its development since they did not wear the
fustanella, but similar costumes to the other Greek islanders.[40] In
other regions of Greece the popularity of the fustanella was attributed
to the elevation of Albanians as an Ottoman ruling class such as [Ali
Pasha](Ali_Pasha_of_Yanina "wikilink"), the semi-independent ruler of
the [Pashalik of Yanina](Pashalik_of_Yanina "wikilink").[41] In those
areas, its lightweight design and manageability in comparison to the
clothing of the Greek upper classes of the era also made it fashionable
amongst them in adopting the fustanella.[42]

The fustanella worn by the [Roumeliotes](Roumeliotes "wikilink") (Greeks
of the mountainous interior) was the version chosen as the national
costume of Greece in the early 19th century.[43] Of the Roumeliotes, the
nomadic Greek speaking [Sarakatsani](Sarakatsani "wikilink")
pastoralists wore the fustanella.[44] The
[Aromanians](Aromanians "wikilink"), a Latin speaking people who within
Greece also wore the fustanella.[45] During the reign of King [Othon
I](Otto_of_Greece "wikilink") (1832–1862), the fustanella was adopted by
the king, the royal court and the military, while it became a service
uniform imposed on government officials to wear even when
abroad.[46][47] In terms of geographical spread, the fustanella never
became part of the clothing worn in the [Aegean
islands](Aegean_islands "wikilink"), whereas in
[Crete](Crete "wikilink") it was associated with the heroes of the Greek
War of Independence (1821) in local theatrical productions and seldom as
a government uniform.[48] By the late 19th century, the popularity of
the fustanella in Greece began to fade when Western-style clothing was
introduced.[49][50]

The fustanella film (or fustanella drama) was a popular genre in the
[Greek cinema](Cinema_of_Greece "wikilink") from 1930s to 1960s.[51]
This genre emphasized on depictions of rural Greece and was focused on
the differences between rural and urban Greece. In general it offered an
idealized depiction of the Greek village, where the fustanella was a
typical image.[52] In Greece today, the garment is seen a relic of a
past era with which most members of the younger generations do not
identify.[53]

The Greek fustanella differs from the Albanian fustanella in that the
former garment has a higher number of pleats. For example, the
"Bridegroom's coat", worn throughout the districts of Attica and
Boeotia, was a type of Greek fustanella unique for its 200 pleats; a
bride would purchase it as a wedding gift for her groom (if she could
afford the garment).[54] A fustanella is worn with a *yileki* (bolero),
a *mendani* (waistcoat) and a *fermeli* (sleeveless coat). The *selachi*
(leather belt) with gold or silver embroidery, is worn around the waist
over the fustanella, in which the armatoles and the klephts placed their
arms.[55]

During the 18th and early 19th centuries, the skirts hung below the
knees and the hem of the garment was gathered together with
[garters](garters "wikilink") while tucked into the boots to create a
"bloused" effect. Later, during the [Bavarian
regency](History_of_Modern_Greece##Reign_of_King_Othon "wikilink"), the
skirts were shortened to create a sort of billowy
[pantaloon](trousers "wikilink") that stopped above the knee; this
garment was worn with [hose](hose_(clothing) "wikilink"), and either
[buskins](buskin "wikilink") or decorative [clogs](clogs "wikilink").
This is the costume worn by the [Evzones](Evzones "wikilink"), light
mountain troops of the [Hellenic Army](Hellenic_Army "wikilink"). Today
it is still worn by the ceremonial [Presidential
Guard](Presidential_Guard_(Greece) "wikilink").

### Albania

![](Albanian_fustanella_-_1850_-_1900.jpg "fig:Albanian_fustanella_-_1850_-_1900.jpg")
A 14th-century document (1335 AD) listing a series of items including a
*[fustanum](fustanum "wikilink")* (a cloth made of
[cotton](cotton "wikilink")), which were confiscated from a
[sailor](sailor "wikilink") at the port of the [Drin
River](Drin_(river) "wikilink") in the [Skadar
Lake](Skadar_Lake "wikilink") region of Albania.[56] During the Ottoman
conquest of Albania in the late 15th century, Albanian
[Tosks](Tosks "wikilink") who arrived in southern Italy wore the
fustanella which distinguished them from Albanian
[Ghegs](Ghegs "wikilink") who wore tight breeches.[57] In the 19th
century, within the area of contemporary southern Albania and northern
Greek [Epirus](Epirus_(region) "wikilink"), British traveler [John Cam
Hobhouse](John_Cam_Hobhouse "wikilink") noticed that when traveling from
the Greek-speaking area (region south of
[Delvinaki](Delvinaki "wikilink")) into the Albanian-speaking area (to
the direction of [Gjirokastër](Gjirokastër "wikilink") and its
surrounding environs), apart from different languages a change of
clothing occurred.[58] Those Albanian speakers wore the Kamisa shirt and
kilt, while Greek speakers wore woolen brogues.[59]

![](Lord_Byron_in_Albanian_Dress_by_Phillips,_1813.jpg "fig:Lord_Byron_in_Albanian_Dress_by_Phillips,_1813.jpg")
in 1813. Venizelos Mansion, Athens (the British Ambassador's
residence)\]\] Other British travelers within the region such as [Lord
Byron](Lord_Byron "wikilink") celebrated the Albanian costume and
described it as "the most magnificent in the world, consisting of long,
white kilt, gold-worked cloak, crimson velvet gold laced jacket and
waist-coat, silver mounted pistols and daggers".[60] In 1848–1849,
British painter [Edward Lear](Edward_Lear "wikilink") traveling within
the area of contemporary Albania observed that the fustanella was for
Albanians a characteristic national costume.[61] While during the 19th
century the use of the fustanella was worn over tight fitting *tirq*
pants amongst male Albanian Ghegs by village groups of the
[Malësorë](Malësia "wikilink") or highlanders of the
[Kelmend](Kelmend "wikilink"), [Berisha](Berisha_(tribe) "wikilink"),
[Shala](Shala_(tribe) "wikilink") and [Hoti](Hoti_(tribe) "wikilink")
tribes.[62] They reserved use of the fustanella for elites during
important and formal occasions such as dispute resolutions, election of
local tribal representatives and allegiance declarations.[63] In the
middle of the 19th century, Albanian guerilla fighters abandoned the
Turkish pants and begun wearing a kilt similar to the fustanella of the
Greek Evzones.[64] During the 1920s, the fustanella began to go out of
fashion among Tosks being replaced with Western style clothing made by
local tailors.[65]

![](Arnaut_smoking-large1865.jpg "fig:Arnaut_smoking-large1865.jpg")
(Turkish for [Albanian](Albanians "wikilink")) Smoking, [Jean-Léon
Gérôme](Jean-Léon_Gérôme "wikilink"), 1865\]\] The Albanian fustanella
has around sixty pleats, or usually a moderate number.[66] It is made of
heavy home-woven linen cloth.[67] Historically, the skirt was long
enough to cover the whole thigh (knee included), leaving only the lower
leg exposed.[68] It was usually worn by wealthy Albanians who would also
expose an ornamented [yataghan](yataghan "wikilink") on the side and a
pair of pistols with long-chiseled silver handles in the belt.[69] The
general custom in Albania was to dip the white skirts in melted
sheep-fat for the double purpose of making them waterproof and less
visible at a distance.[70] Usually, this was done by the men-at-arms
(called in Albanian *trima*).[71] After being removed from the cauldron,
the skirts were hung up to dry and then pressed with cold irons so as to
create the pleats.[72] They then had a dull gray appearance but were not
dirty by any means.[73] The jacket, worn with the fustanella in the
Albanian costume, has a free armhole to allow for the passage of the
arm, while the sleeves, attached only on the upper part of the
shoulders, are thrown back.[74] The sleeves are not usually worn even
though the wearer has the option of putting them on.[75] There are three
types of footwear that complement the fustanella: 1) the *kundra*, which
are black shoes with a metal buckle, 2) the *sholla*, which are sandals
with leather thongs tied around a few inches above the ankle, 3) the
*opinga*, which is a soft leather shoe, with turned-up points, which,
when intended for children, are surmounted with a pompon of black or red
wool.[76]

Among the Greek population in southern Albania, a *sigouni*, a
sleeveless coat made of thick white wool, is worn over the fustanella in
the regions of [Dropull](Dropull "wikilink") and
[Tepelenë](Tepelenë "wikilink").[77] In 1914, the newly formed Greek
armed forces of the [Autonomous Republic of Northern
Epirus](Autonomous_Republic_of_Northern_Epirus "wikilink") (1913-1914)
consisted of military units wearing Evzone uniforms.[78]

### Aromanians

<img src="Vlach_Shepherd.png" title="fig:Vlach_Shepherd.png" width="150" alt="Vlach_Shepherd.png" />
The [Aromanians](Aromanians "wikilink") are the [Eastern
Romance](Eastern_Romance_languages "wikilink")-speaking peoples who live
south of the [Danube](Danube "wikilink") in what are now Serbia,
Albania, northern Greece, North Macedonia, and southwestern Bulgaria, as
indigenous ethnic groups, known as
[Megleno-Romanians](Megleno-Romanians "wikilink") (Macedoromanians), and
Macedo-Vlachs. In Aromanian rural areas, clothes differed from the dress
of the city dwellers. The shape and the colour of a garment, the volume
of the headgear, the shape of a jewel could indicate cultural
affiliation and also could show the village people came from[79]

### North Macedonia

In [North Macedonia](North_Macedonia "wikilink"), the fustanella was
worn in the regions of [Azot](Azot_(region) "wikilink"), Babuna,
[Gevgelija](Gevgelija_Municipality "wikilink"), the southern area of the
[South Morava](South_Morava "wikilink"), [Ovče
Pole](Ovče_Pole "wikilink"), [Lake Prespa](Lake_Prespa "wikilink"),
Skopska Blatija, and [Tikveš](Tikveš "wikilink"). In that area, it is
known as *fustan*, *ajta*, and *toska*. The use of the term *toska*
could be attributed to the hypothesis that the costume was introduced to
certain regions within [Macedonia](Macedonia_(region) "wikilink") as a
cultural borrowing from the Albanians of Toskëria (subregion of southern
Albania).[80]

## Status and practicality

While the image of warriors with frilly skirts tucked into their boots
may seem impractical to a contemporary audience, modern
[paratroopers](paratrooper "wikilink") use a similar method to blouse
their trousers over their jumpboots.[81] [Lace](Lace "wikilink") was
commonly worn on military uniforms in the West well into the 19th
century, and [gold braids](gold_braid "wikilink") and other adornments
still serve as markers of high rank in formal military uniforms.
Fustanella were very labor-intensive and thus costly, which made them a
high status garment that advertised the wealth and importance of the
wearer. Western observers of the [Greek War of
Independence](Greek_War_of_Independence "wikilink") noted the great
pride which the klephts and armatoloi took in their fustanella, and how
they competed to outdo each other in the sumptuousness of their costume.

## Name

The word derives from [Italian](Italian_language "wikilink") *fustagno*
'[fustian](fustian "wikilink")' and *-ella* (diminutive), the fabric
from which the earliest fustanella were made. This in turn derives from
[Medieval Latin](Medieval_Latin "wikilink") *fūstāneum*, perhaps a
[diminutive](diminutive "wikilink") form of *fustis*, "wooden baton".
Other authors consider this a [calque](calque "wikilink") of
[Greek](Greek_language "wikilink") *xylino* (ξύλινο), literally "wooden"
i.e. "cotton";[82] others speculate that it is derived from
[Fostat](Fostat "wikilink"), a suburb of [Cairo](Cairo "wikilink") where
cloth was manufactured.[83] The Greek plural is *foustanelles* (Greek:
φουστανέλλες) but as with the (semi-correct) *foustanellas*, it is
rarely employed by native English speakers.

military tunic), fastened by a belt round the waist and falling into
narrow regular folds, is derived the *fustanella* which by extension
gives its name to the whole of the costume."

skirt (sometimes called a fustanella) attributed to Manuel I, the "new
Akrites," in a Ptochoprodromic poem, and 26 have him slaying a dragon,
neither iconographic element is sufficient to identify the hero
specifically as Digenes because both the skirt and the deed characterize
other *akritai* named in the Akritic Songs."

mace-bearer of No. 1275 is clad in chain mail with a heavy pleated
fustanella worn about his hips. The importance of this latter piece is
very considerable, for the details of the costume, often shown on
Incised-Sgraffito figures, are very clear, and make it certain that the
fustanella exists as an independent garment and is not an elaboration of
the lower part of a tunic. It is consequently demonstrable that this
characteristic garment of latter-day Greece was in common use as early
as the twelfth century in Greek lands."

[22] : "They are not clad in armor, nor in helmets. They wear a cap, a
cloth doublet, and their pleated kilt is unmistakably different from
that of the other class of warriors. Their kilt resembles the klepht
fustanella; it is longer, more flared, fluid, and ornamented with
decorative stripes, horizontal or vertical. It is this difference in
kilts that distinguishes the warriors in the Byzantine plates from the
imperial forces depicted in other manifestations of Byzantine art. The
kilts in our plates belong to the akrites, whose garb is required by
their way of life and the guerrilla type of warfare described in the
Byzantine military treatise."

[25] : "Thought originally to have been a southern Albanian outfit worn
by men of the Tosk ethnicity and introduced into more Greek territories
during the Ottoman occupation of previous centuries, the "clean
petticoat" of the foustanéla ensemble was a term of reproach used by
brigands well before laografia (laographía, folklore) and disuse made it
the national costume of Greece and consequently made light of variations
based on region, time period, class or ethnicity."

[43] : "The Aegean, the Peloponnese and the Roumeliotes of the
mountainous interior each claimed precedence based on their records of
trials and exploits during the War of Independence. The political muscle
of the latter ensured that their traditional dress (fustanella) was
chosen as the national costume; it has remained a universal emblem of
Greekness."

[55] : "The *yileki* (bolero), the *mendani* (waistcoat) and the
*fermeli* (sleeveless coat) which are worn with the *fustanella*, and
their mode of decoration, are reminiscent of the ornamented breastplates
of ancient times. The *selachi* (leather belt) with its gold or silver
embroidery, worn round the waist over the *fustanella*, and in whose
pouches the armed chieftains, the *Armatoli* and *Klephts* of the War of
Independence placed their arms, recalls the ancient girdle; 'gird
thyself' meant 'arm thyself' (Homer, Iliad)."

[57] : "The Albanian soldier who arrived in southern Italy during the
days of Scanderbeg wore a distinctive costume; if he was a "Gheg"
(northern Albanian), he wore rather tight breeches and a waistcoat; if
he was a "Tosk" (southern Albanian), he wore a "fustanella" (a white
pleated skirt) and a waistcoat."
