Grass skirts were introduced to Hawaii by immigrants from the [Gilbert
islands](Gilbert_islands "wikilink") around the 1870s to 1880s[1]
although their origins are also attributed to [Samoa](Samoa "wikilink")
as well.[2][3] According to DeSoto Brown, historian at the [Bishop
Museum](Bishop_Museum "wikilink") in Honolulu, it is likely Hawaiian
dancers began wearing them during their performances on the
[vaudeville](vaudeville "wikilink") circuit of the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") mainland. Traditional Hawaiian skirts
were often made with fresh [ti leaves](Cordyline_fruticosa "wikilink")
which were not available in the United States. By the turn of the
century Hawaiian dancers in both Hawaii and the U.S. were wearing grass
skirts. Even today some Hawaiian style hula dancers still wear them.[4]
The traditional costume of Hawaiian *[hula
kahiko](Hula#Hula_Kahiko "wikilink")* includes [kapa](kapa "wikilink")
cloth skirts and men in malo ([loincloth](loincloth "wikilink"))
however, during the 1880s *hula ‘auana* was developed from western
influences. It is during this period that the grass skirt began to be
seen everywhere although *hula ‘auana* costumes usually included more
western looking clothing with fabric-topped dresses for women and pants
for men.[5] The use of the grass skirt was present in the 1893 [World's
Columbian Exposition](World's_Columbian_Exposition "wikilink") in
Chicago where Hawaiian hula dancers played into American stereotypes by
wearing the costume.

From the late 19th-century and into [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink"), grass skirts in
[Polynesia](Polynesia "wikilink") became a "powerful symbol of South Sea
sexuality". In the [Pacific
theater](Pacific_Theater_(World_War_II) "wikilink"), grass skirts were
sought after souvenirs by servicemen abroad.[6] The end of the war saw
many sailors returning from their duties in the Pacific. Polynesian
culture had begun to take root in the US through such things as [James
A. Michener](James_A._Michener "wikilink")'s *[Tales of the South
Pacific](Tales_of_the_South_Pacific "wikilink")* and its subsequent
musical and film adaption, as well as [Don the
Beachcomber](Don_the_Beachcomber "wikilink") opening in Hollywood. The
war had helped to create a national interest in Polynesian food and
décor. The tiki culture continued, spurred on by
[Hawaii](Hawaii "wikilink")'s statehood in 1959 and Disney's opening of
the [Enchanted Tiki Room](Walt_Disney's_Enchanted_Tiki_Room "wikilink")
in 1963 as well as popular film and television shows like "[Hawaiian
Eye](Hawaiian_Eye "wikilink")" in 1959 and [Elvis
Presley](Elvis_Presley "wikilink")'s *[Blue
Hawaii](Blue_Hawaii "wikilink")* in 1961.

In [Fijian culture](Fijian_culture "wikilink"), both women and men
traditionally wore skirts called the made from
[hibiscus](hibiscus "wikilink") or root fibers and grass.[7][8] In
[Maori culture](Maori_culture "wikilink"), the traditional skirt-like
garment made up of numerous strands of prepared
[flax](phormium_tenax "wikilink") fibres, woven or plaited, is known as
a .[9] In [Nauru culture](Culture_of_Nauru "wikilink") the native dress
of both sexes consists of a , a bushy skirt composed of thin strips of
*[pandanus](pandanus "wikilink")* palm-leaf that can be both short,
knee- and foot-long.[10][11][12] In [Tonga](Tonga "wikilink"), the grass
skirt was known as a and was worn in dance performances.[13]
