**Handkerchief skirts** are skirts with asymmetric hems, created from
fabric panels of different lengths sewn together, to create a hem with
several corners that hang down as points. The hem resembles a
[handkerchief](handkerchief "wikilink") that is held by the centre so
that its corners hang down as points.

## History

Handkerchief hems have been used in women's tops and skirt hems for
centuries in many cultures, to add a flattering drape, especially over
the hips. They can be seen in women's clothing in art from Ancient
Greece, and appeared in Parisian fashions in the 1910s-1920s, such as
the dresses of designer [Madeleine
Vionnet](Madeleine_Vionnet "wikilink").[1] [Jean
Patou](Jean_Patou "wikilink") followed Vionnet's lead, using the
handkerchief hem to transition hemlines away from the shorter
[Flapper](Flapper "wikilink") styles he had helped popularize, and
towards the longer lengths that were fashionable during the 1930s.[2]

In the simplest design, a square of fabric is cut with an opening in the
middle for the waistband. When the skirt is put on, the four corners
hang down as points. More panels of material can be used to increase the
number of corners, or points, along the hem.[3]

## Revival

In the first decade of the 21st century, handkerchief hems returned as a
trend in women's clothing. Since the design involves pleats that drape,
the effect is achieved with lightweight, flowing fabrics. In 2003, the
trend was evident in [bohemian styles](bohemian_styles "wikilink") such
as designs by American clothing label [Free
People](Free_People "wikilink").[4] In 2004, handkerchief hems were
modelled at Milan fashion shows.[5]
