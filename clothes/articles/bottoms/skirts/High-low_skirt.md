**High-low skirts**, also known as
[asymmetrical](asymmetrical "wikilink"),
[waterfall](waterfall "wikilink"), or mullet skirts, are skirts with a
hem that is higher in the front, or side, than in the back.

## History

![](Hi_lo_skirt.jpg "Hi_lo_skirt.jpg")

The high-low skirt has a full circle hem. However, the length varies
from short in front to long in back. The style originates in [Victorian
era](Victorian_era "wikilink") dresses and formal gowns, when the hem
style became known as the "[fishtail](fishtail_skirt "wikilink")".
During the 19th century, it became a trend in the mid-1870s, reappearing
in the early 1880s,[1] and later in women's formal gowns and evening
dresses throughout the 20th century, particularly in the late 1920s and
early 1930s, where lowering hemlines were a mask that would start off
1930s silhouettes.

The recent high-low skirt hem trend began in late 2011. The high-low
skirt became a trend in Europe and America in late 2011, eventually
becoming a worldwide fashion in Spring and Summer 2012. It has received
fashion press coverage in India, such as in the fashion labels [Namrata
Joshipura](Namrata_Joshipura "wikilink") and [Myoho](Myoho "wikilink"),
being praised for its "playfulness".[2] It received widespread
visibility outside of fashion circles after [The
Voice](The_Voice_(U.S.) "wikilink") contestant [Devyn
DeLoera](Devyn_DeLoera "wikilink") wore a peach-coloured high-low skirt
for her audition in summer 2012.

The skirt style has been given a variety of names by designers and the
press, including asymmetrical and waterfall, with the most derisive term
being "mullet skirt", used by Britain's
[Mirror](Daily_Mirror "wikilink") newspaper in criticising a version
worn by singer [Cher Lloyd](Cher_Lloyd "wikilink") in April 2012,[3] a
mocking reference to the now unfashionable mullet hairstyle that was a
brief men's [fad](fad "wikilink") in the 1980s. However, some high-low
dress wearers have embraced the term, referring to their own dress as a
mullet dress.

## Asymmetric peplum trend

A related trend in 2011 and 2012 is the asymmetric
[peplum](overskirt "wikilink") hem on shirts, sweaters and jackets for
women. The peplum, a broad ruffled hem that is fitted at the waist and
flares outward, has been a recurring fashion trend in Europe for
centuries, and was last popular in Europe and North America during the
1940s and 1950s. An asymmetric version has been brought to women's
fashion in 2012, but not all consumers find it flattering, with one
American stating, "I do not believe it hides large hips and behinds, and
the new asymmetrical peplums should only be worn by the tall and
thin".[4]
