![](HobbleSkirtPostcard.jpg "fig:HobbleSkirtPostcard.jpg") A **hobble
skirt** was a [skirt](skirt "wikilink") with a narrow enough
[hem](hem "wikilink") to significantly impede the wearer's
[stride](Gait_(human) "wikilink"). It was called a "hobble skirt" for
that very reason; it seemed to hobble any woman as she tried to walk
around while wearing one. Hobble skirts were a short-lived fashion trend
that peaked between 1908 and 1914.[1]

The hobble skirt may have been inspired by one of the first women to fly
in an airplane.[2] At a 1908 Wright Brothers demonstration in Le Mans,
France, Mrs. (Edith) Hart O. Berg asked for a ride and became the first
American woman to fly as a passenger in an airplane, soaring for two
minutes and seven seconds.[3][4] She tied a rope securely around her
skirt at her ankles to keep it from blowing in the wind during the
flight. According to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, a French
fashion designer was inspired by the way Mrs. Berg walked away from the
aircraft with her skirt still tied and created the hobble skirt based on
her ingenuity.[5]

The French fashion designer in the Berg story might have been Paul
Poiret[6] who claimed credit for the hobble skirt, but it is not clear
whether the skirt was his invention or not.[7] Skirts had been rapidly
narrowing since the mid-1900s.[8] Slim skirts were economical because
they used less fabric.[9]

The hobble skirt became popular just as women were becoming more
physically active.[10]

Hobble skirts inspired hundreds of cartoons and comic postcards.[11] One
series of comic post cards called it the "speed-limit skirt."[12] There
were several reports of women competing in hobble skirt races as a
joke.[13]

Boarding a streetcar in a hobble skirt was particularly difficult. In
1912, the New York Street Railway began running hobble skirt cars with
no step up.[14] Los Angeles introduced similar streetcars in 1913.[15]

Hobble skirts were directly responsible for several deaths.[16] In 1910,
a hobble-skirt-wearing woman was killed by a loose horse at a racetrack
outside Paris.[17] A year later, eighteen-year-old Ida Goyette stumbled
on an Erie Canal bridge while wearing a hobble skirt, fell over the
railing, and drowned.[18]

To prevent women from splitting their skirts, some women wore a
[fetter](fetter "wikilink") or tied their legs together at the
knee.[19][20] Some designers made alterations to the hobble skirt to
allow for greater movement.[21] Jeanne Paquin concealed pleats in her
hobble skirts while other designers such as
[Lucile](Lucy,_Lady_Duff-Gordon "wikilink") offered slit or wrap
skirts.[22]

The hobble skirt trend began to decline in popularity at the beginning
of World War I, as the skirt's limited mobility did not suit the wartime
atmosphere.[23]
