A **hoop skirt** or **hoopskirt** is a women's
[undergarment](undergarment "wikilink") worn in various periods to hold
the [skirt](skirt "wikilink") extended into a fashionable shape. Its
Tudor name was a '[farthingale](farthingale "wikilink")'.

It originated as a modest-sized mechanism for holding long skirts away
from one's legs, to stay cooler in hot climates and to keep from
tripping on the skirt during various activities. Small hoops might be
worn by farmers and while working in the garden. Hoops were then adopted
as a fashion item, and the size and scale of the hoops grew in
grandeur.[1] Especially during the mid-nineteenth century, specifically
during the transition from the 1850's to the 1860's.[2] During this time
of a newfound society of consumerism, the roles of men and women changed
and so did their dress. [3] As male dress became tailored, the female
costume of the period made women practically immobilized due to the
cumbersome amount of petticoats needed to create the "full" look of the
era.[4] Thus when the circular crinoline came out in 1856 it was a
revelation not only of technology but of convenience for women.[5] By
the 1870's the cage of the crinoline became a cage only on the rear of
the woman's undergarments.[6] This is known today as a bustle.

Hoop skirts typically consist of a fabric
[petticoat](petticoat "wikilink") sewn with channels designed to act as
casings for stiffening materials, variously [rope](rope "wikilink"),
[osiers](willow "wikilink"), [whalebone](whalebone "wikilink"),
[steel](steel "wikilink"), or, from the mid-20th century,
[nylon](nylon "wikilink").[7][8]

Hoop skirts are called by various names in different periods:

-   [Farthingale](Farthingale "wikilink")
    ([Spanish](Spanish_(language) "wikilink") *verdugado*) (16th
    century)
-   [Panniers](Pannier_(clothing) "wikilink") or "side hoops" (18th
    century)
-   [Crinoline](Crinoline "wikilink") or crinolette (mid-19th century)

Lightweight hoop skirts, usually with nylon hoops, are worn today under
very full-skirted [wedding gowns](wedding_gown "wikilink"). They can
sometimes be seen in the [gothic fashion](gothic_fashion "wikilink")
scene. Reproduction hoop skirts are an essential part of [living
history](living_history "wikilink") costuming, including [American Civil
War reenactment](American_Civil_War_reenactment "wikilink").
