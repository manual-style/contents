![](Kanga.png "fig:Kanga.png") The **kanga**, is a colourful fabric
similar to [kitenge](kitenge "wikilink"), but lighter, worn by women and
occasionally by men throughout the [African Great
Lakes](African_Great_Lakes "wikilink") region. It is a piece of printed
[cotton](cotton "wikilink") [fabric](Textile "wikilink"), about 1.5 m by
1 m, often with a border along all four sides (called *pindo* in
Swahili), and a central part (*mji*) which differs in design from the
borders. They are sold in pairs, which can then be cut and hemmed to be
used as a set.

Whereas [kitenge](kitenge "wikilink") is a more formal fabric used for
nice clothing, the kanga is much more than a clothing piece, it can be
used as a skirt, head-wrap, apron, pot-holder, towel, and much more. The
kanga is culturally significant on Eastern coast of Africa, often given
as a gift for birthdays or other special occasions.[1] They are also
given to mourning families in Tanzania after the loss of a family member
as part of a michengo (or collection) into which many community members
put a bit of money to support the family in their grief. Kangas are also
similar to Kishutu and [Kikoy](Kikoy "wikilink") which are traditionally
worn by men. The Kishutu is one of the earliest known designs, probably
named after a town in Tanzania, they are particular given to young
brides as part of their dowry or by healers to cast off evil spirits.
Due to its ritual function they do not always include a proverb.[2]

The earliest pattern of the kanga was patterned with small dots or
speckles, which look like the plumage of the guinea hen, also called
"kanga" in Swahili. This is where the name comes from, contrary to the
belief that it comes from a Swahili verb for to close.

## Origins

![](KangaSiyu1.jpg "fig:KangaSiyu1.jpg") on [Pate
Island](Pate_Island "wikilink"), [Kenya](Kenya "wikilink").\]\] Kangas
have been a traditional type of dress amongst women in [East
Africa](East_Africa "wikilink") since the 19th century.[3]

### Merikani

According to some sources, it was developed from a type of unbleached
cotton cloth imported from the US. The cloth was known as *merikani* in
Zanzibar, a Swahili [noun](noun "wikilink") derived from the
[adjective](adjective "wikilink") *American* (indicative of the place it
originated). Male slaves wrapped it around their waist and female slaves
wrapped it under their armpits.[4] To make the cloth more feminine,
slave women occasionally dyed them black or dark blue, using locally
obtained indigo. This dyed merikani was referred to as kaniki.[5] People
despised kaniki due to its association with slavery. Ex-slave women
seeking to become part of the Swahili society began to decorate their
merikani clothes. They did this using one of three techniques; a form of
resist dying, a form of block printing or hand painting. After slavery
was abolished in 1897, Kangas began to be used for self-empowerment and
to indicate that the wearer had personal wealth.

### Lenços

According to other sources, the origin is in the kerchief squares called
*lencos* brought by Portuguese traders from India and Arabia. Stylish
ladies in [Zanzibar](Zanzibar "wikilink") and
[Mombasa](Mombasa "wikilink"), started to use them stitching together
six kerchiefs in a 3X2 pattern to create one large rectangular wrap.
Soon they became popular in the whole coastal region, later expanding
inland to the Great Lakes region. They are still known as *lesos* or
*lessos* in some localities, after the Portuguese word.

### Manufacture

Until the mid-twentieth century, they were mostly designed and printed
in India, the Far East and Europe. Since the 1950s kangas started to be
printed also in the city of Morogoro in Tanzania (MeTL Group Textile
Company) and Kenya (Rivatex and Thika Cloth Mills Ltd are some of the
largest manufacturers in Kenya) and other countries on the African
continent.[6]

### Proverbs

In the early 1900s, proverbs, sayings, aphorisms and slogans were added
to kangas. A trader in Mombasa, Kaderdina Hajee Essak, also known as
"Abdulla", began to distinguish his kangas with the mark "K.H.E. - Mali
ya Abdulla",[7] to which he often added a proverb in Swahili. Initially
they were printed in [Arabic script](Arabic_script "wikilink"), and
later in [Roman letters](Latin_script "wikilink").[8] Towards the
eastern part of the region, phrases in
[Kiswahili](Swahili_language "wikilink") are traditional, while in
central areas phrases in both Kiswahili and
[Lingala](Lingala "wikilink") are popular.

## Appearance

-   Generally Kangas are 150 cm wide by 110 cm long.
-   They are rectangular and always have a border along all four sides.
-   Often kangas have a central symbol.
-   Most modern kangas bear a saying, usually in Kiswahili.

There are many different ways to wear kangas. One traditional way of
wearing the kanga is to wrap one piece as a shawl, to cover the head and
shoulders, and another piece wrapped around the waist. Kangas are also
used as baby carriers.[9]

Typically, kangas consist of three parts: The *pindo* (wide border), the
*mji* (central motif), *Ujumbe* or *jina* (the Kiswahili) is featured on
a strip which contains a message. It is less commonly written in
[Arabic](Arabic_language "wikilink") or
[Comorian](Comorian_language "wikilink"). Other countries which produce
their own Kangas write the Kanga messages/names in their main languages:
in [Madagascar](Madagascar "wikilink") (Malagasy Republic) where they
are known as [lambas](Lamba_(garment) "wikilink"), they feature
[ohabolana](ohabolana "wikilink"), traditional proverbs written in
[Malagasy](Malagasy_language "wikilink"); they are also produced in
[Zambia](Zambia "wikilink") and [Malawi](Malawi "wikilink"). This
message is called the *jina* (literally 'name') of the kanga. Messages
are often in the form of riddles or proverbs. When giving a kanga as a
gift, one must be mindful of the proverb, as they can be somewhat
insulting. Occasionally, one of these is given as a gift at a wedding to
express a person's opinion that the couple shouldn't be married!
However, most of the messages express kind sentiments and good wishes.
Some examples of proverbs:

-   *Majivuno hayafai*: There is no value in showing off[10]
-   *Mkipendana mambo huwa sawa*: Everything is all right if you love
    each other[11]
-   *Japo sipati tamaa sikati*: Even though I have nothing, I have not
    given up my desire to get what I want[12]
-   *Wazazi ni dhahabu kuwatunza ni thawabu*: Parents are gold; to take
    care of them is a blessing[13]
-   *Sisi sote abiria dereva ni Mungu*: We are all passengers, God is
    the driver[14]
-   *Fimbo La Mnyonge Halina Nguvu*: The feeble punishers blow, is
    weak.[15]
-   *Mwanamke mazingira tunataka, usawa, amani, maendelo*: We (women)
    want equality, peace, and progress[16]
-   *Naogopa simba na meno yake siogopi mtu kwa maneno yake*: I’m afraid
    of a lion with its strong teeth but not a man with his
    words[17](lyrics).
-   *Leo ni siku ya shangwe na vigelegele*: Today is a day for
    celebrations and ululations.
