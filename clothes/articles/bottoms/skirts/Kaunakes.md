A ***kaunakes***[1] ( or ; )[2][3] or***persis*** was a
[woolen](wool "wikilink") [mantle](mantle_(clothing) "wikilink")
associated with [ancient](Ancient_Near_East "wikilink")
[Mesopotamia](Mesopotamia "wikilink") and
[Persia](Ancient_Persia "wikilink"). It was woven in a tufted pattern
suggesting overlapping petals or feathers, either by sewing tufts onto
the garment or by weaving loops into the fabric.

## Background

The origin of this dress is traced to the [Sumerian
civilization](Sumer "wikilink") which existed even before 4,000 BC. The
[Early Dynastic Period](Early_Dynastic_Period_(Mesopotamia) "wikilink")
between 2,700 and 2,350 BC was marked by high culture. The dress was a
[unisex](unisex "wikilink") garment which both men and women wore. The
skirt was made from [sheepskin](sheepskin "wikilink") and was worn with
the skin turned inside and with tufts ornamented like a toothed-comb
over the wool. It was used in the form of a [wraparound
skirt](wrapper_(clothing) "wikilink") tied and worn from the waist
extending to the knees.[4] Servants and soldiers wore the shortest
garments, while persons of high status wore longer ones with the skirt
often extending down to the ankles. The upper part of the body was
either covered with another sheepskin [cloak](cloak "wikilink") spread
across the shoulders, or left bare. It was only around 2,500 BC that the
sheepskin garment was replaced by a textile made of woven wool; however
the tuft part of the dress was continued in the form of "sewing tufts
onto the garment or by weaving loops into the fabric". The
[Greek](Greek_language "wikilink") called this dress kaunakes. This type
of dress is featured in sculptures and mosaics of this period.

## History

![](Relief_Ur-Nanshe_Louvre_AO2344.jpg "fig:Relief_Ur-Nanshe_Louvre_AO2344.jpg"),
king of [Lagash](Lagash "wikilink"), Early Dynastic III (2550–2500 BC),
with all figures wearing *kaunakes*\]\] In a Sumerian image dated
between 2,900 and 2,600 BC, the dress was worn as a
[pagne](pagne "wikilink"), which was a simple fleece pelt used as body
wrap but retaining the tail part. In some images the wraparound covered
the body crossed over the left shoulder. Following the discovery of
weaving, kaunakes were designed with tufts of wool stitched into the
cloth to "simulate the curling fleece fur".[5] It was a rustic fabric
made of [sheepskin](sheepskin "wikilink"), camel or goat's hide
fashioned in the form of a [shawl](shawl "wikilink") or skirts called
the "thick blanket" that evolved to suit the severe weather conditions
of the [Sumerian and Akkadian Mesopotamian
region](Sumero-Akkadian "wikilink").[6]

It is also believed that kaunakes, as a fashioned fleece, while not
mentioned prior to 300 BC could be traced to the 400–300 BC. During the
Greek period of [Aristophanes](Aristophanes "wikilink") the garment was
made from goat’s hair or wool in the style of a weighty
[mantle](Mantle_(vesture) "wikilink") or [cape](cape "wikilink"). Coptic
[Egypt](Egypt "wikilink"), not [Mesopotamia](Mesopotamia "wikilink"), is
credited with the original design of woven tapestry with projecting long
locks or strands of wool. Its manufacture evolved into kaunakes when the
woven fringe design began to mirror the original fleece and fur and was
shaped as a [mantle](Mantle_(vesture) "wikilink"). These were worn
during the winter season as a shawl over the shoulders, and during
summer adapted as a skirt. Over the centuries many designs evolved with
sleeves, then variants were made with cloth instead of fleece, and
eventually, it evolved back to a [cape](cape "wikilink") sans sleeves.

on display in the [Louvre](Louvre "wikilink")\]\] In
[Athens](Athens "wikilink"), initially the dress was thought to be of
[Persian](Persia "wikilink") origin but later it came to be identified
as a [Babylonian](Babylonia "wikilink") garment, as it matched with the
textile practices of the northeast from
[Mesopotamia](Mesopotamia "wikilink"). Part of the confusion arose from
the naming of the garment, because the root word is linguistically
closer to [Iranian language](Iranian_language "wikilink"), rather than
[Babylonian language](Akkadian_language "wikilink"). The dress was also
used by a stage actor in a drama scene of
[Aristophanes](Aristophanes "wikilink")' *Wasps* in
[Athens](Athens "wikilink"), as the design of the exotic dress suited
the dramatic effect in view of it being "visually distinctive", heavy
and with small decorative tufts. It was the Athenians' belief that the
kaunakes was of Persian origin and not from Babylon from an
understanding that the dress was an exported item and could have
originated from [Anatolia](Anatolia "wikilink")
([Kilikia](Kilikia "wikilink") or [Phrygia](Phrygia "wikilink")), the
[Levant](Levant "wikilink") ([Phoenicia](Phoenicia "wikilink") or
[Syria](Syria "wikilink")), or Mesopotamia (Babylon), which were all
part of the [Persian Empire](Persian_Empire "wikilink") in the fifth
century BC.

## Purpose

An image dated to about 3rd millennium BC from the [Temple of
Ishtar](Temple_of_Ishtar "wikilink") at [Mari](Mari,_Syria "wikilink"),
[Tell Hariri](Tell_Hariri "wikilink"), in [Syria](Syria "wikilink")
shows kaunakes wrapped as a cloak around the shoulders of an
[alabaster](alabaster "wikilink") image of a woman in a seated posture;
the kaunakes is inferred as made from goat hair or wool.[7] From 2,450
BC it was a royal dress, as seen from the figures in prayer mode in
Mesopotamia. In this, the dress was formed with woolly tufts laid
successively in horizontal lines and suspended vertically. It was
fashioned generally as a woman's dress, adorning the left arm and
shoulder with the right side exposing the skin and the breast.[8]
