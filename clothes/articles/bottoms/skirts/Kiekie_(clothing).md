![](Kiekie_yams.jpg "fig:Kiekie_yams.jpg") A **kiekie** is a
[Tongan](Tonga "wikilink") dress, an ornamental girdle around the waist,
mainly worn by women on semiformal occasions, but nowadays also
sometimes by men. At highly formal occasions both gender will settle for
a [taovala](ta'ovala "wikilink"). At casual occasions no girdle is
needed for any gender, although women may continue wearing a kiekie even
then, as it is considered an easy sitting, nice looking decoration, with
which one can show off. (All taovala look more or less the same, and are
usually quite stiff and hot to wear).

The characteristic of a kiekie is that it is between a mat and a grass
skirt *(manafau)*: it is a string skirt attached to a waistband. It is
supposed to be somewhat transparent, showing the
[skirt](skirt "wikilink") or [tupenu](tupenu "wikilink") worn under it.
The strings can be short as a mini skirt, or down to the ankles, but
down to somewhat above the knees is most common.

Related to the kiekie is the *sisi*, where the strings are
[sī](ti_(plant) "wikilink") leaves or plaited *maile* leaves, but where
the waistband, full with sweet smelling flowers and fruits, is more
important. Sisi are worn by both gender during dance performances.

Kiekie are part of the [koloa](koloa "wikilink"), the handicraft goods
made by the women. Every woman can do it, although nowadays we see that
some women specialise in it and sell their products on the market.

Kiekie can be made from many different materials, both natural and
introduced:

-   strips of [pandanus](pandanus "wikilink") leaves, often painted in
    bright colours. Either hanging loose, or plaited together. The
    *salusalu* is a long kiekie, especially for
    [Haapai](Ha'apai "wikilink").
-   strips of [hibiscus](hibiscus "wikilink") bast fiber, called *fau*.
    Same as the pandanus leaves, but not as coarse and therefore suited
    for finer designs.
-   *kaka*, de fibrous tissue which is wrapped around the growing fronds
    of [palm](Arecaceae "wikilink") trees. It is usually varnished to
    make it stronger and then cut in all type of shapes.
-   strings or ropes
-   little disks (few centimeter diameter) made from coconut shell and
    strung together along their diameter.
-   [New Zealand flax](New_Zealand_flax "wikilink"), a
    [Māori](Māori_people "wikilink") [piupiu](piupiu "wikilink") (see
    [Pania](Pania "wikilink")).
