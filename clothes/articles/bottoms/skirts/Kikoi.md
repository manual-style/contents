A **kikoi** is a traditional rectangle of woven cloth originating from
[Africa](Africa "wikilink"), particularly along the east coast as far
south as the [Horn of Africa](Horn_of_Africa "wikilink"). It is most
commonly viewed a type of [sarong](sarong "wikilink"). As with all
sarongs it is a single piece of cloth which is wrapped around the waist,
and rolled over outwards a couple of times. However, to the people
native to that part of Africa, they are much more versatile and
ubiquitous. They can be used as a sling to hold a baby, towel, [head
wrap](head_wrap "wikilink"), etc.
