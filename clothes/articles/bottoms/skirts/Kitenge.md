**Kitenge** or **chitenge** is an [East
African](East_Africa "wikilink"), West African and Central African
fabric similar to [sarong](sarong "wikilink"), often worn by women and
wrapped around the chest or waist, over the head as a
[headscarf](headscarf "wikilink"), or as a [baby
sling](baby_sling "wikilink"). Kitenges are colourful pieces of fabric.
In the Coastal area of Kenya, and in Tanzania, Kitenges often have
Swahili sayings written on them.

Kitenges are similar to [kangas](Kanga_(African_garment) "wikilink") and
kikoy, but are of a thicker cloth and have an edging on only a long
side. [Kenya](Kenya "wikilink"), [Uganda](Uganda "wikilink"),
[Tanzania](Tanzania "wikilink"), [Sudan](Sudan "wikilink"),
[Nigeria](Nigeria "wikilink"), [Ghana](Ghana "wikilink"),
[Senegal](Senegal "wikilink"), [Liberia](Liberia "wikilink"),
[Rwanda](Rwanda "wikilink"), and [Democratic Republic of the
Congo](Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo "wikilink") are some of the
African countries where kitenge is worn. In [Malawi](Malawi "wikilink"),
[Namibia](Namibia "wikilink") and [Zambia](Zambia "wikilink"), kitenge
is known as *Chitenge*. They are sometimes worn by men around the waist
in hot weather. In some countries like Malawi, Chitenges never used to
be worn by men until recently when the president encouraged civil
servants to buy Malawian products by wearing Chitenge on Fridays.

Kitenges (plural *vitenge* in [Swahili](Swahili_language "wikilink");
*zitenge* in [Tonga](Tonga_people_of_Zambia_and_Zimbabwe "wikilink"))
serve as an inexpensive, informal piece of clothing that is often
decorated with a huge variety of colors, patterns and even political
[slogans](slogan "wikilink").

The printing on the cloth is done by a traditional
[batik](batik "wikilink") technique. These are known as wax prints and
the design is equally as bright and detailed on the obverse side of the
fabric. These days Wax prints are commercially made and are almost
completely roller printed. Fancy prints are roller printed with the
designs being less colorful or detailed on the obverse side. Many of the
designs have a meaning. A large variety of religious and political
designs are found as well as traditional tribal patterns. The cloth is
used as material for dresses, blouses and pants as well.

## Uses

Chitenges can be used on occasions and in many ways either symbolically
or for practical reasons. Chitenges are used in different settings to
convey messages. The following list demonstrates uses of the cloths.

-   In Malawi, Chitenjes are customary for women at funerals.
-   They are used as a sling to hold a baby across the back of a mother.
    They can hold the baby at the front as well, particularly when
    breast feeding.
-   Chitenges are given as gifts to young women.
-   They are sometimes tied together and used as decorative pieces at
    dinner tables.
-   When women go to the beach, often the Chitenge is wrapped around the
    bathing suit for modesty or to shield cold air.
-   Chitenges can be framed or otherwise hung up on the wall as a
    decorative batik artwork.

Kitenges have also become very popular as fashion statements in urban
pop culture with youth in Africa. Kitenges are incorporated in clothing
items such as hoodies, trousers, and accessories such as bags.
