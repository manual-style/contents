**krama** ( ) is a sturdy traditional [Cambodian
garment](Cambodian_clothing "wikilink") with many uses, including as a
[scarf](scarf "wikilink"), [bandanna](Kerchief "wikilink"), to cover the
face, for decorative purposes, and as a hammock for children.[1] It may
also be used as a form of weaponry. [Bokator](Bokator "wikilink")
fighters wrap the krama around their waists, heads and fists. The skill
level of the martial artist is signified by the colour of the krama,
white being the lowest and black being the most advanced.[2] It is worn
by men, women and children, and can be fairly ornate, though most
typical kramas contain a [gingham](gingham "wikilink") pattern of some
sort, and traditionally come in either red or blue. It is the Cambodian
national symbol.

A closely related Thai garment is known as *pha khao ma* (ผ้าขาวม้า) and
is worn in the [Isan](Isan "wikilink") region by locals and by [ethnic
Khmers](Khmer_Surin "wikilink").[3]
