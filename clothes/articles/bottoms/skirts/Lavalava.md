**lavalava**, also known as an ***'ie***, short for 'ie lavalava, is an
article of daily clothing traditionally worn by
[Polynesians](Polynesia "wikilink") and other
[Oceanic](Oceania "wikilink") peoples. It consists of a single
rectangular cloth worn as a [skirt](skirt "wikilink").[1] The term
*lavalava* is both singular and plural in the [Samoan
language](Samoan_language "wikilink").

## Customary use

Today the fashion remains common in [Samoa](Samoa "wikilink"), [American
Samoa](American_Samoa "wikilink"), [Tonga](Tonga "wikilink") and parts
of [Melanesia](Melanesia "wikilink") and
[Micronesia](Micronesia "wikilink"). It is worn by men and women in uses
from school uniforms to business attire with a suit jacket and tie. Many
people of Oceanic ethnicity wear the *lavalava* as an expression of
cultural identity and for comfort within expatriate communities,
especially in the [United States](United_States "wikilink") (notably
[Hawaii](Hawaii "wikilink"), [Alaska](Alaska "wikilink"),
[California](California "wikilink"),
[Washington](Washington_(U.S._state) "wikilink"), and
[Utah](Utah "wikilink")), [Australia](Australia "wikilink"), and [New
Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink").

## Attire

The *lavalava* is secured around the waist by an overhand knotting of
the upper corners of the cloth; women often tuck the loose ends into the
waistband, while men usually allow them to hang in front. Women
generally wear ankle-length *lavalava* while men's wraps often extend to
the knee or mid-calf depending on the activity or occasion.

## History

Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the Pacific Ocean, the most
prestigious *lavalava* were made by wrapping the body in a *['ie
toga]('ie_toga "wikilink")* with fine mats (finely woven textiles of
[pandanus](pandanus "wikilink") leaves) or *siapo* ([tapa
cloth](tapa_cloth "wikilink")) pounded from [paper
mulberry](paper_mulberry "wikilink") or wild
[hibiscus](hibiscus "wikilink") bark. The Samoans also created
*lavalava* from traditional materials such as flower petals, leaves,
feathers and seashells tied to a wrap-around backing of plaited plant
fibers.

[Calico](Calico_(textile) "wikilink") and loomed
[cotton](cotton "wikilink") cloth had largely replaced woven or
barkcloth *lavalava* as articles of daily use (though *‘ie toga* and
*siapo* wraps are still used today for ceremonial and festive occasions
and dance performances). Samoan men who bear the
*[pe'a](pe'a "wikilink")* body tattoo, as well as Samoan women who bear
the *[malu](malu "wikilink")* leg tattoos often roll the waistband of
the *lavalava* or tuck in the sides and rear portion(s) of the
*lavalava* to expose their tattoo during dance performances or
ceremonial functions (such as 'ava ceremonies), a style referred to as
*agini*.

## Current forms

Specially tailored linen *lavalava* which extend mid-calf, often with
pockets and ties/buckles, are worn by men at special occasions or to
church; these are always solid colors (in contrast to the bright
patterns of everyday *lava-lava*) and are known as *sulu*
([Fijian](Fijian_language "wikilink")), *'ie faitaga* (Samoan), or
*[tupenu](tupenu "wikilink")* ([Tongan](Tongan_language "wikilink")).
Similar ankle-length skirts form the lower half of the two-piece formal
dress worn by Samoan and Tongan women (called
*[puletasi](puletasi "wikilink")* and *puletaha*, respectively). On
special occasions the Tongan *tupenu* and *puletaha* are usually
associated with a tapa cloth or waist-mat called
*[ta'ovala](ta'ovala "wikilink")* and some Samoans still wear a tapa
cloth *vala* sash in similar fashion (though the *vala* is generally
restricted to ceremonial/festive regalia of orators or people
acting/dressing as *taupou* maidens and *manaia* beaus). The formal,
tailored linen *lavalava* styles of Tonga, Samoa, and Fiji originated
with the Fijian noble Ratu Sir [Lala Sukuna](Lala_Sukuna "wikilink") who
introduced the buckled *sulu* to Fiji in 1920 following his military
service and university education in Europe.

Loudly colored *lavalava* made from materials such as
[satin](satin "wikilink"), [velvet](velvet "wikilink"),
[polyester](polyester "wikilink"), and [sequins](sequins "wikilink")
have recently been popularized among performance dance groups and
village, church, or school-based choirs.

## Related names and garments

In English, such garments are generically called
[sarong](sarong "wikilink"), but that word is actually
[Malay](Malay_language "wikilink"), whereas *lavalava* is Samoan, being
short for *ʻie lavalava* (cloth that wraps around). Another common name
for the Polynesian variety is *pāreu* (usually spelled
*[pareo](pareo "wikilink")*), which is the
[Tahitian](Tahitian_language "wikilink") name.[2] In [New
Caledonia](New_Caledonia "wikilink") and [Wallis and
Futuna](Wallis_and_Futuna "wikilink"), lavalava are called "*manou*". A
similar simple kind of clothing is the *[lap-lap](lap-lap "wikilink")*
worn in [Papua New Guinea](Papua_New_Guinea "wikilink") and the [South
Pacific](Oceania "wikilink"), which is completely open at both sides.
