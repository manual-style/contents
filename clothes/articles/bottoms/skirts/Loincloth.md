**loincloth** is a one-piece garment, sometimes kept in place by a
[belt](Belt_(clothing) "wikilink"). It covers the
[genitals](genitals "wikilink") and, at least partially, the
[buttocks](buttocks "wikilink").

## History and types

Loincloths are being worn, and have been worn, in societies where no
other clothing is needed or wanted. Loincloths are commonly used as an
[undergarment](undergarment "wikilink") or
[swimsuit](swimsuit "wikilink"), by [wrestlers](wrestlers "wikilink")
and by farmers in [paddy fields](paddy_field "wikilink") in both [Sri
Lanka](Sri_Lanka "wikilink") and [India](India "wikilink"), where it is
called *Amudaya* in Sinhala and [kaupinam](kaupinam "wikilink") or
[Kov(m)anam](Kov(m)anam "wikilink") or langot.

The loincloth, or breechcloth, is a basic form of dress, often worn as
the only garment. Men have worn a loincloth as a fundamental piece of
clothing which covers their genitals, not the buttocks, in most
societies which disapproved of genital nakedness throughout human
history. The loincloth is in essence a piece of material,
bark-[bast](bast_fibre "wikilink"), [leather](leather "wikilink"), or
cloth, passed between the legs and covering the genitals. Despite its
functional simplicity, the loincloth comes in many different forms.

without other garments\]\]

A breechcloth, or breechclout, consists of a strip of material (bark,
cloth, leather) passed between the thighs and secured by a belt. A
loincloth is a long piece of cloth, passed between the thighs and wound
around the waist.

Breechcloths and loincloths are garments of dignity among those who
traditionally wear them. The styles in which breechcloths and loincloths
can be arranged are myriad. Both the [Bornean](Borneo "wikilink")
*sirat* and the Indian *[dhoti](dhoti "wikilink")* have fabric pass
between the legs to support a man's genitals.

A similar style of loincloth was also characteristic of ancient
[Mesoamerica](Mesoamerica "wikilink"). The male inhabitants of the area
of modern [Mexico](Mexico "wikilink") wore a wound loincloth of woven
fabric. One end of the loincloth was held up, the remainder passed
between the thighs, wound about the waist, and secured in back by
tucking.[1]

festival\]\]

In Pre-Columbian [South America](South_America "wikilink"), ancient
[Inca](Andean_civilizations "wikilink") men wore a strip of cloth
between their legs held up by strings or tape as a belt. The cloth was
secured to the tapes at the back and the front portion hung in front as
an apron, always well ornamented. The same garment, mostly in plain
[cotton](cotton "wikilink") but whose aprons are now, like T-shirts,
sometimes decorated with logos, is known in Japan as *etchu
[fundoshi](fundoshi "wikilink")*.

Some of the culturally diverse [Amazonian
indigenous](Indigenous_peoples_in_Brazil "wikilink") still wear an
ancestral type of loincloth.

Japanese men wore until recently a loincloth known as a
*[fundoshi](fundoshi "wikilink")*. The *fundoshi* is a 35 cm (14 in.)
wide piece of fabric (cotton or [silk](silk "wikilink")) passed between
the thighs and secured to cover the genitals.

## Breechcloth

![](Native_Cheyenne_Loincloth.jpg "fig:Native_Cheyenne_Loincloth.jpg") A
**breechcloth**, or **breechclout**, is a form of loincloth consisting
in a strip of material – usually a narrow
[rectangle](rectangle "wikilink") – passed between the thighs and held
up in front and behind by a belt or string.[2][3] Often, the flaps hang
down in front and back.[4]

### India

Unsewn [Kaupinam](Kaupinam "wikilink") and its later-era sewn variation
[langot](langot "wikilink") are [traditional clothes in
India](Clothing_in_India "wikilink"), worn as
[underwear](underwear "wikilink") in [dangal](Akhara#Dangal "wikilink")
held in [akharas](akhara "wikilink") especially
[wrestling](Wrestling_in_India "wikilink"), to prevent
[hernias](hernias "wikilink") and [hydrocele](hydrocele "wikilink").[5]
[Kacchera](Kacchera "wikilink") is mandatory for
[Sikhs](Sikhs "wikilink") to wear.

### Native Americans

men in breechcloths\]\] In most [Native
American](Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "wikilink") tribes, men
used to wear some form of breechcloth, often with
[leggings](leggings "wikilink").[6][7][8][9] The style differed from
tribe to tribe. In many tribes, the flaps hung down in front and back;
in others, the breechcloth looped outside the belt and was tucked into
the inside, for a more fitted look.[10] Sometimes, the breechcloth was
much shorter and a decorated apron panel was attached in front and
behind.[11]

A Native American woman or [teenage](adolescence "wikilink")
[girl](girl "wikilink") might also wear a fitted breechcloth underneath
her skirt, but not as outerwear. However, in many tribes young girls did
wear breechcloths like the [boys](boy "wikilink") until they became old
enough for skirts and dresses.[12] Among the [Mohave
people](Mohave_people "wikilink") of the American Southwest, a
breechcloth given to a young female symbolically recognizes her status
as [*hwame*](Two-Spirit "wikilink").[13]

### Europeans

Some [European](Ethnic_groups_in_Europe "wikilink") men around 2000 BC
wore [leather](leather "wikilink") breechcloths, as can be seen from the
clothing of [Ötzi](Ötzi "wikilink").[14][South Tyrol Museum of
Archaeology](http://www.iceman.it/en/clothing). Retrieved 2010-07-15.

[Ancient Romans](Ancient_Rome "wikilink") wore a type of loincloth known
as a [subligaculum](subligaculum "wikilink").

### Japanese

Japanese men traditionally wore a breechcloth known as a *fundoshi*. The
*fundoshi* is a 35 cm (14 in.) wide piece of fabric (cotton or
[silk](silk "wikilink")) passed between the thighs and secured to cover
the genitals. There are many ways of tying the *fundoshi*.[15]
