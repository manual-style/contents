![](LungiBoypagne.jpg "fig:LungiBoypagne.jpg"),
[Bangladesh](Bangladesh "wikilink") wearing a lungi with simple twist
knot.\]\] The **lungi** () is a type of [sarong](sarong "wikilink"),
originating from the [Indian
subcontinent](Indian_subcontinent "wikilink"),[1] and a traditional
[skirt](skirt "wikilink")-like [garment](garment "wikilink") worn around
the waist in [Sri Lanka](Sri_Lanka "wikilink"),
[India](India "wikilink"), [Bangladesh](Bangladesh "wikilink"),
[Pakistan](Pakistan "wikilink"), [Nepal](Nepal "wikilink"),
[Cambodia](Cambodia "wikilink"), [Myanmar](Myanmar "wikilink") and
[Thailand](Thailand "wikilink"). It is particularly popular in regions
where the heat and humidity create an unpleasant climate for trousers.

## Design

They are especially worn in hot regions. There are also cheaper "open"
lungis, in identical dimensions but not sewn into a tube shape. The
standard adult lungi is 115 cm in height and 200 cm in length, when
open. Children's lungis are available in approximately 2/3 of this size.
They are normally woven from [cotton](cotton "wikilink") and come in a
variety of designs and colors. Silk lungis are available for ceremonial
purposes such as weddings. The most common styles are either
solid-colored or [plaid](Tartan "wikilink"), reflecting the relative
ease and cost-effectiveness of producing these patterns on a power loom.
Blue is particularly popular, since it fades to pleasant tones in
contrast to other colors. Regardless of the design or color, lungis are
often lined at the top and bottom with a black/white stripe containing
reinforced weaving to prevent fraying.

## Usage

![](Lungi1.jpg "fig:Lungi1.jpg")
![](LungiBorder.jpg "fig:LungiBorder.jpg") Depending on local tradition,
lungis can be worn by men and/or women (rarely). They are tied or
fastened in various ways, and can be used in different cultural
activities, ranging from normal daily life to elaborate wedding
ceremonies. For daily purposes, a simple "double twist" knot is most
popular, where two points in the upper edge of lungi are brought
together and twisted around twice, with the ends tucked in at the waist.
However, it is also common for wearers to simply tie a double "pretzel
knot" from 2 points on the upper border, which produces a more secure
knot. The lungi's length can also be adjusted, for example, by tucking
in the lungi at the waist to make it resemble a short skirt.

## Regional variations

### India

In India, the customs behind wearing lungis vary by state. It could be
worn with or without the traditional unsewn
[kaupinam](kaupinam "wikilink") or later-era sewn
[langot](langot "wikilink"), both of which are type of traditional
[loincloth](loincloth "wikilink") undergarments.

In [Kerala](Kerala "wikilink"), the lungi is generally colourful and
available in various designs, and it is worn by both men and women. It
is also called Kaili. Physical laborers typically use it as a working
dress. A Kerala dhoti is plain white and known as
[mundu](mundu "wikilink"), and it often bears golden embroidery (known
as "kasavu" mundu), especially at the border; it is worn as formal
attire and on ceremonial occasions like weddings, festivals, etc.
Saffron-coloured mundus are known as *kaavi munde*. The men sometimes
tuck up their *mundus* (Kerala dhoti) or lungis with the bottom of the
garment being pulled up and tied back on to the waist. This would mean
that the mundu (Kerala dhoti) or lungi only covers the body from the
waist to the knees.

In [Andhra Pradesh](Andhra_Pradesh "wikilink"),
[Telangana](Telangana "wikilink") and [Tamil
Nadu](Tamil_Nadu "wikilink"), only men wear this garment, and it is worn
slightly differently from men in Kerala; Keralites tie the mundu to the
right side, while the Tamilians tie it to their left. However, there are
exceptions and some of the Muslim communities in Kerala also tie the
mundu to their left. It is also known as "Kaili" or "Saaram/Chaaram" in
South Tamil Nadu.

In [Tamil Nadu](Tamil_Nadu "wikilink") Lungi is considered as a
traditional informal or casual wear and also preferred as a comfortable
night wear. Lungis with checked pattern are more popular. White colour
lungi like drape is called as vesti([Dhoti](Dhoti "wikilink")) and is
used in formal occasions.

In [Karnataka](Karnataka "wikilink") it is customary for village
residents to wear the lungi at all times and for all occasions. The
garment is always worn for marriages; the bride and groom fathers and
the groom himself wear white *panche*. If a family can afford it, they
typically choose a pure silk *panche* for the marriage ceremony.

It is common in Konkan side of [Karnataka](Karnataka "wikilink") state.
Mostly used by [Nawayath](Nawayath "wikilink") people who hails from

attire. It is as a mark of their tradition in
[Bhatkal](Bhatkal "wikilink"). Mostly you will find them sewn like
cylindrical shape. White lungi is common in them

In [Punjab](Punjab_region "wikilink") (both Pakistani and Indian
portions), lungis are worn by both men and women. The male lungi is also
called a tehmat,[2][3] while the female lungi is called a *laacha*. They
are part of traditional dance attire in
[Bhangra](Bhangra_(dance) "wikilink") dance groups, but are also popular
in rural areas as home wear. They are generally tied in a different way
than in other parts of India and are, as a rule, unstitched and very
colourful. Wearing the lungi has declined in the Punjab region in recent
years.[4]

In [Odisha](Odisha "wikilink"), and [West
Bengal](West_Bengal "wikilink") the lungi is primarily worn at home by
males of all classes of society. Hindu men generally avoid wearing
lungis on the street.

In Odisha, [Sambalpuri](Sambalpuri_clothing "wikilink") with the
Sambalpuri pattern and [mule](Spinning_mule "wikilink") based lungis
from [Khordha](Khordha_district "wikilink") are available in addition to
normal cotton fabric lungis.

holding up a colorful lungi.\]\] The lungi ( , ) is the most commonly
seen dress of Bangladeshi men, although it is not normally worn for
formal occasions. In Bangladesh, lungis are worn by men, almost
universally indoors and commonly outdoors as well. Elaborately designed
[tartan](tartan "wikilink") cotton, [batik](batik "wikilink"), or

and [Khulna](Khulna "wikilink"). Bangladeshi women do not traditionally
wear lungis, although non-Bengali tribal women do wear similar garments
in some parts of [southeastern
Bangladesh](Chittagong_division "wikilink").

In April 2013, the Baridhara Housing Society—a housing society in
Dhaka—banned lungi, and began refusing entry to those who wore them.
However, many opposed the ban, taking to social media sites such as
Facebook and Twitter to criticize the decision. A march took place on 13
April to oppose the ban.

Meanwhile, U.S Ambassador [Dan Mozena](Dan_Mozena "wikilink") has been
