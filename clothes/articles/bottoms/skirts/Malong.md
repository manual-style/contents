The **malong** is a traditional [Filipino](Filipino_people "wikilink")
"tube skirt" made of handwoven or machine-made multi-colored cotton
cloth, bearing a variety of geometric or [okir](okir "wikilink")
designs. The malong is directly akin to the [sarong](sarong "wikilink")
worn by peoples in other parts of [Maritime Southeast
Asia](Maritime_Southeast_Asia "wikilink")
([Malaysia](Malaysia "wikilink"), [Brunei](Brunei "wikilink"), [East
Timor](East_Timor "wikilink"), [Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink") and the
[Philippines](Philippines "wikilink")). The malong is traditionally used
as a garment by numerous tribes in the [Southern
Philippines](Southern_Philippines "wikilink") and the [Sulu
Archipelago](Sulu_Archipelago "wikilink") and was historically worn
throughout the archipelago by lowland maritime groups.

Handwoven malongs are made by [Maranao](Maranao "wikilink"),
[Maguindanao](Maguindanao "wikilink"), and [T'boli](T'boli "wikilink")
weavers on a backstrap loom. The pattern or style of the malong may
indicate the weaver's tribal origin, such as the Maranao *malong
landap*. Very rare malong designs and styles can indicate the village in
which the malong was made, for example, the extremely intricate *malong
rawatan* made only by a handful of Maranao weavers in [Lanao del
Sur](Lanao_del_Sur "wikilink"), [Mindanao](Mindanao "wikilink").
Handwoven malongs, which are costly, are likely to be used only at
social functions, to display the social and economic status of the
wearer. While modern malongs are made of cotton and
[Lurex](Lurex_(yarn) "wikilink") threads, some contemporary handwoven
malongs are made of inexpensive rayon thread, to reduce the
manufacturing cost to the weaver and ultimate cost to the consumer.
There are many grades of cotton thread, and the cost of a malong can
also be reduced by using the lesser grades of cotton thread, or by
creating a loose or coarse weave.

Machine-made printed cotton malongs are made in Indonesia specifically
for export to the Philippines, and are commonly referred to as "batik"
because the item is imported; those inexpensive machine-made malongs are
used for everyday purposes. The designs of traditional handwoven designs
are used in imported cotton from Thailand, allowing the purchaser to
have a cotton machine-printed malong which, from a distance,
convincingly mimics the look of a much more expensive handwoven malong.

The malong can function as a skirt for both men and women, a
[turban](turban "wikilink"), [Niqab](Niqab "wikilink"),
[Hijab](Hijab "wikilink"), a dress, a blanket, a sunshade, a bedsheet, a
"dressing room", a hammock, a prayer mat, and other purposes. A newborn
is wrapped in a *malong,* and as he grows this piece of cloth becomes a
part of his daily life. When he dies, he is once again wrapped in a
*malong*. Among traditional tribal peoples, the malong is used in
everyday life. Even in areas where people wear Western-style clothing
during the day, the malong is commonly used as sleepwear. The malong is
also used in very big festivals, they wear this to show respect. Two are
represented in the Ayala Museum Collection: The "malong a andon" on the
left, and the "malong a landap" on the right. History has it that the
malong used to be worn throughout the archipelago by lowland maritime
groups. Handwoven malongs are made by Maranao, Maguindanao, and T'boli
weavers on a backstrap loom. The pattern or style of the malong may
indicate the weaver's tribal origin, such as the Maranao malong
“landap.” History has it that the malong used to be worn throughout the

Maranao, Maguindanao, and T’boli weavers on a backstrap loom.
