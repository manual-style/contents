The **mundu** (; pronounced ) is a garment worn around the waist in the
[Indian states](Indian_states "wikilink") of
[Kerala](Kerala "wikilink"), the [Tulu Nadu](Tulu_Nadu "wikilink")
region of [Karnataka](Karnataka "wikilink"), and the [Indian
Ocean](Indian_Ocean "wikilink") island nation of
[Maldives](Maldives "wikilink"). It is closely related to the
[dhoti](dhoti "wikilink"), [sarong](sarong "wikilink"), and
[lungi](lungi "wikilink"). In South Kanara, a district of Karnataka
state, the [Tulu](Tulu_language "wikilink") speaking folk and
[Beary](Beary "wikilink") community also wear the mundu. It is normally
woven in [cotton](cotton "wikilink") and coloured white or cream. The
colour is dependent on whether the cotton is bleached or unbleached. A
khaddar mundu is made using handlooms. When unbleached, the mundu is
called "*neriyathu*". In modern times, two types of mundu are
prevalent—the single and the double. A single mundu is draped once
around the waist, while the double is folded in half before draping. A
mundu is usually starched before use.

## Men

A mundu usually has a line of comparatively thicker cloth woven into it
near the border called the *kara*. The *kara* can be coloured and comes
in various sizes. There is also double coloured and ornamental *kara* (a
strip of colour at the end of the mundu). & Costumes Of Kerala. For more
ceremonial occasions (like weddings), a mundu has a golden embroidery
known as kasavu. The wearer highlights the 'kara' by carefully folding
the end of the mundu. The *kara* generally appears on the right-hand
side of the person, though styles with the kara on the left side are
prevalent. Unspoken rules of etiquette govern the way the mundu is worn.
Men will often fold the garment in half to resemble a short
[skirt](skirt "wikilink") when working, cycling, etc., but it is
considered disrespectful to speak to women or one's social superiors
with the mundu folded up this way, revealing the legs from the knee
down. When faced with such a social situation, the fold of the mundu is
loosened with an imperceptible flick and it flutters down to cover the
legs completely. Sometimes a belt will be used; a popular Velcro belt
that comes in either green or black has yellow pockets to keep valuables
and hold the mundu (or lungi) secure.

The 'melmundu' is an upper garment similar to the '\[neriyathu\]' that
is worn by women; 'mundu' and 'melmundu' are part of the traditional
[Malayali](Malayali "wikilink") costume worn by men.

Despite the considerable influence of western dressing forms in South
Indian culture, Hindu traditional ceremonies of Kerala (some Hindu
castes in other south Indian states) it is mandatory for the men to wear
the Mundu. For Hindu Marriages Men has to wear Mundu along with either
shirt or a 'Mel Mundu'. It is also considered appropriate for men to
wear Mundu during their visits to the temples and attending religious
functions, though it is not mandatory at all places. However, it is a
mandatory requirement to wear mundu and Mel-mundu for men to visit some
famous temples in Kerala like the [Guruvayur
Temple](Guruvayur_Temple "wikilink"), the [Padmanabhaswamy
Temple](Padmanabhaswamy_Temple "wikilink")) etc. For the convenience of
the devotees, temple managements do provide these on rent bear the
temple premises itself.

## Women

A variant called a [mundum-neriyathum](mundum-neriyathum "wikilink") is
used more often by women. The *mundum-neriyathum* is a set of two
mundus, both having matching *kara*. The set contains a lower garment
similar to those worn by men. The upper mundu, worn with a blouse, is
wrapped once around the waist and upper body and left hanging from the
left shoulder, resembling a [saree](saree "wikilink"). This is often
called a set-mundu. This is usually worn during festivals or special
occasions.

In [Kerala](Kerala "wikilink"), a *veshti* is a small piece of cloth
(generally put on the shoulders) along with a mundu, for formal
occasions.

## Kerala Lungi

In [Kerala](Kerala "wikilink") the [Lungi](Lungi "wikilink"), locally
known as *Kaili* or *Kalli Mundu*, is worn by both men and women. It is
considered a casual dress or working dress of labourers. Most men in
Kerala use lungi as home dress or sleep dress. Lungis are generally
colourful, and with varying designs. Lungis are not used during
occasions such as weddings or other religious ceremonies.
Saffron-coloured mundus are also known and *kaavi mundu*.
