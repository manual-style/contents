The **patadyong** is a pre-Hispanic wrap around loose skirt worn by
[Filipino](Filipino_people "wikilink") women[1] particularly in the
lowland regions of the [Visayan](Visayas "wikilink") islands. It is
similar to the "sarong" or [malong](malong "wikilink") used in
[Mindanao](Mindanao "wikilink") and [Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink"),
but instead of the *batik* patterns it has colourful checked designs or
patterns.[2] It is usually worn with a kimona (a blouse that was
traditionally made of pineapple fibre).[3]
