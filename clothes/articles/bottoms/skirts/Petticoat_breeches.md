**Petticoat breeches** were voluminously wide, pleated pants,
reminiscent of a skirt, worn by men in Western Europe during the 1650s
and early 1660s.[1] The very full loose [breeches](breeches "wikilink")
were usually decorated with loops of [ribbons](ribbon "wikilink") on the
waist and around the knee. They were so loose and wide that they became
known as petticoat breeches. They give very much the impression of very
baggy loose [shorts](shorts "wikilink") since they are not gathered at
the knee.

They replaced [Spanish breeches](Spanish_breeches "wikilink") during the
1650s as the most popular leg wear of most of Western Europe. By the
early 1660s, if they were gathered at the bottom they were called
[rhinegraves](rhinegraves "wikilink").
