A **poodle skirt** is a wide swing [felt](felt "wikilink")
[skirt](skirt "wikilink") of a solid color displaying a design
[appliquéd](appliqué "wikilink") or transferred to the fabric.[1] The
design was often a coiffed [poodle](poodle "wikilink"). Later
substitutes for the poodle patch included
[flamingoes](flamingo "wikilink"), [flowers](flower "wikilink"), and
[hot rod](hot_rod "wikilink") cars.[2] [Hemlines](Hemline "wikilink")
were to the knee or just below it. It quickly became very popular with
teenage girls, who wore them at [school dances](sock_hop "wikilink"),
and as everyday wear.

## Creation

The skirt originated in 1947 in the [United
States](United_States "wikilink"), designed by [Juli Lynne
Charlot](Juli_Lynne_Charlot "wikilink"). The idea for the skirt began as
Charlot needed a last-minute Christmas skirt. With little money and
little ability to sew, she made the seamless skirt herself out of
felt.[3] As Charlot's skirt caught on, she was asked to make a
dog-themed skirt, as dogs were popular. She initially designed the skirt
with three dachshunds, which would all have three personalities. The
first dog would be a flirty girl, the second dog would be a snobby girl,
and the third dog would be a male attracted to the flirty girl dog.
However, due to the leashes being tangled, the male dog would be stuck
next to the snobby girl dog. Charlot wanted her designs to tell a story
and be "conversation starters", so much that she made sure clothing
store salespeople knew the stories printed on the skirt, just in case a
customer would ask.[4]

The skirt was easy for people to make at home, since the design was
simple and the materials easily available. The original homemade skirt
could be made by cutting a circle out of felt for the waist. Then,
appliqués could be added on to reflect the person's interests and
hobbies.[5]

In just a week after the debut of the poodle skirt, Charlot was able to
sell the design. As the popularity of her skirt began to grow, she
eventually opened her own factory.[6]

## Popularity

[Movie stars](Movie_star "wikilink") commonly wore this skirt, and it
featured widely in [magazines](magazine "wikilink") and
[advertising](advertising "wikilink"), and many were eager to keep up
with Hollywood's fashions, adding to its popularity. The skirt proved
most popular with teenage girls, and in 1952 [mail-order
catalogs](mail-order_catalog "wikilink") dedicated to poodle skirts were
made.[7] Known as the "first teenage [fashion
trend](fashion_trend "wikilink")", these skirts were perfect for
dancing. It could also be said that the skirt's ability to be customized
led to its success with teenagers, as it reflected individual
personalities.[8]

## Modern poodle skirts

The poodle skirt remains one of the most memorable symbols of 1950s
[Americana](Americana "wikilink") and is frequently worn as a novelty
[retro](retro "wikilink") item, part of a nostalgic outfit. A similar
design of these skirts became popular in the years 2009-2010. The skirts
had been shortened but the newer designs retained the original
[waistband](waistband "wikilink"). Today, poodle skirts are made out of
modern felt and are simply reproductions of the originals.[9]
