![](Woman_in_rah-rah_skirt.jpg "fig:Woman_in_rah-rah_skirt.jpg") The
**rah-rah** (or **ra-ra**) **skirt** is a short
[flounced](Flounce_(fabric) "wikilink") layered skirt that originated in
[cheerleading](cheerleading "wikilink") and became a popular fashion
trend among teenage girls in the early 1980s. As such it marked, as the
*Oxford Dictionary* noted, the first successful attempt to revive the
[miniskirt](miniskirt "wikilink") that had been introduced in the
mid-1960s.[1] It was created by [Angela Stone](Angela_Stone "wikilink")
and [Gifi Fields](Gifi_Fields "wikilink"), who based the idea on
creating a [tutu](Tutu_(clothing) "wikilink") out of heavier fabric.[2]
Later in the 1980s it was often worn with leather, denim or lace.[3]

In the 1990s the mini came back into fashion in its own right, largely
discarding the frills of the rah-rah. However, the latter did return
again in Britain in 2008: "Eighties look is all the ra-rave".[4]

Examples of the rah-rah were to be seen on the covers of music albums
such as *[Since Yesterday](Since_Yesterday "wikilink")* by [Strawberry
Switchblade](Strawberry_Switchblade "wikilink") (1984).

## Etymology

*Rah-rah* is a reduplication[5] of an abbreviation for "hurrah",[6]
which is used as a synonym for "cheering".
