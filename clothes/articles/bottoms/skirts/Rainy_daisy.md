A **rainy daisy** is a style of walking skirt worn during the "[Gay
Nineties](Gay_Nineties "wikilink")" (1890–1900). The skirts were trimmed
to be 2–3 inches off the ground and were worn by members of the "Rainy
Day Club".[1][2] They were so-called because their shorter length meant
that, by not trailing and soaking up water, they were easier to keep dry
in wet weather.[3] An alternative source for the name suggests that they
were called after [Daisy Miller](Daisy_Miller "wikilink"), the eponymous
heroine of a novella by [Henry James](Henry_James "wikilink").[4]

At their shortest, the skirts could measure six inches off the ground,
which was seen as a bold statement of independence on the part of its
wearers.[5] Rainy daisy skirts influenced the development in fashion of
shorter and slimmer skirts from 1908 onwards.[6] Sometimes the skirts
were called "golf skirts" or "walking skirts" as they were practical for
sporting pursuits and walking through crowds in urban environments.[7]
