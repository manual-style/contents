A ***sarong***or***sarung*** (; meaning
"[string](String_(structure) "wikilink")" or "to sheath" in
[Indonesian](Indonesian_language "wikilink") and
[Malay](Malay_language "wikilink")) is a large tube or length of
[fabric](textile "wikilink"), often wrapped around the waist, worn in
the [Indian subcontinent](Indian_subcontinent "wikilink"), [Southeast
Asia](Southeast_Asia "wikilink"), the [Arabian
Peninsula](Arabian_Peninsula "wikilink"), [East
Africa](East_Africa "wikilink"),[1] and on many [Pacific
islands](Pacific_island "wikilink"). The fabric often has woven
[plaid](plaid_(pattern) "wikilink") or checkered patterns, or may be
brightly colored by means of [batik](batik "wikilink") or
[ikat](ikat "wikilink") [dyeing](dyeing "wikilink"). Many modern sarongs
have [printed](printed "wikilink") designs, often depicting
[animals](animal "wikilink") or [plants](plant "wikilink"). Different
types of sarongs are worn in different places in the world, notably, the
[lungi](lungi "wikilink") in the Indian subcontinent and the
[izaar](izaar "wikilink") in the Arabian Peninsula.

textile.jpg\|Sarung denotes a length of fabric as a
[garment](garment "wikilink").

*Sarong* or "sarung" denotes the lower garment worn by the Indonesian
(and other [Maritime Southeast
Asian](Maritime_Southeast_Asia "wikilink")) men. This consists of length
of fabric about a yard (0.91 m) wide and two-and-a-half yards (2.3 m)
long. In the center of this sheet, across the narrower width, a panel of
contrasting color or pattern about one foot wide is woven or dyed into
the fabric, which is known as the *kepala* or "head" of the sarong. This
sheet is stitched at the narrower edges to form a tube. One steps into
this tube, brings the upper edge above the level of the navel (the hem
should be level with the ankles), positions the *kepala* at the center
of the back, and folds in the excess fabric from both sides to the front
center, where they overlap and secures the sarong by rolling the upper
hem down over itself. Malay men wear sarongs woven in a check pattern;
women wear sarongs dyed in the [batik](batik "wikilink") method, with,
for example, flower motifs, and in brighter colors. However, in
[Javanese culture](Javanese_people "wikilink"), the wearing of batik
sarung is not restricted to women on formal occasions such as weddings.

The sarong is common wear for women, in formal settings with a
*[kebaya](kebaya "wikilink")* blouse. Malay men wear sarongs in public
only when attending Friday prayers at the [mosque](mosque "wikilink"),
but sarongs remain very common casual wear at home for men of all
ethnicities and religions in [Brunei](Brunei "wikilink"),
[Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink"),
[Philippines](Philippines "wikilink"), [Malaysia](Malaysia "wikilink"),
[Singapore](Singapore "wikilink"), [Sri
Lanka](Sarong#Sri_Lanka "wikilink"), and much of the Indian
subcontinent.[2] (In the Indian subcontinent, excluding Sri Lanka,
sarongs are typically known as *[mundu](mundu "wikilink")* or
*[lungi](lungi "wikilink")*).

## Regional variations

### Arabian Peninsula

sarongs. Bait al-Faqih.jpg\|[Yemeni](Yemen "wikilink") man tying his
*futah* (sarong). Sometimes people keep money and other small utensils
in the folds of the futah.

Sarongs known under a variety of local names are traditionally worn by
the people of [Yemen](Yemen "wikilink") and elsewhere on the [Arabian
Peninsula](Arabian_Peninsula "wikilink"). Local names for the garment
include *fūṭah*, *[izaar](izaar "wikilink")*, *wizār* and *maʿwaz* (pl.
*maʿāwiz*). In [Hadhramawt](Hadhramawt "wikilink") sarong is called
*ṣārūn* in the interior and *ṣārūm* in the coastal region. In
[Oman](Oman "wikilink"), sarongs are called *wizār* and are often white
in color, similar to the [Keralan](Kerala "wikilink")
*[mundu](mundu "wikilink")* of the Indian subcontinent and it is usually
worn under the [Thawb](Thawb "wikilink"). In [Saudi
Arabia](Saudi_Arabia "wikilink"), sarongs are known as
[izaar](izaar "wikilink"). Designs can be checkered or striped as well
floral or [arabesque](Arabesque_(Islamic_art) "wikilink"), but double
plaid (i.e., a vertical section of the *izār* with a different plaid
pattern) designs from [Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink") are also very
popular. In southwestern Saudi Arabia, tribal groups have their own
style of unstitched izaar, which is locally woven. This is also worn in
northern Yemen. However, the tribal groups in Yemen each have their own
design for their *fūṭah*, the latter of which may include tassels and
fringes. It is thought that these tribal *futah* resemble the original
izaar as worn on the [Arabian Peninsula](Arabian_Peninsula "wikilink")
since pre-Islamic times such as the [Shendyt](Shendyt "wikilink"). They
are generally worn open and unstitched in such a way that the garment
does not reach over one's ankles. Other izaars, often imported from
Bangladesh, are the traditional clothing of [Arab](Arab "wikilink")
fishermen of the [Persian Gulf](Persian_Gulf "wikilink"), the [Indian
Ocean](Indian_Ocean "wikilink") and the [Red Sea](Red_Sea "wikilink").
It was the traditional garment for men before the introduction of
pant-like pajamas and [kaftans](kaftan "wikilink") during the Turkish
and European colonial periods. Tube-stitched, as well as open sarongs,
are both worn, even in formal [dishdasha](Thawb "wikilink")-wearing
countries, as casual sleepwear and at home.

### Indian subcontinent

Bhangra dancers in lungi.

Sarongs, very similar to those of South-East Asia and completely
different from the Indian subcontinent (excluding Sri Lanka) are
widespread – in the state of [Manipur](Manipur "wikilink"), where they
are called *[Phanek](Phanek "wikilink")* and
*[Mekhela](Mekhela "wikilink")* in [Assam](Assam "wikilink") which are
very similar to traditional attires of other South-East Asian nations.
In the South [Indian](India "wikilink") states of
[Kerala](Kerala "wikilink"), where they are called
*[mundu](mundu "wikilink")* (if fully white or fully black) and
*[lungi](lungi "wikilink")* or *[kaili](lungi "wikilink")* if coloured,
and [Tamil Nadu](Tamil_Nadu "wikilink"), where they are called
*[kaili](lungi "wikilink")* or *[saaram](lungi "wikilink")* or
*[vetti](veshti "wikilink")* or *[lungi](lungi "wikilink")* and are
usually worn at home. A standard lungi measures 2.12 by 1.2 metres.

Unlike the brightly colored Southeast Asian sarongs, the Kerala variety
(the mundu) is more often plain white and is worn for ceremonial or
religious purposes. In Kerala, the brightly coloured sarongs are called
*kaily* and the white ones are called mundu. The more formal, all-white
[dhoti](dhoti "wikilink") is worn for formal and religious occasions.
While there are dresses based on the mundu which can be worn by women,
they more commonly wear the [sari](sari "wikilink").

#### Sri Lanka

Sarongs are very common in [Sri Lanka](Sri_Lanka "wikilink") and worn
only by men. (A similar garment is worn by women. However, the women's
garment is called "redda", which is wrap-around skirt.) It is the
standard garment for most men in rural and even some urban communities.
However, most men of upper social classes (whose public attire is
trousers) wear the sarong only as a convenient night garment or only
within the confines of the house.

Statistically, the number of people wearing sarong as their primary
public attire is on the decline in [Sri Lanka](Sri_Lanka "wikilink");
the reason being that the sarong carries the stigma of being the attire
for less educated lower social classes. However, there is a trend toward
adopting sarong as a fashionable garment or as a formal garment worn
with national pride, only on special occasions.[3] Political and social
leaders of Sri Lanka who want to portray their humility and closeness to
"common man" and their nationalism, choose a variation of the sarong
nicknamed the "national" as their public attire.

### Horn of Africa

Sarongs are ubiquitous in [Somalia](Somalia "wikilink") and the
[Muslim](Muslim "wikilink")-inhabited areas of the [Horn of
Africa](Horn_of_Africa "wikilink"). Although [nomadic](nomad "wikilink")
and urban [Somali](Somali_people "wikilink") men have worn them for
centuries in the form of a plain white [skirt](skirt "wikilink"), the
colorful *macawiis* (ma'awiis) sarong, which is the most popular form of
the garment in the region, is a relatively recent arrival to Somalia
courtesy of trade with the [Southeast Asian
islands](Southeast_Asia "wikilink") and the [Indian
subcontinent](Indian_subcontinent "wikilink"). Before the 1940s, most
macawiis were made of [cotton](cotton "wikilink"). However, since the
industrialization of the market for sarongs, they now come in many
fabrics and combinations thereof, including
[polyester](polyester "wikilink"), [nylon](nylon "wikilink") and
[silk](silk "wikilink").

Designs vary greatly and range from checkered square motifs with
watermarked diamonds and [plaid](plaid_(pattern) "wikilink") to simple
geometric lines. The one constant is that they tend to be quite
colorful; black *macawiis* are rare. Sarongs in Somalia are worn around
the waist and folded several times over to secure their position. They
are typically sold pre-sewn as one long circular stretch of cloth,
though some vendors offer to sew them as a
[value-added](value-added "wikilink") service.

### Western world

In North and South America as well as Europe, hip wraps are worn as
beach wear or as a cover-up over [swimwear](swimwear "wikilink"). The
wrap is often made of a thin, light fabric, often
[rayon](rayon "wikilink"), and may feature decorative fringing on both
sides. They may have ties, which are long thin straps of fabric which
the wearer can tie together to prevent the wrap from falling down. These
wraps are mostly worn by women as beach cover ups and do not usually
resemble traditional Asian or African sarongs in size, pattern or
design. Western men who wear male sarongs are influenced by the Scottish
kilt or lava-lava within the Polynesian or Samoan culture. Typically
sarongs are worn by men when they are at home or at the beach or as a
cover up on a nude beach or by the pool or on a cruise.[4]

## Securing

Numerous tying methods exist to hold a sarong to the wearer's body. In
some cases, these techniques customarily differ according to the sex of
wearer. If a sarong has ties, they may be used to hold it in place.
Sarong ties give the wearer a little extra hold and security.[5] If no
ties exist, a pin may be used, the fabric may be tightly tucked under
itself in layers, the corners of the main sheet may be around the body
and knotted, or a [belt](belt_(clothing) "wikilink") may be used to hold
the sarong in place.

## In the media

The American public is most familiar with the sarong for the dozens of
[films](film "wikilink") set in the South Seas, most of them romantic
dramas made in the 1930s and 1940s. [Dorothy
Lamour](Dorothy_Lamour "wikilink") is by far the actress most linked
with the garment, which was designed by [Edith
Head](Edith_Head "wikilink"). Lamour starred in multiple films of this
genre, starting with *[The
Hurricane](The_Hurricane_(1937_film) "wikilink")* in 1937. In fact,
Lamour was nicknamed "The Sarong Girl" by the press and even wore a
sarong on occasion in more traditional films. Among the other actresses
to don the sarong for film roles are [Maria
Montez](Maria_Montez "wikilink"), [Gilda Gray](Gilda_Gray "wikilink"),
[Myrna Loy](Myrna_Loy "wikilink"), [Gene
Tierney](Gene_Tierney "wikilink"), [Frances
Farmer](Frances_Farmer "wikilink") and [Movita](Movita "wikilink"). Male
stars who wore the manly sarongs on film include [Jon
Hall](Jon_Hall_(actor) "wikilink"), [Ray
Milland](Ray_Milland "wikilink"), [Tyrone
Power](Tyrone_Power "wikilink"), [Robert
Preston](Robert_Preston_(actor) "wikilink"), [Sabu
Dastagir](Sabu_Dastagir "wikilink") and [Ralph
Fiennes](Ralph_Fiennes "wikilink") in *[The Constant
Gardener](The_Constant_Gardener_(film) "wikilink")*. The sarong was also
worn by Pierce Brosnan in *[The Thomas Crown
Affair](The_Thomas_Crown_Affair_(1999_film) "wikilink")* (1999). The
2005 documentary film *Soldiers in Sarong*, directed by Lokendra
Arambam, depicts the women's resistance movement in [Manipur, North-East
India](Manipur "wikilink").[8] In Singapore, the term *[Sarong Party
Girl](Sarong_Party_Girl "wikilink")* refers to a local single
Singaporean woman especially of Chinese ethnicity who favour socializing
and having relationships with expatriate Caucasian men rather than the
local ones.
