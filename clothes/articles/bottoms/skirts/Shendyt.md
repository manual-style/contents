who wears a [shendyt](shendyt "wikilink"), from [Neues
Museum](Neues_Museum "wikilink") (Berlin, Germany)\]\] The **shendyt**
was a [kilt](kilt "wikilink")-like garment worn in [ancient
Egypt](ancient_Egypt "wikilink"). It was made of cloth and was worn
around the waist, typically extending to above the knees. Shendyts are
depicted on pharaohs, deities, and commoners in a variety of situations
in Egyptian artwork.

The shendyt may have been an adaptation of early hunting skirts which
allowed freedom of movement for the wearer. Members of the military wore
a version of the shendyt, as they too would need freedom of movement in
battle. Shendyts worn by those of higher rank or class would have been
made of finer materials.
