![](Phuan_Girls.JPG "fig:Phuan_Girls.JPG") The **sinh** (, ; , ) is a
traditional garment worn by [Lao](Lao_people "wikilink") and
[Thai](Thai_people "wikilink") women, particularly [northern
Thai](Northern_Thai_people "wikilink") and [northeastern
Thai](Isan_people "wikilink") women. It is a tube
[skirt](skirt "wikilink") which can identify the woman who wears it in a
variety of ways. In particular, it can indicate which region the wearer
is from. In present-day Thailand, sinhs are typically worn in special
events. However, in Laos sinhs are worn more regularly in daily life.

A sinh is typically composed of three components:

-   ** (), literally "the head of the sinh", is the
    [waistband](waistband "wikilink") part, which is typically tucked in
    and hidden.
-   ** () or ** (), literally "the body of the sinh", is the body part
    which is the main part of the sinh. This part of the sinh is
    typically not detailed. In particular, it typically only consists of
    one or two colors.
-   ** (), literally "the foot of the sinh", is the
    [hem](hem "wikilink") part. The hem is typically woven with a lot of
    details. The specific details of the hem can indicate where the sinh
    is made.

## Textiles

The sinh is made of [silk](silk "wikilink"), woven in ornate motifs with
delicate embroidery. They come in different textures and designs and are
usually created in rural areas by ethnic groups.
