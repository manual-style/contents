A **skirt** is the lower part of a [dress](dress "wikilink") or
[gown](gown "wikilink"), covering the person from the waist downwards,
or a separate outer [garment](garment "wikilink") serving this
purpose.[1]

The [hemline](hemline "wikilink") of skirts can vary from
[micro](microskirt "wikilink") to floor-length and can vary according to
[cultural](Culture "wikilink") conceptions of
[modesty](modesty "wikilink") and [aesthetics](aesthetics "wikilink") as
well as the wearer's personal taste, which can be
[influenced](Consumer_behaviour "wikilink") by such factors as
[fashion](fashion "wikilink") and social context. Most skirts are
self-standing garments, but some skirt-looking panels may be part of
another garment such as [leggings](leggings "wikilink"),
[shorts](shorts "wikilink"), and [swimsuits](skirtini "wikilink").

In modern times skirts are typically worn by women with some exceptions
such as the [izaar](izaar "wikilink") which is worn by
[Muslim](Muslim "wikilink") cultures and the [kilt](kilt "wikilink")
which is a traditional [men's](man "wikilink") garment in
[Scotland](Scotland "wikilink") and [Ireland](Ireland "wikilink") and
sometimes [England](England "wikilink"). Fashion designers such as [Jean
Paul Gaultier](Jean_Paul_Gaultier "wikilink"), [Vivienne
Westwood](Vivienne_Westwood "wikilink"), [Kenzo](Kenzo "wikilink") and
[Marc Jacobs](Marc_Jacobs "wikilink") have shown [men's
skirts](men's_skirts "wikilink"). Transgressing social codes, Gaultier
frequently introduces the skirt into his men's wear collections as a
means of injecting novelty into male attire, most famously the sarong
seen on [David Beckham](David_Beckham "wikilink").[2]

At its simplest, a skirt can be a [draped
garment](draped_garment "wikilink") made out of a single piece of fabric
(such as [pareos](pareo "wikilink")), but most skirts are fitted to the
body at the waist or hips and fuller below, with the fullness introduced
by means of [darts](Dart_(sewing) "wikilink"), gores,
[pleats](pleat "wikilink"), or panels. Modern skirts are usually made of
light to mid-weight [fabrics](textile "wikilink"), such as
[denim](denim "wikilink"), jersey, worsted, or poplin. Skirts of thin or
clingy fabrics are often worn with [slips](Slip_(clothing) "wikilink")
to make the material of the skirt drape better and for modesty.

## History

![](Fur_skirt.jpg "fig:Fur_skirt.jpg") skirt, ca. 3.000 BC\]\]
![](Egyptian_kilt.jpg "fig:Egyptian_kilt.jpg")
![](BronzeAge01.jpg "fig:BronzeAge01.jpg") tomb in Borum Eshøj
(Danmark)\]\] ![](Vincha_066.jpg "fig:Vincha_066.jpg") Skirts have been
worn since prehistoric times as the simplest way to cover the lower
body. Figurines produced by the Vinča culture (c.5700-4500 BC) located
on the territory of present day Serbia and neighboring Balkan nations
from the start of the copper age show women in skirt-like garments.[3]

A straw-woven skirt dating to 3.900 BC was discovered in
[Armenia](Armenia "wikilink") at the [Areni-1 cave
complex](Areni-1_cave_complex "wikilink").[4] Skirts were the standard
attire for men and women in all ancient cultures in the [Near
East](Near_East "wikilink") and [Egypt](Egypt "wikilink"). The
[Sumerians](Sumer "wikilink") in [Mesopotamia](Mesopotamia "wikilink")
wore [kaunakes](kaunakes "wikilink"), a type of fur skirt tied to a
belt. The term "kaunakes" originally referred to a sheep's fleece, but
eventually came to be applied to the garment itself. Eventually, the
animal pelts were replaced by kaunakes cloth, a textile that imitated
fleecy sheep skin.[5] Kaunakes cloth also served as a symbol in
religious iconography, such as in the fleecy cloak of [St. John the
Baptist](St._John_the_Baptist "wikilink").[6][7]

Ancient Egyptian garments were mainly made of linen. For the upper
classes, they were beautifully woven and intricately pleated.[8] Around
2,130 BC, during the [Old Kingdom of
Egypt](Old_Kingdom_of_Egypt "wikilink"), men wore wraparound skirts
(kilts) known as the [shendyt](shendyt "wikilink"). They were made of a
rectangular piece of cloth wrapped around the lower body and tied in
front. By the [Middle Kingdom of
Egypt](Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt "wikilink"), longer skirts, reaching from
the waist to ankles and sometimes hanging from the armpits, became
fashionable. During the [New Kingdom of
Egypt](New_Kingdom_of_Egypt "wikilink"), kilts with a pleated triangular
section became fashionable for men.[9] Beneath these, a shente, or
triangular loincloth whose ends were fastened with cord ties, were
worn.[10]

During the [Bronze Age](Bronze_Age "wikilink"), in the Southern parts of
Western and Central Europe, wraparound dress-like garments were
preferred. However, in Northern Europe, people also wore skirts and
blouses.[11]

In the [Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink"), men and women preferred
dress-like garments. The lower part of men's dresses were much shorter
in length compared to those for women. They were wide cut and often
pleated or gored so that horse riding was more comfortable. Even a
[knight's](Knight "wikilink") armor had a short metal skirt below the
breastplate. It covered the straps attaching the upper legs iron cuisse
to the breastplate. Technological advances in weaving in the 13-15th
century, like foot-treadle floor [looms](loom "wikilink") and
[scissors](scissors "wikilink") with pivoted blades and handles,
improved tailoring trousers and tights. They became fashionable for men
and henceforth became standard male attire whilst becoming taboo for
women.[12][13]

Skirts are still worn by men and women from many cultures, such as the
[lungi](lungi "wikilink"), [lehnga](lehnga "wikilink"),
[kanga](Kanga_(African_garment) "wikilink") and
[sarong](sarong "wikilink") worn in [South Asia](South_Asia "wikilink")
and [Southeast Asia](Southeast_Asia "wikilink"), and the
[kilt](kilt "wikilink") worn in [Scotland](Scotland "wikilink") and
[Ireland](Ireland "wikilink").

One of the earliest known cultures to have females wear clothing
resembling [miniskirts](miniskirt "wikilink") were the Duan Qun
[Miao](Miao_people "wikilink") (短裙苗), which literally meant "short
skirt Miao" in [Chinese](Chinese_language "wikilink"). This was in
reference to the short miniskirts "that barely cover the buttocks" worn
by women of the tribe, and which were probably shocking to observers in
[medieval](Middle_Ages "wikilink") and [early
modern](Early_modern_period "wikilink") times.[14]

In the Middle Ages, some upper-class women wore skirts over three metres
in diameter at the bottom. At the other extreme, the
[miniskirts](miniskirt "wikilink") of the 1960s were minimal garments
that may have barely covered the underwear when the woman was seated.
Costume historians typically use the word
"[petticoat](petticoat "wikilink")" to describe skirt-like garments of
the 18th century or earlier.

### 19th century

During the 19th century, the cut of women's [dresses](dress "wikilink")
in western culture varied more widely than in any other century.
[Waistlines](waistline_(clothing) "wikilink") started just below the
bust (the [Empire silhouette](Empire_silhouette "wikilink")) and
gradually sank to the natural waist. Skirts started fairly narrow and
increased dramatically to the [hoopskirt](hoopskirt "wikilink") and
[crinoline](crinoline "wikilink")-supported styles of the 1860s; then
fullness was draped and drawn to the back by means of
[bustles](bustle "wikilink"). In the 1890s the [rainy
daisy](rainy_daisy "wikilink") skirt was introduced for walking or
sportswear. It had a significantly shorter hemline measuring as much as
six inches off the ground and would eventually influence the wider
introduction of shorter hemlines in the early 20th century.[15]

### 20th and 21st centuries

Beginning around 1915, [hemlines](hemline "wikilink") for daytime
dresses left the floor for good. For the next fifty years fashionable
skirts became short (1920s), then long (1930s), then shorter ([the War
Years](World_War_II "wikilink") with their restrictions on fabric), then
long (the "[New Look](Christian_Dior_SE#"New_Look" "wikilink")"), then
shortest of all from 1967 to 1970, when skirts became as short as
possible while avoiding exposure of [underwear](underwear "wikilink"),
which was considered [taboo](taboo "wikilink").

Since the 1970s and the rise of [pants/trousers for
women](Women_wearing_pants "wikilink") as an option for all but the most
formal of occasions, no one skirt length has dominated fashion for long,
with short and ankle-length styles often appearing side-by-side in
fashion magazines and catalogs.

The skirt is a part of [uniform](school_uniform "wikilink") for girls in
many schools across the world, with lengths varying depending on local
culture. The [pleated](pleat "wikilink") [tartan](tartan "wikilink")
skirt has been a component of girls' [school
uniforms](school_uniform "wikilink") since the early twentieth century
in UK.[16] In the 21st century, skirt has become part of [Western dress
code](Western_dress_code "wikilink") for women and is worn as [business
casual](business_casual "wikilink") and [office
wear](office_wear "wikilink"), and also as
[sportswear](Sportswear_(activewear) "wikilink") (ex. in
[tennis](tennis "wikilink")). Skirt may also be mandatory as [formal
wear](formal_wear "wikilink"), such as for
[airhostesses](Flight_attendant "wikilink"),
[waitresses](waitresses "wikilink"), [nurses](nurses "wikilink") and
[military women](Women_in_the_military "wikilink").

## Male wear

![](Utilkilt_beige.jpg "fig:Utilkilt_beige.jpg"), 2010\]\] There are a
number of garments marketed to men which fall under the category of
"skirt" or "dress". These go by a variety of names and form part of the
traditional dress for men from various cultures. Usage varies – the
[dhoti](dhoti "wikilink") is part of everyday dress on the Indian
subcontinent while the kilt is more usually restricted to occasional
wear and the [fustanella](fustanella "wikilink") is used almost
exclusively as costume. Robes, which are a type of dress for men, have
existed in many cultures, including the Japanese
[kimono](kimono "wikilink"), the Chinese
[cheongsam](cheongsam "wikilink"), the Arabic [thobe](thobe "wikilink"),
and the African [Senegalese kaftan](Senegalese_kaftan "wikilink"). Robes
are also used in some religious orders, such as the
[cassock](cassock "wikilink") in Christianity and various robes and
cloaks that may be used in pagan rituals. Examples of men's skirts and
skirt-like garments from various cultures include:

-   The [fustanella](fustanella "wikilink") is a full-pleated skirt worn
    by men in [Albania](Albania "wikilink") and
    [Greece](Greece "wikilink") and other parts of the Balkans. By the
    mid-20th Century, it was relegated to ceremonial use and as period
    or traditional costume. It is worn by the Evzones, or Evzoni (Greek:
    Εύζωνες, Εύζωνοι, pronounced \[evˈzones, evˈzoni\]), which is the
    name of several historical elite light infantry and mountain units
    of the [Greek Army](Greek_Army "wikilink"). Today, it refers to the
    members of the Presidential Guard who parade the [presidential
    mansion](presidential_mansion "wikilink") wearing a short version of
    this historic costume.
-   The [gho](gho "wikilink") is a knee-length robe worn by men in
    [Bhutan](Bhutan "wikilink"). They are required to wear it every day
    as part of national dress in government offices, in schools and on
    formal occasions.[31]
-   The [hakama](hakama "wikilink") is worn in Japan. There are two
    types of hakama, divided umanori (馬乗り, "horse-riding hakama") and
    undivided andon hakama (行灯袴, "lantern hakama"). The umanori type
    has wide and divided legs, similar to
    [culottes](culottes "wikilink"). Some hakamas are pleated.
-   The [kilt](kilt "wikilink") is a skirt of Gaelic and Celtic history,
    part of the [Scottish](Scotland "wikilink") national dress in
    particular, and is worn formally and to a lesser extent informally.
    Irish and Welsh kilts also exist but are not so much a part of
    national identity.
-   The [sarong](sarong "wikilink") is a piece of cloth that may be
    wrapped around the waist to form a skirt-like garment. Sarongs exist
    in various cultures under various names, including the
    [pareo](pareo "wikilink") and [lavalava](lavalava "wikilink") of the
    Hawaiian islands and Polynesia (Samoa, Tonga, Tahiti, and Fiji), the
    Indian [dhoti](dhoti "wikilink") and [lungi](lungi "wikilink"), and
    the South Indian and Maldivian [mundu](mundu "wikilink").

Aside from the wearing of [kilts](kilt "wikilink"), in the [Western
world](Western_world "wikilink") skirts, dresses, and similar garments
are generally viewed exclusively women's clothing which, historically,
was not always the case.[32] However, Western men have taken up skirts
as forms of civil protest.[33] Other Western men advocate skirts as a
measure of co-equality between women and men.
