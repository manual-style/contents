A **squaw**, **fiesta**, **Kachina**, **Tohono** or **patio** dress is
an [American style of dress](Fashion_in_the_United_States "wikilink")
developed in [Arizona](Arizona "wikilink"). It became popular during the
1940s and 1950s, and many famous women owned these dresses. It was
developed primarily by [Dolores Gonzales](Dolores_Gonzales "wikilink")
and [Cele Peterson](Cele_Peterson "wikilink"), who
[appropriated](Cultural_appropriation "wikilink") the look from [Native
American fashion](Native_American_fashion "wikilink"). The word
"[squaw](squaw "wikilink")", once used for [Native American
women](Native_Americans_in_the_United_States "wikilink") and thus for
this fashion, is now seen as offensive and the other names for the
dress, such as "fiesta" or "patio", are preferred.

## About

The squaw dress could be either one or two pieces, with a two piece
"dress" consisting of a skirt and a blouse.[1] They were made with
[cotton](cotton "wikilink") or [calico print](Chintz "wikilink").[2] The
skirt part of the dress is [pleated](Pleat "wikilink"),
[gathered](Gather_(sewing) "wikilink") or fully gathered with
three-tiers.[3][4] The dresses were often colorful and incorporated
[rickrack](rickrack "wikilink") as well.[5] The hemlines sometimes
copied [Native
American](Native_Americans_in_the_United_States "wikilink") basket
designs.[6] Many squaw dresses would be accessorized with *concho*
belts, squash blossom necklaces and [turquoise](turquoise "wikilink")
earrings.[7] Later versions of the squaw dress included metallic fabrics
and [glitter](glitter "wikilink").[8][9]

The garment was described as being comfortable and flattering to most
figures, according to *[The Arizona
Republic](The_Arizona_Republic "wikilink")*.[10] The dresses were
lightweight and comfortable to wear on hot days.[11] They did not
require [ironing](ironing "wikilink").[12] In addition, the dress could
be worn for many different kinds of occasions.[13]

## History

![](Western_fashions_in_Arizona.ogg "fig:Western_fashions_in_Arizona.ogg")
The original designs that served as the basis of the squaw dress skirt
were found in [Navajo](Navajo "wikilink") broomstick skirts. These
skirts and blouses that the Navajo wore were, in turn, based on [1870s
and 1880s European fashions](1870s_in_Western_fashion "wikilink") and
fabrics.[14] By 1910, a unique style had developed which incorporated
Navajo ideals of beauty and it had become widespread among Navajo women.
The dresses also reflected a sense of "cultural revitalization, high
self-esteem, and ethnic identity," according to professor of [American
Indian studies](Native_American_studies "wikilink") Nancy Parezo and
Angelina R. Jones.[15] [Bodices](Bodice "wikilink") and
[blouses](Blouse "wikilink") worn with the skirts reflected different
origins. Loose blouses paired with the skirt came from [Western
Apache](Western_Apache_people "wikilink") and [Tohono
O'odham](Tohono_O'odham "wikilink") dress. The squaw dress also had
Mexican influences.

The different looks of the dress were based on different types of
popular [Navajo](Navajo "wikilink"), [Mexican](Mexicans "wikilink"),
[Tohono O'odham](Tohono_O'odham "wikilink") and [Western
Apache](Western_Apache_people "wikilink") dresses.
[Zuni](Zuni "wikilink") and [Hopi](Hopi "wikilink") dress were also an
inspiration.[16] The squaw dress also shows influence from the [New
Look](New_Look_(style_of_clothing) "wikilink") in fashion. Using the
term "[squaw](squaw "wikilink")" to name the dresses evoked a connection
to Native American culture. In addition, the Native American roots of
the design made the dresses seem like uniquely "American" clothing
items. The dress also became synonymous with the
[Southwest](Southwestern_United_States "wikilink").[17]

The squaw dress started out as a trend in the [American
Southwest](American_Southwest "wikilink") in the 1940s and went
nationwide in the 1950s. The first designers of the squaw dress are
unknown, however designers such as [Dolores
Gonzales](Dolores_Gonzales "wikilink") and [Cele
Peterson](Cele_Peterson "wikilink") were selling dresses they called
"squaw Dresses" by 1948. Bill and Elizabeth Macey who owned a clothing
[manufacturing plant](Factory "wikilink") called the Arizona Shirt
Company, created a design for the squaw dress as well.[18] The Maceys'
design was considered "smart," but authentic, according to *[The Arizona
Republic](The_Arizona_Republic "wikilink")*.[19] George Fine who owned
Georgie of Arizona was another major creator of the dresses.[20] [Lloyd
Kiva New](Lloyd_Kiva_New "wikilink"), a [Cherokee](Cherokee "wikilink")
designer, also created squaw dresses.[21] Eventually [J.C.
Penney](J._C._Penney "wikilink"),
[Woolworth's](F._W._Woolworth_Company "wikilink") and [Neiman
Marcus](Neiman_Marcus "wikilink") were selling versions of the squaw
dress.[22] In 1954, [Gimble's](Gimbels "wikilink") department store in
[Philadelphia](Philadelphia "wikilink") held a [fashion
show](fashion_show "wikilink") where "Princess Red Rock" modeled the
dress on the runway and the store sold versions of the dress.[23] Women
such as [Mamie Eisenhower](Mamie_Eisenhower "wikilink"), [Pat
Nixon](Pat_Nixon "wikilink"), [Cyd Charisse](Cyd_Charisse "wikilink")
and [Elsa Martinelli](Elsa_Martinelli "wikilink") were seen in these
dresses.[24][25]

Squaw dresses went out of fashion nationally by 1960, but remained
popular in the [Southwest United
States](Southwestern_United_States "wikilink") and also in [square
dancing](Square_dance "wikilink") and [rodeos](Rodeo "wikilink"). When
the style was revisited in later decades, the dresses were labeled as
"Western wear" and given new names. These dresses are today more often
called patio or fiesta dresses.[26]

## Controversy

Because the squaw dress
[appropriates](Cultural_appropriation "wikilink") from various different
Indigenous people's clothing and because of the use of the word
"[squaw](squaw "wikilink")," there were people who were uncomfortable
with the fashion. Designer [Dolores
Gonzales](Dolores_Gonzales "wikilink") admitted that she had taken the
idea for the design from Native American women's clothing.[27] In a 1954
article in *[The Arizona Daily Star](Arizona_Daily_Star "wikilink")*,
the dresses were described as "What was once worn proudly by Indian
squaws is now being worn across the country by many women."[28]
[Anthropologist](Anthropologist "wikilink") Adelaide Law believed that
the dresses were blatant ploys to cash in on "tourist trade." Curator
[Frederick H. Douglas](Frederic_Huntington_Douglas "wikilink"), who was
known for his early exhibits of [Native American
fashion](Native_American_fashion "wikilink"), felt that using the name
"squaw" was disrespectful. Around the same time the dresses went out of
fashion in the 1960s, the Native American community began to decry the
use of the word "squaw," which was seen as
[derogatory](Pejorative "wikilink"). Modern use of the word "squaw" to
describe the dress is seen as culturally insensitive.[29]
