A **sulu** is a [kilt](kilt "wikilink")-like garment worn by men and
women in [Fiji](Fiji "wikilink") since colonisation in the nineteenth
century. It was originally imported by missionaries coming from
[Tonga](Tonga "wikilink") in this time period and was worn by Fijians to
indicate their conversion to Christianity. It is now regarded as Fiji's
[national dress](national_dress "wikilink")[1] even though pre-colonial
Fijian traditional clothing consisted of clothing such as the *malo* and
the *liku*.[2]

It consists of a rectangle of cloth of varying length, between
below-knee and ankle-length, wrapped around the hips and legs and
traditionally fastened by tying at the waist. Modern men's sulus may be
fastened with [buckles](buckle "wikilink").[3]

Women's casual or everyday sulus are known as *sulu-i-ra*, and more
elegant full-length ones for dressy occasions as *sulu jaba*.[4] Men's
sulus are known as *sulu vakataga*.

Tailored sulus with pockets are commonly worn as part of Fijian men's
business and formal wear,[5][6][7] with shirt and
[sandals](sandal "wikilink") and optionally western-style jacket and
tie. In certain situations, such as entering a church, wearing a sulu is
seen as respectful.[8] Tailored sulus also feature in police and
[military uniforms](military_uniform "wikilink").[9] Official uniform
sulus come to below the knees and feature a distinctive
[zigzag](zigzag "wikilink") hem.

In Fiji the sulu is seen as an expression of [ethnic
Fijian](Fijians "wikilink") identity. While wearing a sulu is often
mandatory for Fijians in certain settings,[10][11] members of [other
ethnicities](Demographics_of_Fiji "wikilink") are sometimes discouraged
from wearing it.[12]
