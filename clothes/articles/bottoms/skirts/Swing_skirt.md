A **swing skirt** is a vintage knee-length retro
[skirt](skirt "wikilink") typical of the 1960s, but first introduced in
the 1930s.

This circular skirt tended to swing when the wearer was in motion,
movement induced by the use of numerous [pleats](pleats "wikilink") or
[tucks](Tuck_(sewing) "wikilink").
