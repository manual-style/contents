![](Phoenix_Rising_TSkirt.jpg "fig:Phoenix_Rising_TSkirt.jpg") The
**t-skirt** or (Tee-Skirt) is a skirt made of re-purposed or
"[recycled](recycled "wikilink")" [t-shirts](t-shirts "wikilink"). They
are generally knee or above the knee in length and normally highly
patterned with varied designs. The skirt is generally an "A-Line" design
which is tight around the hips and widens out in an "A" shape right down
the length of the skirt. There are also versions that are tighter in
shape which are very similar to the [pencil
skirt](pencil_skirt "wikilink").
