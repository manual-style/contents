![](funeral_mat.jpg "fig:funeral_mat.jpg") A **taovala** is a
[Tongan](Tonga "wikilink") dress, a mat wrapped around the waist, worn
by men and women, at all formal occasions, much like the
[tie](Necktie "wikilink") for men in the European and North American
culture. The ta'ovala is also commonly seen among the Fijian [Lau
Islands](Lau_Islands "wikilink"), a region once heavily influenced by
Tongan hegemony and cultural diffusion.

## Origins

According to a Tongan story, a group of Tongans once arrived by boat at
the [Tui Tonga](Tu'i_Tonga "wikilink"). They had had a rough ride and
their clothing, if any remained, was not respectable. They cut the sail
of their boat ([Polynesian](Polynesia "wikilink") sails are also mats)
in pieces and wrapped them around. The king was so pleased by the
sacrifice they had made to him of their expensive sail that he ordered
this dress to be court dress from then on. The Tongan waist-mat probably
shares a common origin or inspiration as the
[Samoan](Samoan_language "wikilink") "valatau" or "vala" waistband often
donned by orators and chiefly sons ("manaia") and daughters ("taupou")
on festive occasions and rituals.

Queen [Salote Tupou III](Salote_Tupou_III "wikilink") ordered the
taovala to be part of the civil servants' uniform. The use of the
taovala for men is therefore extremely common in Tonga. For women it is
somewhat less common, as they prefer a
[kiekie](kiekie_(clothing) "wikilink").

The normal taovala, for everyday neat wear, is a short mat, coming
halfway up the thighs. It is tied with a rope (*kafa*, often made of
coconut [coir](coir "wikilink") or of human hair of a deceased ancestor)
wrapped around the waist. The mat worn on festive occasions, like a
marriage, is much larger and often very nicely decorated. Likewise the
taovala for a [funeral](Tongan_funerals "wikilink") is also a huge mat,
but much coarser, not decorated. If the wearer has an inferior rank
towards the deceased, the mat is old and torn. The older and more torn
it is, the better. All these special mats are kept as precious
heirlooms.

Taovala are part of the [koloa](koloa "wikilink"), the handicraft goods
made by the women. Every woman can do it. If girls do not learn it at
home, it will be taught at school. More recently, however, some women
specialise in the handicraft and sell their products on the market.

## Materials

Taovala can be made from different materials, natural and introduced:

-   Strips of [pandanus](pandanus "wikilink") leaves, usually unpainted,
    although sometimes black strips are used, and rarely the whole
    taovala is black. The strips range from coarse (15Â mm or so as for
    funerals) to fine (a couple of millimeters, as the *taovala
    loukeha*, in which one is dressed to visit the king). Mats are
    always woven by hand. Especially the fine mats are therefore very
    laborious to make, take a long time to complete and are expensive.
    The oldest and most valuable Tongan fine mats are preserved and worn
    by the Tongan royal family on formal occasions.
-   Strips of [hibiscus](hibiscus "wikilink") bast fiber, called *fau*.
    Same as the pandanus leaves, but not as coarse and as such they can
    be plaited in a variety of patterns, which is faster and cheaper
    than to weave them by hand. Most of the 'civil servants' taovala are
    made in this way.
-   Plastic, particularly those obtained from old flour bags - preferred
    as a quick alternative.

## History

Before the advent of [Western influence](Western_culture "wikilink"),
the men wore a fringe skirt of native materials about long. Women
traditionally[1] wore two mats about a yard (metre) square each, made by
weaving pandanus and hibiscus leaves together,[2] and belted around the
waist.[3] Children were usually naked.[4][5] The Christian missionaries
who began arriving in the late 19th century influenced the islanders'
notions of modesty.
