**Tupenu** is the [Tongan](Tongan_language "wikilink") term for a
wrapped garment also called a [sarong](sarong "wikilink"),
[lungi](lungi "wikilink"), or [lava-lava](lava-lava "wikilink"), worn
through much of [South Asia](South_Asia "wikilink"), [Southeast
Asia](Southeast_Asia "wikilink"), [Arabian
peninsula](Arabian_peninsula "wikilink"), the [Horn of
Africa](Horn_of_Africa "wikilink") and [Oceania](Oceania "wikilink"). It
is analogous to the [kilt](kilt "wikilink") worn in
[Scotland](Scotland "wikilink").

The tupenu worn by women is wide enough to cover the body between the
waist and ankles, and long enough to wrap securely around the waist. The
standard width of cloth yardage (45Â inches) is generally wide enough, so
a tupenu can be made in a matter of minutes by cutting and wrapping
cloth from the bolt. Women wear a knee length dress, or *kofu*, over the
tupenu. On dress occasions, women wear matching kofu and tupenu, sewn
from the same yardage. Fancy tupenus are often slightly tailored, with
darts sewn into the top, so that they will fit the body more closely. On
ceremonial occasions, women wear a [ta'ovala](ta'ovala "wikilink"), or
finely woven [pandanus](pandanus "wikilink") mat, over the kofu and
tupenu. The [kiekie](kiekie_(clothing) "wikilink"), a kind of grass or
string [skirt](skirt "wikilink"), is an acceptable, comfortable
alternative to the ta'ovala on most occasions.

The tupenu worn by men is wide enough to cover the body between the
waist and knees, and long enough to wrap securely around the waist. For
work and casual wear, any piece of cloth will do. On dress occasions,
men will wear tupenu tailored like Western wrap skirts and made from
[suit](suit_(clothing) "wikilink") material. These tupenu coordinate
with Western suit-jackets. Usually the formal tupenu will be covered
with a [ta'ovala](ta'ovala "wikilink") worn as a sign of respect. The
man's ta'ovala is analogous to the Western
[necktie](necktie "wikilink").
