The **tutu** is a [dress](dress "wikilink") worn as a
[costume](costume "wikilink") in a [classical
ballet](classical_ballet "wikilink") performance, often with attached
[bodice](bodice "wikilink").[1] It may be made of
[tarlatan](tarlatan "wikilink"), muslin, silk, tulle, gauze, or nylon.
Modern tutus have two basic types: the Romantic tutu is soft and
bell-shaped, reaching the calf or ankle; the Classical tutu is short and
stiff, projecting horizontally from the waist and hip.[2]

## Etymology

The derivation of the word *[tutu](tutu_(disambiguation) "wikilink")* is
unknown. The word was not recorded anywhere until 1881. One theory is
that it is simply derived from the word
*[tulle](Tulle_(netting) "wikilink")* (one of the materials from which
it is made).

Another theory is that it derives from French babytalk for bottom
(*cucul*): during that era, the *abonnés* (rich male subscribers at the
[Paris Opera Ballet](Paris_Opera_Ballet "wikilink")) were encouraged to
mix with the ballet girls in the foyer, and arrange assignations.[3] It
is suggested the expression came from the abonnés playfully patting the
back of the tulle dress with the saying *pan-pan cucul* (French for
*I'll spank your bottom*).

A third, related theory suggests a derivation from the more vulgar
French word, "cul" (which can be used to refer to the bottom or genital
area). During this era, women (including dancers) wore
[pantalettes](pantalettes "wikilink") as underwear, which were open at
the crotch. The abonnés favoured the very front rows in the hope of a
scandalous view, and the skirt was modified for that reason. This is
supported by the description by nineteenth-century balletomane, [Charles
Nuitter](Charles-Louis-Étienne_Nuitter "wikilink"), who defined *tutu*
as "a slang term for the very short petticoat worn by *danseuses* in the
interest of modesty."[4]

## History

The skirt that became known as the romantic tutu made its first
appearance in 1832 at the Paris Opera, where [Marie
Taglioni](Marie_Taglioni "wikilink") wore a gauzy white skirt cut to
reveal her ankles, designed by Eugene Lami in *[La
Sylphide](La_Sylphide "wikilink")*.[5] From the late 19th century
onwards, the tutu was steadily shortened, for ease of movement and to
show off the dancer's legs.[6]

Fashion designers have often been involved in design for ballet.[7]
Fashion designers including Cecil Beaton, Christian Lacroix, and Isaac
Mizrahi in the United States have all designed tutus. Among the leading
makers of tutus around the world, few designers have matched the
reputation of [Barbara Karinska](Barbara_Karinska "wikilink")
(1886-1983), [Ukrainian](Ukraine "wikilink") costumer for the New York
City Ballet for many years, She designed and constructed tutus of
extraordinary beauty and durability.[8]
