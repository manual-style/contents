In the context of clothing, a **wrap** can refer to a
[shawl](shawl "wikilink") or [stole](stole_(shawl) "wikilink") or other
fabric wrapped about the upper body, or a simple skirt-type garment made
by wrapping a piece of material round the lower body. Many people of
both genders throughout the world wear wraps in everyday life, although
in the West they are largely worn by women. They are sometimes sewn at
the edges to form a tube which keeps the required size. A wrap may be
secured by a corner being tucked beneath the wrapped material, by making
a knot, or using ties, buttons or velcro.[1]

-   [Longyi](Longyi "wikilink")

    Peninsula](Arabian_Peninsula "wikilink"), the [Horn of
    Africa](Horn_of_Africa "wikilink"), and on many [Pacific
    islands](Pacific_island "wikilink").
