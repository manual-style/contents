**Bermuda shorts**, also known as **walk shorts**[1] or **dress
shorts**, are a particular type of short
[trousers](trousers "wikilink"), worn as semi-casual attire by both men
and women. The [hem](hem "wikilink"), which can be
[cuffed](cuff "wikilink") or un-cuffed, is around 1 inch above the
[knee](knee "wikilink").

They are so-named because of their popularity in
[Bermuda](Bermuda "wikilink"), a [British Overseas
Territory](British_Overseas_Territory "wikilink"), where they are
considered appropriate business attire for men when made of suit-like
material and worn with [knee](knee "wikilink")-length
[socks](sock "wikilink"), a [dress shirt](dress_shirt "wikilink"),
[tie](necktie "wikilink"), and [blazer](blazer "wikilink"). They are
considered more appropriate in hot subtropical and tropical climates
than the typical heavier clothing favored in Europe. Many businesses in
the West today that have a business casual policy similarly allow this
kind of clothing in the hotter seasons, especially in the United States,
Australia, and New Zealand. They are available in a variety of colours,
including many pastel shades as well as darker shades.

True Bermuda shorts are not to be confused with "[capri
pants](capri_pants "wikilink")" extending below the knee. [Cargo
shorts](Shorts "wikilink") may be a similar length but are typically
baggy or less "tailored" than Bermuda shorts and more typical of West
Coast American fashion.

## History

Bermuda shorts originated with the [British
Army](British_Army "wikilink") for wear in tropical and desert climates,
and they are still worn by the [Royal Navy](Royal_Navy "wikilink"), as
well as the [Royal Canadian Navy](Royal_Canadian_Navy "wikilink").
During the Second World War there was a shortage of clothing in Bermuda.
According to Jack Lightbourn, former Executive Vice President of the
Bank of Bermuda, the general managers of the two banks in Bermuda, [The
Bank of Bermuda Ltd](HSBC_Bank_Bermuda "wikilink") and [The Bank of N.T.
Butterfield and Sons Ltd](Butterfield_Bank "wikilink") were concerned
that their male employees would not have suitable clothing to wear. They
arranged for a local tailor to make two pairs of shorts, modeled on the
shorts of the British military, for each of their male employees. The
shorts were made from a very itchy grey flannel material, and each
employee was supplied with two pairs of heavy grey wool long socks to
wear with the shorts. This was the beginning of Bermuda shorts as
business attire in Bermuda.[2] In the post-war period local merchants
such as Trimingham Bros. and H.A. & E. Smiths improved the design of the
shorts and used bright coloured materials as the shorts became more
popular.

During the opening ceremonies of the [Olympics](Olympics "wikilink") and
[Paralympics](Paralympics "wikilink"), Bermuda's delegation
traditionally wears red Bermuda shorts (red being the primary color in
the country's [flag](Flag_of_Bermuda "wikilink")).
