![](Pantalonbondage01.jpg "fig:Pantalonbondage01.jpg") **Bondage pants**
or **bondage trousers** are [trousers](trousers "wikilink") with
[zippers](zipper "wikilink"), straps, chains, rings and buckles, giving
an appearance of a [BDSM](BDSM "wikilink") style. They come in a variety
of colors and patterns; one of the most common patterns being
[tartan](tartan "wikilink"). They also come in a variety of styles,
including tight or baggy, long, [short](Shorts "wikilink") or
[Capri](Capri_pants "wikilink").

They have mainly been worn by members of youth
[subcultures](subculture "wikilink"), including
[punks](Punk_fashion "wikilink"), [ravers](rave "wikilink"),
[goths](Gothic_fashion "wikilink") and [Otaku](Otaku "wikilink").

The more popular of the pants seems to be the 'original' black style,
with white stitching, although different colored versions including
white, hot pink, blue, and green have been made with equally varied
colors of stitching.

There has been some controversy at certain schools in the United States
about the bondage pants being a danger to school property and also for
supposed sexual inappropriateness, even to the extent of banning the
pants.

## History

### Origins

![](Camden_Town_street_advertising.jpg "fig:Camden_Town_street_advertising.jpg")
in [London](London "wikilink") wearing black bondage trousers\]\]
Although many people consider these pants an element of fetish wear,
many early punks have said the origins of the pants were from homeless
people who put straps on their pants so they could hold on to a train.
They were developed by British designers [Vivienne
Westwood](Vivienne_Westwood "wikilink") and [Malcolm
McLaren](Malcolm_McLaren "wikilink") in the 1970s [punk
subculture](punk_subculture "wikilink"). The trousers were made infamous
by people such as the [Sex Pistols](Sex_Pistols "wikilink"), Jordan and
[Adam Ant](Adam_Ant "wikilink") who would have to originally get them
from Westwood/McClarens shop [SEX](SEX_(boutique) "wikilink"), later to
become Seditionaries, in [World's End,
Chelsea](World's_End,_Chelsea "wikilink"), [London](London "wikilink").
The original [drainpipe](Drainpipe_trousers "wikilink") design was an
anti fashion statement against the [flares](Bell-bottoms "wikilink") of
the time. The men's variety tend to feature baggier legs, larger pockets
and more metal details such as chains, skulls, mock handcuffs and
D-rings while the women's styles are usually more tailored and have less
metal hardware decoration than the men's styles but occasionally have
details of lace, ribbon or tartan making them seem more feminine.

### Further development

In the late 1990s and early-to-mid 2000s, [Tripp
NYC](Tripp_NYC "wikilink")'s signature design that combined the chains
and straps of Bondage pants with the baggy legs and bright linings of
[phat pants](phat_pants "wikilink") became incredibly popular amongst
U.S. teenagers, although they also held some minor popularity amongst
college students then in their early 20s, and were worn on stage by
members of some [nu-metal](nu-metal "wikilink"), [industrial
rock](industrial_rock "wikilink"), and [darkwave](darkwave "wikilink")
bands. Additionally, during that time period this style of [phat
pants](phat_pants "wikilink")-inspired bondage pants became frequently
observable among members of the [goth](Goth_subculture "wikilink"),
[heavy metal](heavy_metal_music "wikilink"), [gamer](gamer "wikilink"),
and [raver](rave "wikilink") subcultures. Such pants were a popular sell
for chain stores such as [Hot Topic](Hot_Topic "wikilink")[1] and
[Spencer's Gifts](Spencer's_Gifts "wikilink"), and ranged from
observable to ubiquitous at [alternative
music](alternative_music "wikilink") (especially [Electronic
music](Electronic_music "wikilink") and [Hard
Rock](Hard_Rock "wikilink")) nightclubs and [anime
conventions](anime_conventions "wikilink") prior to a gradual decline in
popularity and visibility from the late 2000s through early 2010s.
