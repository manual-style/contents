[Ralph Earl](Ralph_Earl "wikilink"), 1789.\]\] **Breeches** ( )[1] are
an article of [clothing](clothing "wikilink") covering the body from the
[waist](waist "wikilink") down, with separate coverings for each
[leg](human_leg "wikilink"), usually stopping just below the knee,
though in some cases reaching to the ankles. The breeches were normally
closed and fastened about the leg, along its open seams at varied
lengths, and to the knee, by either buttons or by a
[drawstring](drawstring "wikilink"), or by one or more straps and
[buckle](buckle "wikilink") or [brooches](brooch "wikilink"). Formerly a
standard item of [Western](Western_world "wikilink") men's clothing,
they had fallen out of use by the mid-19th century in favour of
[trousers](trousers "wikilink"). Modern athletic garments used for
[English riding](English_riding "wikilink") and
[fencing](fencing "wikilink"), although called*breeches*or*britches'',
differ from breeches in ways discussed below.

## Etymology

*Breeches* is a [double plural](double_plural "wikilink") known since c.
1205, from [Old English](Old_English "wikilink") , the plural of
"garment for the legs and trunk", from the
[Proto-Germanic](Proto-Germanic_language "wikilink") word *\*brōk-*,
plural *\*brōkiz* whence also the [Old Norse](Old_Norse "wikilink") word
, which shows up in the epithet of the Viking king [Ragnar
Loðbrók](Ragnar_Lodbrok "wikilink"), Ragnar "Hairy-breeches".

Like other words for similar garments (e.g., *pants*, *knickers*, and
*[shorts](shorts "wikilink")*) the word *breeches* has been applied to
both outer garments and [undergarments](undergarment "wikilink").
*Breeches* uses a plural form to reflect it has two legs; the word has
no singular form (it is a *[plurale
tantum](plurale_tantum "wikilink")*). This construction is common in
English and Italian (, plural of the never used ), but is no longer
common in some other languages in which it was once common; e.g., the
parallel modern .

At first *breeches* indicated a cloth worn as underwear by both men and
women. [Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of
Chesterfield](Philip_Stanhope,_4th_Earl_of_Chesterfield "wikilink"),
uses the word breech as a synonym or perhaps a euphemism for anus in his
letters.

In the latter 16th century, *breeches* began to replace
*[hose](Hose_(clothing) "wikilink")* (while the German , also a plural,
ousted as the general English term for men's lower outer garments, a
usage that remained standard until knee-length breeches were replaced
for everyday wear by long pantaloons or trousers. The difference was
that hose were in principle separate garments for each leg, requiring
the tunic or a [cod-piece](cod-piece "wikilink") to cover the private
parts; whereas breeches were sewn together as a single all-enveloping
garment.

Until around the end of the 19th century (but later in some places),
small boys wore special forms of [dresses](dress "wikilink") until they
were "[breeched](breeching_(boys) "wikilink")", or given the adult male
styles of clothes, at about the age of 6 to 8 (the age fell slowly to
perhaps 3). Male and female children's styles were distinguished by
chest and collar, as well as other aspects of attire, such as hairstyle.

During the [French Revolution](French_Revolution "wikilink"), breeches (
in French) were seen as a symbol of the nobility. Lower-class
revolutionaries became known as ("without breeches").

### Britches

The spelling *britches* is a spelling variant, not a
[corruption](corruption_(linguistics) "wikilink"), dating from the 17th
century. Presently, *britches* reflects a common pronunciation often
used in casual speech to mean [trousers](trousers "wikilink") or pants
in many English-speaking parts of the world. *Breeks* is a
[Scots](Scots_language "wikilink") or northern English spelling and
pronunciation.

### Breech

The singular form of the word has survived in the sense of the part of
the body covered by breeches, (i.e., posterior,
[buttocks](buttocks "wikilink")); paradoxically, the alliterating
expression "bare breech" thus means without any inner or outer
breeches.[2]

This also led to the following words:

-   a (gun) breech is the part of a firearm behind the bore (known since
    1575 in gunnery).[3]
-   [breech birth](breech_birth "wikilink") in childbirthing (since
    1673).

## Types

![](Knee_Breches_buckles.jpg "Knee_Breches_buckles.jpg")

The terms *breeches* or ***knee-breeches*** specifically designate the
knee-length garments worn by men from the later 16th century to the
early 19th century. After that, they survived in England only in very
formal wear, such as the [livery](livery "wikilink") worn by some
servants into the early 20th century, and the court dress worn by
others, such as [Queen's Counsel](Queen's_Counsel "wikilink"), down to
the present day on formal occasions.

-   [Spanish breeches](Spanish_breeches "wikilink"), stiff, ungathered
    breeches popular from the 1630s until the 1650s.

-   [Petticoat breeches](Petticoat_breeches "wikilink"), very full,
    ungathered breeches popular from the 1650s until the early 1660s,
    giving the impression of a woman's
    [petticoat](petticoat "wikilink").

-   [Rhinegraves](Rhinegraves "wikilink"), full, gathered breeches
    popular from the early 1660s until the mid-1670s, often worn with an
    overskirt over them.

-   *Fall front* breeches, breeches with a panel or flap covering the
    front opening and fastened up with buttons at either corner.

-   *Dress breeches* are tight fitting and have buttons and a strap and
    buckle (which are detachable) closure at the bottoms, made of velvet
    or [barathea](barathea "wikilink") wool, used for livery, formal and
    court dress.

-   From the 1890s to the 1930s a form of breeches called
    [knickerbockers](knickerbockers_(clothing) "wikilink") or knickers
    (US) were in fashion with both men and boys. Like their 18th century
    predecessor, they reached and were fastened just below the knees,
    but the thighs were more loosely worn. There were various versions
    including "[plus fours](plus_fours "wikilink")" for golf wear which
    reached down a further four inches below the knees, or "plus twos"
    that reached down only two inches, often used as apparel for the
    sport of bird-shooting, especially in Britain.

-   () are the traditional breeches of the islands of
    [Greece](Greece "wikilink") from the westernmost [Ionian
    Islands](Ionian_Islands "wikilink") to the easternmost,
    [Cyprus](Cyprus "wikilink"), as well as coasts of South mainland.
    Greek breeches are extremely roomy and are meant to be tucked inside
    long boots just below the knee. They were originally meant to
    facilitate movement on fishing boats and sailing ships. They are
    usually accompanied by a long, wide piece of cloth turned many times
    around the natural waist as a belt. As the lacks pockets, items
    (such as money) are stored inside the folds of this belt. are
    usually made of sturdy cotton [double
    cloth](double_cloth "wikilink"), usually dark blue or black, with
    brighter color cloth used as the belt. They were usually worn with
    white, long-sleeved shirts and a roomy waistcoat.

Note: In Cyprus, the vráka was originally made of white material which
was then sent to a dyer(known as a boyadjís\|πογιατζιής in Cypriot) to
change the colour from white to either black, light blue or dark blue.
In contrast to its present-day use, black coloured vrákes in Cyprus were
worn as a formal dress in events such as weddings or for going to church
on Sunday whereas the everyday vráka that Cypriot men wore was thin blue
or white vrákes, in the summer and thicker dark blue(similar to the
Cretan blue vráka) vrákes, in the winter. In the hills, Cypriot men wore
shorter vrákes in order to make their work easier and wore
frangopodínes(φραγκοποδίνες) which are boots that reach the knee. In
large cities of Cyprus, the vráka was always black.[4]

-   Breeches are still worn by many
    [Hasidic](Hasidic_Judaism "wikilink") men, particularly those of
    [Galician](Galicia_(Eastern_Europe) "wikilink") or
    [Hungarian](Hungary "wikilink")
    [origin](List_of_Hasidic_dynasties "wikilink"), such as
    [Satmar](Satmar_(Hasidic_dynasty) "wikilink") and
    [Sanz](Sanz "wikilink")
-   In the 18th and 19th centuries, the term *breech-cloth* or
    *breech-clout* was also used to describe the apron-like
    [loincloths](loincloth "wikilink") worn by some [Indigenous peoples
    of the Americas](Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "wikilink").
-   In the [Book of Exodus](Book_of_Exodus "wikilink"), the
    [kohanim](kohanim "wikilink") (priests) were commanded to wear white
    linen breeches, the [priestly
    undergarments](priestly_undergarments "wikilink").

### Riding breeches

![](Henry_Duke_of_Cumberland_by_David_Morier_1765.jpg "fig:Henry_Duke_of_Cumberland_by_David_Morier_1765.jpg")
by [David Morier](David_Morier "wikilink") around 1765.\]\] Riding
breeches are specifically designed for
[equestrian](equestrianism "wikilink") activities. Traditionally, they
were tight in the legs, stopping about halfway down the calf, with
buckles or laces in the calf section, and had a pronounced flare through
the thighs that allowed freedom of movement for the rider. Before the
invention of the fly front, they were made with flaps, 5-8 inches wide,
called *falls*. They were worn with [evening
dress](wikt:Special:Search/evening_dress "wikilink") until the 1810s,
with tailcoats during the day until the 1830s, and still later with
[Court
dress](Court_uniform_and_dress_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink").[5]

However, with the advent of modern stretch materials such as
[spandex](spandex "wikilink"), modern breeches have no flare and fit
skin-tight. Zippers and velcro fastenings have replaced laces and
buckles at the calves as well. The flared style is seen at times, and is
available to [cavalry](cavalry "wikilink") and other historic
[reenactors](historic_reenactment "wikilink").

There are four main types of riding breeches:

Knee-patch breeches
Breeches that stop mid-calf, designed to be worn with [tall
boots](riding_boot "wikilink"), which come up to the knee, or with [half
chaps](chaps "wikilink") and short [paddock
boots](riding_boot "wikilink"). They have grippy material, usually
leather or a "grippy" synthetic, only on the inside of the knee area.
These are the only type of breeches worn by [hunt
seat](hunt_seat "wikilink") riders. [Show
jumpers](Show_jumping "wikilink"), [eventers](eventer "wikilink"), [show
hunters](show_hunter "wikilink"), as well as some [endurance
riders](endurance_riding "wikilink"), and pleasure riders also often use
the breeches.[6]

Full seat breeches
Breeches with grippy material from the knee, up the inner thigh, and
across the buttocks. These breeches are primarily seen in
[dressage](dressage "wikilink") competition, where the "sticky" seat
helps riders stay quiet and deep in the saddle as they sit the
[gaits](horse_gait "wikilink") of their [horses](horse "wikilink").
However, they are also worn by [eventers](eventer "wikilink") and other
riders. They are designed to be worn with [tall
boots](riding_boot "wikilink") or [half chaps](chaps "wikilink").[7]

Jockeys' breeches
Also known as *silks*, jockeys' breeches are made from a white
lightweight fabric, usually [nylon](nylon "wikilink") and typically have
elasticised lower legs. Some racing authorities have regulations that
require a jockey's name to be inscribed along the thigh of the breeches.

Jodhpur breeches

![](Horse_riding_in_coca_cola_arena_-_melbourne_show_2005.jpg "fig:Horse_riding_in_coca_cola_arena_-_melbourne_show_2005.jpg").\]\]


These breeches, which are also called [jodhpurs](jodhpurs "wikilink"),
are a type of riding pants with legs extending to the ankles, where they
end in a small cuff that fits over the top of a low riding boot. They
are commonly placed in a separate category from other types of breeches
due to their additional length. They are most often worn by children.
However, they are worn by adults in the show ring in the United Kingdom
and Australia, and in the United States are seen on adults during riding
lessons and for casual riding. These riding pants have elastic straps or
"stirrups" that run under the rider's boots, and are usually worn with
garters, to prevent them from riding up. They are meant to be worn with
[jodhpur boots](jodhpur_boot "wikilink"), also known as "paddock boots",
which come up just above the ankles. The advantage of jodhpurs is that
expensive high [riding boots](riding_boot "wikilink") are not required
to protect the calf of the leg from rubbing against the horse's flank or
the stirrup leathers.[8]

Kentucky jodhpurs
Kentucky jodhpurs are full-length riding pants used exclusively in
[saddle seat](saddle_seat "wikilink") style riding. Like hunt seat
jodhpurs, they are close-fitting from waist to ankle, but differ in that
they are much longer, ending with a flared bell bottom that fits over
the jodhpur boot, usually extending longer than the heel of the boot in
back, and covering the arch of the foot (but not the toe) in front. The
overall look gives the impression of a rider with a long leg, a desired
[equitation](equitation "wikilink") standard. Like the hunt seat
jodhpur, they have elastic straps that run under the boot to help hold
the pant leg in place.[9]

Color is important in selecting breeches for competition. Sanctioning
organizations and tradition both dictate that show clothing is to be
quiet, classic and conservative in design. White is common in
[dressage](dressage "wikilink"), and is also seen in [show
jumping](show_jumping "wikilink"). Beige is seen in most [hunt
seat](hunt_seat "wikilink")-style equestrian disciplines, though light
grays, "canary" (a dull yellow), rust, tan, and an olive-greenish colour
are periodically popular with hunt seat competitors.
[Eventers](Eventing "wikilink") wear classic colours for the dressage
and stadium phase, but less classic colours may be seen on the
cross-country course (especially at the lower levels) to match the
"stable colours" of the rider. [Saddle seat](Saddle_seat "wikilink")
riders, whose riding clothing styles derived from men's business suits,
wear Kentucky jodhpurs in dark colors, usually black, navy blue, or a
shade that matches the riding coat.[10]

Breeches may be front or side zip. Some competitors believe the side-zip
to give a cleaner appearance and to be more flattering. Styles are also
developing to parallel trends in street clothing, including low-rise
breeches and brightly colored and patterned breeches & jodhpurs that are
aimed primarily at children.

Riding breeches were formerly made of thick
cavalry-[twill](twill "wikilink") and had flared thighs (balloon legs),
until the invention and use of multi-stretch fabrics like
[Nylon](Nylon "wikilink") and [Spandex](Spandex "wikilink") became
widespread for riding in the 1960s. The balloon legs were there to
accommodate the riders knees as they sat in the saddle, but fabrics that
stretched in all four directions made such excess material unnecessary
and the form-fitting and much thinner modern breeches and jodhpurs
became normal.

### Fencing breeches

**Fencing breeches** are worn in the sport of
[fencing](fencing "wikilink") to permit fencers to extend their legs
more than they could wearing normal jogging trousers or tracksuit
bottoms. Fencing breeches are also used as [protective
clothing](protective_clothing "wikilink") for the legs.
