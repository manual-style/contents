**Capri pants** (also known as **three quarter legs**, **capris**,
**crop pants**, **man-pris**, **clam-diggers**,[1] **flood pants**,
**jams**, **highwaters**, or **toreador pants**[2]) are pants that are
longer than [shorts](shorts "wikilink") but are not as long as
[trousers](trousers "wikilink"). They typically come down to between
[knee](knee "wikilink") and [calf](Calf_(leg) "wikilink") or
[ankle](ankle "wikilink") length.

## History

Capri pants were introduced by fashion designer [Sonja de
Lennart](Sonja_de_Lennart "wikilink") in 1948, and were also popularised
by English couturier [Bunny Roger](Bunny_Roger "wikilink").[3] The name
of the pants is derived from the Italian isle of
[Capri](Capri "wikilink"), where they rose to popularity in the late
1950s and early '60s.[4] The actress [Audrey
Hepburn](Audrey_Hepburn "wikilink") was among the first movie stars who
wore capris, most notably in the film *[Roman
Holiday](Roman_Holiday "wikilink")*, and the pants quickly became
synonymous with her classic style.

## Popularity

Capris' acceptance in the United States was influenced by the 1960s
television series *[The Dick Van Dyke
Show](The_Dick_Van_Dyke_Show "wikilink")*. The character Laura Petrie,
the young housewife played by [Mary Tyler
Moore](Mary_Tyler_Moore "wikilink"), caused a fashion sensation – and
some mild controversy – by wearing snug-fitting capri pants during the
show's run.[5] By the mid 1960s, capri-style tight-fitting [cargo
pants](cargo_pants "wikilink") became popular among teenage boys; a good
example was the superstar teen actor of that era, [Luke
Halpin](Luke_Halpin "wikilink"), who wore them in some episodes of the
popular *[Flipper](Flipper_(1964_TV_series) "wikilink")*. After a drop
in popularity during the 1970s through the 1990s, capris returned to
favor in the mid 2000s.[6] Spanish tennis player [Rafael
Nadal](Rafael_Nadal "wikilink") wore capri pants in the majority of his
matches [before
2009](Rafael_Nadal#Equipment_and_endorsements "wikilink").[7] The
[Thirteenth Doctor](Thirteenth_Doctor "wikilink") from [Doctor
Who](Doctor_Who "wikilink") wore capri pants.
