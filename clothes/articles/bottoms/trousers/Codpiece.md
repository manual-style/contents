oil on oak painting by [Pieter Brueghel the
Younger](Pieter_Brueghel_the_Younger "wikilink")\]\] A **codpiece**
(from , meaning "[scrotum](scrotum "wikilink")") is a covering flap or
pouch that attaches to the front of the crotch of men's
[trousers](trousers "wikilink"), enclosing the
[genital](genital "wikilink") area. It may be held closed by string
ties, buttons, folds, or other methods. It was an important fashion item
of [European](Europe "wikilink") [clothing](clothing "wikilink") during
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. In the modern era, clothing
devices with similar functions as codpieces are worn in some styles of
[underwear](underwear "wikilink"), in the [leather
subculture](leather_subculture "wikilink"), and in performance costumes,
such as for rock music and metal musicians. A similar device with rigid
construction, an [athletic cup](athletic_cup "wikilink"), is used as
protective underwear for male athletes.

## In European fashion

From the ancient world there are extant depictions of articles of
clothing designed to cover just the male genitalia; for example,
archaeological recovery at [Minoan](Minoan_civilization "wikilink")
[Knossos](Knossos "wikilink") on [Crete](Crete "wikilink") has yielded
[figurines](figurine "wikilink"), some of whom wear only a garment
covering the male genitalia.[1] However, the *codpiece*, per se,
appeared in everyday European fashion for men only many centuries later,
associated with hose and trousers.

![](Tizian_025_detail.jpg "fig:Tizian_025_detail.jpg")
![](Tizian_081.jpg "fig:Tizian_081.jpg") In fourteenth century European
fashions, men's [hose](Hose_(clothing) "wikilink") were two separate
legs worn over linen [drawers](Undergarment "wikilink"), leaving a man's
genitals covered only by a layer of the linen drawers. As the century
wore on and men's [hemline](hemline "wikilink") fashion rose, the hose
became longer and joined at the centre back, there rising to the waist,
but remaining open at the centre front. Further shortening of the cote
or [doublet](doublet_(clothing) "wikilink") fashion resulted in more
prominence of the genitals, so the codpiece began life as a triangular
piece of fabric covering the gap to disguise that. Most of what is known
about the cut, fit, and materials used for Renaissance codpieces is
through portraits, clothing inventories, receipts for payments and
tailor cutting guides.[2]

Art](Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art "wikilink")\]\] ![Metal codpieces,
sixteenth century[3]
](Cod-Piece_by_Wendelin_Boeheim.jpg "fig:Metal codpieces, sixteenth century ")
As time passed, codpieces became shaped and padded to emphasize rather
than to conceal, mostly the [penis](penis "wikilink"). It even became
fashionable to design the codpiece to hold the penis in a position that
insinuated that it was erect constantly.

Such excessive codpieces became an object of derision showered on
outlandish fashions. The [Renaissance](Renaissance "wikilink") author,
[François Rabelais](François_Rabelais "wikilink"), refers satirically to
a book entitled *On the Dignity of Codpieces*, in the foreword to his
1532 book, *The Histories of [Gargantua and
Pantagruel](Gargantua_and_Pantagruel "wikilink")*.[4]

This fashion reached its peak of size and decoration in the 1540s before
falling out of use by the 1590s.

Suits of [armor](Armour "wikilink") of the sixteenth century followed
civilian fashion, and for a time, codpieces were a prominent addition to
the best full suits.

A few examples of full suits of armor with codpieces are on display in
museums today. The [Metropolitan Museum of
Art](Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art "wikilink") in [New York
City](New_York_City "wikilink") has one. The Higgins Armory[5] in
[Worcester, Massachusetts](Worcester,_Massachusetts "wikilink") also had
an example on display until its close. The armor of [Henry
VIII](Henry_VIII_of_England "wikilink") displayed in the [Tower of
London](Tower_of_London "wikilink") has a codpiece as well.[6]

Examples of metal parts of such armor, seen here, are depicted by
[Wendelin Boeheim](Wendelin_Boeheim "wikilink") in his 1890 publication
on the history of weapons, *Handbuch der Waffenkunde*, which was
published in Leipzig, Germany.[7]

## Derivatives in contemporary costumes

### Subcultural attire

A [jock strap](jock_strap "wikilink") is another protective article of
clothing that resembles a codpiece. Imitations of them made of leather
may be worn in [leather subcultural](leather_subculture "wikilink")
attire to cover and confine the genitals of a man, sometimes while
wearing leather [chaps](chaps "wikilink"). Rather than accentuating the
male genitalia through exaggeration of the size of the wearer's penis
and testicles, attention may be drawn to the genital area through
decorative adornment such as metallic studs in such articles of
clothing.

### Heavy metal fashion

![](Oderus-urungus-04.jpg "fig:Oderus-urungus-04.jpg") on stage in 2004
\|alt=\]\] This type of clothing crossed over from the [leather
subculture](leather_subculture "wikilink") to become an established part
of [heavy metal fashion](heavy_metal_fashion "wikilink") performance
[costume](costume "wikilink") when [Rob
Halford](Rob_Halford "wikilink"), of the band [Judas
Priest](Judas_Priest "wikilink"), began wearing clothing adopted from
the gay biker and [leather subculture](leather_subculture "wikilink")
while promoting the *[Killing Machine](Killing_Machine "wikilink")*
([AKA](wikt:AKA "wikilink") *Hell Bent for Leather*) album in 1978.[8]
[Heavy metal](Heavy_metal_music "wikilink") singer [King
Diamond](King_Diamond "wikilink") has been known to wear a similar
article of clothing as part of his performance outfits. [Black
metal](Black_metal "wikilink") musician and Satanist
[Infernus](Infernus "wikilink") wore this type of clothing as part of
his attire during the *[Ad Majorem Sathanas
Gloriam](Ad_Majorem_Sathanas_Gloriam "wikilink")* era of Gorgoroth.
[GWAR](GWAR "wikilink") frontman [Oderus
Urungus](Oderus_Urungus "wikilink") also wore something he called *The
Cuttlefish of Cthulhu*,[9] that resembles the crossover article.

### Pop music costumes

The [Cameo](Cameo_(band) "wikilink") front man [Larry
Blackmon](Larry_Blackmon "wikilink") sports such a crossover article of
clothing that became his trademark in his videos "[Word
Up](Word_Up!_(song) "wikilink")" and
"[Candy](Candy_(Cameo_song) "wikilink")". [Guns N'
Roses](Guns_N'_Roses "wikilink") front man [Axl
Rose](Axl_Rose "wikilink") wore one for most of the [Appetite for
Destruction Tour](Appetite_for_Destruction_Tour "wikilink"). [Jethro
Tull](Jethro_Tull_(band) "wikilink") front man Ian Anderson performed in
a similar article of clothing during the mid-1970s.

### High fashion forays

Derivatives occasionally make an appearance on the [haute
couture](haute_couture "wikilink") catwalk. [Jean Paul
Gaultier](Jean-Paul_Gaultier "wikilink"),[10] [Thom
Brown](Thom_Browne "wikilink") (2008,[11] 2012,[12] 2014[13]) and
[Versace](Versace "wikilink") (2014[14]) are designers who have used
similar designs to explore themes of masculinity and sexuality.
