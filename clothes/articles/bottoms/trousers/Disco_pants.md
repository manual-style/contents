## Disco Pants in the 1970s

### Background

1970s disco meant wearing clothing that could attract attention and
reflect the distinctive disco lighting. From hot pants to platform shoes
to polyester shirts and gold chains, the disco style was not appropriate
for everyday life. But come evening, disco dress for men and women alike
strove for a flashy, look-at-me style that would attract the spotlight
and stand out on the dance floor.

Women's clothing in the disco era was about looking good while being
able to move on the dance floor. Tight, restrictive skirts were seldom
seen, but glitzy dresses with free-flowing skirts or bright, satin hot
pants and sequinned tops were all the rage. Taking their inspiration
from dance wear, jumpsuits made out of Lycra or spandex accentuated a
woman's body while still allowing her to show off her dance
skills.![](Black_spandex_disco_pants.jpg "fig:Black_spandex_disco_pants.jpg")

### Disco pants

Disco pants origins has been contested. San Francisco in the late 1960s
is sourced by many fashion experts as the birthplace of Disco Pants.

They are form-fitting, high-waist unisex stretch pants made from a
heavyweight Nylon/Elastane blend that creates a flattering slimming
effect. They were made famous by [Olivia Newton
John](Olivia_Newton_John "wikilink") in 1970s movie
[Grease](Grease_(film) "wikilink") but could be seen worn by both males
and females during the period of the late 1970s through the mid 1980s.
Male music artists such as [Leif Garrett](Leif_Garrett "wikilink"),
[Shaun Cassidy](Shaun_Cassidy "wikilink"), the [Brothers
Johnson](Brothers_Johnson "wikilink"), [Menudo
(band)](Menudo_(band) "wikilink") and [John
Waite](John_Waite "wikilink") among others wore disco pants during
performances. Female music artists including [Dottie
West](Dottie_West "wikilink"), [The Nolans](The_Nolans "wikilink"),
[Tina Turner](Tina_Turner "wikilink"), [Kate
Bush](Kate_Bush "wikilink"), [The Mandrell
Sisters](The_Mandrell_Sisters "wikilink"), [Sheena
Easton](Sheena_Easton "wikilink"), [Yuri (Mexican
singer)](Yuri_(Mexican_singer) "wikilink"), [Christie
Allen](Christie_Allen "wikilink"), [Crystal
Gayle](Crystal_Gayle "wikilink") and many others could be seen sporting
the pants. Additionally, during this period many actors and actresses
could be seen wearing these pants in movies and television shows. [Solid
Gold (TV series)](Solid_Gold_(TV_series) "wikilink"), a weekly American
television show about hit music, regularly featured both male and female
dancers in disco pants.

The most widely known brands of disco pants from this era includes
[Frederick's of Hollywood](Frederick's_of_Hollywood "wikilink"), Le
Gambi, Bojeangles, Michi, Jonden, Tight End and Trousers Up. All brands
usually featured 2 back pockets, though 1 pocket versions were also
available but were less common. Additionally the pants featured a
button/buttonhole closure or snap button closure and a metal or plastic
zipper. Some models featured belt loops.

## Materials

A fabric made of or containing a [polyurethane](polyurethane "wikilink")
fiber with elastic properties form-fitting, high-waist stretch pants
made from a heavyweight stretchy material such as
[spandex](spandex "wikilink"), [polyester](polyester "wikilink") and
[Lycra](Lycra "wikilink") were the fabrics of choice during the disco
era. Because these fabrics could fit tightly and cling to the body,
clothing made of such material was very much in demand. Bold, dramatic
colors and wild, geometric patterns were all the rage. Shiny,
light-reflecting fabrics such as satin's and silks as well as gold
[lamé](lamé_(fabric) "wikilink") or sequin-encrusted garments could make
the perfect disco statement.

## 2007 revival

Pop celebrities such as [Jessie J](Jessie_J "wikilink") have started
wearing them again, progressing from the 1970s there might be coming out
with the jacket that go with the pants.[1]

In 2008, American clothing manufacturer [American
Apparel](American_Apparel "wikilink") reintroduced disco pants to the
buying public, albeit in a version slightly different from the original
from 30 years earlier. This new disco pant featured a super skinny fit
and are generally considered to be leggings, as they are form-fitting
from the waist all the way down to the hems. In all other respects, this
updated disco pant retained the characteristics of the originals,
including material content, rear pockets and button/zipper closure. The
revived disco pant as made by American Apparel deeply influenced
worldwide fashion circles and opened the market to many similar disco
pants as made by other manufacturers. Unlike the original version, these
new disco pants are strictly marketed to women and are worn mostly by
them.

As of 2014, the modern version of disco pants remains available for sale
and is still widely popular. Additionally, disco pants true to the
original straight-leg fit and unisex appeal are being newly made in a
revival of some of the original brand names.
