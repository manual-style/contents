**Dolphin shorts** or **Dolfins** are a specific style of unisex
[shorts](shorts "wikilink") for
[athletics](Athletics_(sport) "wikilink"). They are typically very short
and were originally made from nylon with contrasting binding, side
slits, and rounded corners, with a [waistband](waistband "wikilink") at
the topâ€”a style popular in the 1980s.[1][2]

The name is from [Dolfin](Dolfin_Swimwear "wikilink"), the American
company that first produced this style of shorts in the 1980s.[3] Due to
their shortness, they are sometimes identified as a form of
[hotpants](hotpants "wikilink").[4]

One high-profile wearer of 'dolphin shorts' is the fitness guru [Richard
Simmons](Richard_Simmons "wikilink"), who in 2012, boasted of owning 400
pairs of vintage Dolfins.[5]

Orange Dolfin shorts are specified as part of the uniform for waitresses
at [Hooters](Hooters "wikilink").[6][7]
