![](Reagan_hirohito.jpg "fig:Reagan_hirohito.jpg"), and [U.S.
President](U.S._President "wikilink") [Ronald
Reagan](Ronald_Reagan "wikilink") together with [Emperor
Hirohito](Emperor_Hirohito "wikilink") of [Japan](Japan "wikilink"),
both men in [morning coats](morning_coat "wikilink") with formal
trousers (known as [morning dress](morning_dress "wikilink"))
(1983).\]\] **Formal trousers**, also known as **formal striped
trousers** or [colloquially](colloquially "wikilink") *spongebag
trousers*, are grey striped or patterned
[formal](formal_attire "wikilink") trousers for [day
attire](Morning_dress "wikilink") in traditional [Western dress
code](Western_dress_code "wikilink"), primarily associated with formal
[morning dress](morning_dress "wikilink") or secondly its
[semi-formal](semi-formal_attire "wikilink") equivalent [black lounge
suit](stroller_(style) "wikilink").[1] Traditionally made from heavy
[wool](wool "wikilink") ranging from [worsted](worsted "wikilink"),
[melton](Melton_(cloth) "wikilink") to partial [twill](twill "wikilink")
weave, the pattern is most often of a muted design in stripes of black,
silver, white and charcoal grey in various combinations (not to be
confused with [pinstripe](pinstripe "wikilink") or
[chalkstripe](chalkstripe "wikilink"), which are formed of single thin
lines spaced equally apart). In addition, formal trousers may also come
in [check](check_(pattern) "wikilink") patterns, such as [houndstooth
check](houndstooth_check "wikilink"), or [plaids](plaids "wikilink"),
although these variants are widely considered not as the most formal.

Although it is possible to create a complete suit out of the same
fabric, [etiquette](etiquette "wikilink") limits the morning stripe
design to formal trouser.[2]

Typically, formal trousers are intended to be worn with
[braces](Braces_(clothing) "wikilink") with a fishtail back covered by a
[waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink"), and have [pleats](pleats "wikilink")
for correct [ironing](ironing "wikilink") result and comfort. Likewise,
for traditional reasons of formality, they do not have
[turn-ups](turn-ups "wikilink"), since these are considered less formal.

## Name

The British synonym "cashmere striped trousers" refers to the actual
name of the stripe pattern, and not to the [fabric](fabric "wikilink").
Similarly, the slang term "spongebag trousers" or "spongebags" is due to
the perceived similarity of the distinctive stripe pattern to
traditional sponge-bags, a bag of [toiletries](toiletries "wikilink")
(but does not apply to check patterns). In Germany, the synonym
"Stresemann trousers" occurs, for the same reasons as the
[semi-formal](semi-formal "wikilink")
[stroller](Stroller_(style) "wikilink") is called a "Stresemann".

## History

Formal trousers were originally introduced in the first half of the 19th
century as a complement to the then widely worn [frock
coat](frock_coat "wikilink"). As established formal day attire trousers,
they were subsequently introduced to go with the [morning
dress](morning_dress "wikilink"), which in turn gradually replaced the
frock coat as formal day attire standard by 20th century, along with its
semi-formal equivalent [black lounge suit](stroller_(style) "wikilink").
