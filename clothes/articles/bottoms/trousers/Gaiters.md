**Gaiters** are garments worn over the shoe and lower
[pants](Trousers "wikilink") leg, and used primarily as [personal
protective equipment](personal_protective_equipment "wikilink"); similar
garments used primarily for display are
[spats](Spat_(footwear) "wikilink"). Originally, gaiters were made of
[leather](leather "wikilink"). Today, gaiters for
[walking](walking "wikilink") are commonly made of plasticized synthetic
cloth such as [polyester](polyester "wikilink"). Gaiters for use on
horseback continue to be made of leather.

## Terminology

In army parlance, a gaiter covers leg and bootlacing; a legging covers
only the leg. In [RAF](RAF "wikilink") parlance, gaiter includes
legging. The [American Army](National_Army_(USA) "wikilink") during
[World War I](World_War_I "wikilink")[1] and [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink") had leggings, which were gaiters. Above the
knee spatterdashes were cotton or canvas, as were many gaiters of
varying lengths thereafter. Leather gaiters were rare in military,
though sometimes a calf-length [cotton](cotton "wikilink") gaiter had
leather kneecaps added. Leggings, however, were very often made of
leather, but also [canvas](canvas "wikilink").

[Ceremonial Guard](honor_guard#United_States "wikilink") wearing white
canvas [leggings](leggings#Military_use "wikilink"), as the part of the
[Enlisted Full Dress Whites or
Blue](Uniforms_of_the_United_States_Navy "wikilink")\]\]

Gaiters are a type of protective clothing for a person's
[ankles](ankle "wikilink") and legs below the knee. Gaiters are worn
when [walking](walking "wikilink"), [hiking](hiking "wikilink"),
[running](running "wikilink") (especially
[orienteering](orienteering "wikilink") and
[rogaining](rogaining "wikilink")) outdoors amongst dense underbrush or
in [snow](snow "wikilink"), with or without
[snowshoes](snowshoe "wikilink"). Heavy gaiters are often worn when
using [crampons](crampon "wikilink"), to protect the leg and ankle from
the spikes of the opposite foot. Gaiters strap over the [hiking
boot](hiking_boot "wikilink") and around the person's leg to provide
protection from branches and thorns and to prevent mud, snow, etc. from
entering the top of the boot. Gaiters may also be worn as protection
against snake bites.[2]

Gaiters fill the same function as [puttees](puttee "wikilink"), a part
of numerous military uniforms. Gaiters known as *jambieres* (derived
from the French word *jambe* for legs, hence leggings) were part of the
uniform of [Zouave](Zouave "wikilink") infantry regiments.

## On horseback

![](Huaso-leg.jpg "Huaso-leg.jpg")

During the 19th century gaiters for riding typically were known as
*riding gaiters*, distinguishing them from the other gaiters that were
in general use. Today, [half chaps](Chaps#Half_chaps "wikilink") are a
type of gaiter worn by [equestrians](Equestrianism "wikilink"). Most
forms fit over the calf. These are intended to protect the rider's leg
from wear by the stirrup leathers and other saddle parts. Modern styles
usually have a zipper or [hook and loop
fasteners](hook_and_loop_fastener "wikilink") on the outside of the leg.

## In the Anglican church

Gaiters formed a part of the everyday [clerical
clothing](clerical_clothing "wikilink") of [bishops](bishop "wikilink")
and [archdeacons](archdeacon "wikilink") of the [Church of
England](Church_of_England "wikilink") until the middle part of the
twentieth century. They were also worn by some cathedral
[deans](Dean_(Christianity) "wikilink"). They were made of black cotton,
wool, or silk, and buttoned up the sides, reaching to just below the
knee where they would join with black breeches. Gaiters would be worn
with a clerical [apron](apron "wikilink"), a type of short
[cassock](cassock "wikilink") reaching to just above the knee. The
purpose of this vesture was originally practical, since archdeacons and
bishops were presumed to be mobile, riding horses to various parts of a
[diocese](diocese "wikilink") or archdeaconry. In latter years, the
clothing took on a more symbolic dimension.[3]
