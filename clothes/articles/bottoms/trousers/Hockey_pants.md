**Hockey pants** are knee-to-waist protective gear for [ice
hockey](ice_hockey "wikilink") or [roller
hockey](roller_hockey "wikilink") players. The pants carry a variety of
[padding](padding "wikilink") depending on whether they are worn by
[goaltenders](goaltender "wikilink") or skaters
([forwards](forward_(hockey) "wikilink") and
[defenders](defenceman_(ice_hockey) "wikilink")), and also on the
manufacturer.

The pants are traditionally a one-piece garment with a
[lace](lace "wikilink")-up fly augmented by a strap
[belt](belt_(clothing) "wikilink"). Sometimes, they are additionally
held up by [suspenders](suspenders "wikilink") (particularly in the case
of goalie pants).

Hockey pants are also called "breezers" in [North
Dakota](North_Dakota "wikilink"), [Minnesota](Minnesota "wikilink") and
[Wisconsin](Wisconsin "wikilink").[1]
