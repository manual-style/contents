**Hotpants** or **hot pants** describe extremely short
[shorts](shorts "wikilink"). The term was first used by *[Women's Wear
Daily](Women's_Wear_Daily "wikilink")* in 1970 to describe shorts made
in luxury fabrics such as velvet and satin for fashionable wear, rather
than their more practical equivalents that had been worn for sports or
leisure since the 1930s. The term has since become a generic term for
any pair of extremely short shorts. While hotpants were briefly a very
popular element of mainstream fashion in the early 1970s, by the
mid-1970s, they had become associated with the [sex
industry](sex_industry "wikilink"), which contributed to their fall from
fashion. However, hotpants continue to be popular as
[clubwear](clubwear "wikilink") well into the 2010s and are often worn
within the entertainment industry, particularly as part of
[cheerleader](cheerleader "wikilink") costumes or for dancers
(especially [backup dancers](backup_dancer "wikilink")). Performers such
as [Britney Spears](Britney_Spears "wikilink") and [Kylie
Minogue](Kylie_Minogue "wikilink") have famously worn hotpants as part
of their public performances and presentation.

## Origins and terminology

Whilst the term "hotpants" is used generically to describe extremely
short shorts,[1] similar garments had been worn since the 1930s.[2]
These garments, however, were designed mainly for sports, beachwear and
leisure wear, while hotpants were innovative in that they were made from
non-activewear fabrics such as velvet, silk, crochet, fur and leather,
and styled explicitly to be worn on the street, for parties, or even as
bridal wear.[3][4][5] Dorothy Tricario, a fashion curator at the
[Brooklyn Museum](Brooklyn_Museum "wikilink") told *[The New York
Times](The_New_York_Times "wikilink")* in 1971 that hotpants were part
of a greater nostalgic revival of 1930s and 1940s fashion, specifically
the short posing shorts worn by Hollywood stars like [Ruby
Keeler](Ruby_Keeler "wikilink"), [Deanna
Durbin](Deanna_Durbin "wikilink"), and [Betty
Grable](Betty_Grable "wikilink").[6] However, Tricario also observed
that shorts had never before had such widespread acceptance as street or
business wear as they did in early 1971.[7]

According to the fashion publicist [Eleanor
Lambert](Eleanor_Lambert "wikilink"), the term "hot pants" was coined by
*[Women's Wear Daily](Women's_Wear_Daily "wikilink")* (*WWD*) in 1970 to
describe fashions innovated by the French ready-to-wear company
[Dorothée Bis](Dorothée_Bis "wikilink").[8] The *WWD* claim to have
originated the term is also backed up by 1971 articles in *[The New York
Times](The_New_York_Times "wikilink")* and the African-American magazine
*[Jet](Jet_(magazine) "wikilink")*.[9][10] *Jet*{{'}}s fashion editor,
Audrey Smaltz, suggested that because hotpants were best suited to Black
women, they should be called "Knockout Shorts" as that name was more
"relevant to Blacks", expressing the fashionable African-American Black
woman's pride in her "knockout body" as well as paying tribute to Black
identity and [recent struggles](Civil_Rights_Movement "wikilink").[11]
Other alternative names included "les shorts", "short cuts", "cool
pants", and "shortootsies", with "booty shorts" as an early 21st-century
term.[12] Today, the term hotpants can be used for
[casual](casual_attire "wikilink") as well as fashion-wear short-shorts
made in any fabric, or worn by any gender.[13][14]

While hotpants were principally marketed to women, men were also
targeted, and the term can describe very short men's
shorts.[15][16][17][18]

## Reception

![](Early_1970s_red_hot_pants_and_knee_boots.jpg "Early_1970s_red_hot_pants_and_knee_boots.jpg")

At the end of the 1960s, the fashion industry had tried unsuccessfully
to promote the mid-calf-length or midi skirt as a fashionable
replacement for the [miniskirt](miniskirt "wikilink").[19][20] In
contrast to the lukewarm response to the midi, shoppers enthusiastically
embraced the idea of short shorts, which were made available at all
price levels from haute couture to inexpensive ready-to-wear.[21]
Lambert credits [Mariuccia Mandelli](Mariuccia_Mandelli "wikilink") of
the Italian fashion label [Krizia](Krizia "wikilink") with designing the
first "hot pants" in 1970.[22] Hotpants are also increasingly credited
to [Mary Quant](Mary_Quant "wikilink"), who reportedly offered them in
the late 1960s.[23][24][25][26] Many designers from across the Western
world produced their own versions of hotpants at all price levels,
including [Yves Saint
Laurent](Yves_Saint_Laurent_(designer) "wikilink"),
[Valentino](Valentino_(fashion_designer) "wikilink"),
[Halston](Halston "wikilink"), and [Betsey
Johnson](Betsey_Johnson "wikilink").[27] Mass-produced versions were
also sold through the [Sears](Sears "wikilink") mail-order
catalogue.[28]

Hotpants were available for women, men and children, although they were
principally worn by women.[29] [Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis](Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis "wikilink") bought a pair for wear
while yachting,[30] while other high-profile wearers included [Elizabeth
Taylor](Elizabeth_Taylor "wikilink"), [Raquel
Welch](Raquel_Welch "wikilink"), and [Jane
Fonda](Jane_Fonda "wikilink").[31] Hotpants were also worn by
particularly adventurous men such as [David
Bowie](David_Bowie "wikilink"), [Sammy Davis
Jr.](Sammy_Davis_Jr. "wikilink") and
[Liberace](Liberace "wikilink").[32] Hotpants for men were slightly
longer than the women's versions, although they were still shorter than
usual.[33]

The [James Brown](James_Brown "wikilink") song "[Hot Pants (She Got to
Use What She Got to Get What She
Wants)](Hot_Pants_(James_Brown_song) "wikilink")", released in August
1971, was, according to his trombonist [Fred
Wesley](Fred_Wesley "wikilink"), inspired by the sight of women of all
colours wearing hotpants in a wide range of materials in the Black and
White Club, Brussels.[34]

The historian [Valerie Steele](Valerie_Steele "wikilink") noted that
hotpants, both as a name, and as a garment, quickly became associated
with sexuality and [prostitution](prostitution "wikilink") due to their
popularity with [male spectators](male_gaze "wikilink").[35][36] In
January 1971, a Manhattan-based male psychiatrist suggested that the
popularity of hotpants lay in how they expressed a "female's new
freedom", borrowing his phrasing from the [women's liberation
movement](women's_liberation_movement "wikilink"),[37] but then went on
to suggest that the wearer of hotpants wanted to relate to other people
by drawing attention through "sexually provocative" dressing as a
"prelude to a genuine relationship".[38] By the mid-1970s, extremely
short shorts had become shorthand for prostitution, particularly
underage prostitution, as exemplified by the 1976 film *[Taxi
Driver](Taxi_Driver "wikilink")*, in which [Jodie
Foster](Jodie_Foster "wikilink")'s child-prostitute character was
dressed in a pair of hotpants.[39] Such associations contributed to
hotpants becoming unattractive as a part of a woman's everyday wardrobe,
although they remained popular wear in entertainment, party-wear and
some evening contexts.[40] The controversial associations with hotpants
were still an issue in 1999, when [Britney
Spears](Britney_Spears "wikilink") posed for a photoshoot in *[Rolling
Stone](Rolling_Stone "wikilink")* wearing a pink pair.[41] The
photographs, taken by [David LaChapelle](David_LaChapelle "wikilink"),
presented Spears in provocative poses, surrounded by dolls and
tricycles, with the word "Baby" [rhinestoned](rhinestone "wikilink")
across the seat of her hotpants, and led to widespread media debate and
public commentary about whether it was appropriate for role models for
young girls to present themselves in such a "highly sexualised"
manner.[42]

In 2000, [Kylie Minogue](Kylie_Minogue "wikilink") notably wore a pair
of gold [lamé](lamé_(fabric) "wikilink") hotpants in her music video for
[Spinning Around](Spinning_Around "wikilink"), which led to widespread
media focus on the garment and the singer's body within.[43][44] The
hotpants were eventually donated by Minogue to the [Performing Arts
Collection](Performing_Arts_Collection "wikilink") museum at the [Arts
Centre, Melbourne](Arts_Centre_Melbourne "wikilink"), where they are
described as "one of the most identifiable items of contemporary popular
culture."[45]

Hotpants, also called booty shorts continue being popular well into the
2010s, and are often seen in particular contexts such as
[Miami](Miami "wikilink")'s [South Beach](South_Beach "wikilink") and
[Venice Beach](Venice,_Los_Angeles "wikilink"), [Los
Angeles](Los_Angeles "wikilink"), whose beach-to-bar environments have
unique dress codes.[46]

## In uniforms

Hotpants can also be part of a uniform worn by cheerleaders and
performers, or required wear in certain service industries.[47]
[Southwest Airlines](Southwest_Airlines "wikilink") became notorious for
the hotpants uniform they supplied for their
[stewardesses](Flight_attendant "wikilink") (nicknamed "Love Birds") in
1971, as featured in an ad campaign with the slogan "Someone Else Up
There Who Loves You."[48] The tangerine-coloured uniforms (designed by
Juanice Gunn Muse, the wife of M. Lamar Muse, the Southwest Airlines
president) were worn by girls who were chosen for their good looks and
friendliness.[49] Lamar Muse boasted that having beautiful attendants in
hotpants ensured that male passengers would fight to sit on the aisle
rather than by the window.[50] However, [feminist](feminist "wikilink")
organisations such as Stewardesses for [Women's
Rights](Women's_Rights "wikilink") protested and lobbied against such
indignities.[51] Also in 1971, the [Hot Pants
Patrol](Hot_Pants_Patrol "wikilink") was introduced as an elite corps of
female [ushers](usher_(occupation) "wikilink") for the [Philadelphia
Phillies](Philadelphia_Phillies "wikilink")
[baseball](baseball "wikilink") team, with the intention of attracting
greater audiences for the games.[52] While the majority of "Fillies"
wore white [microskirts](microskirt "wikilink") as part of their
uniform, the 36 members of the Hot Pants Patrol wore a red hotpants
[jumpsuit](jumpsuit "wikilink") with white vinyl [go-go
boots](go-go_boot "wikilink").[53] After pressure from feminist
organisations, the Phillies retired the Hot Pants Patrol in 1982.[54]

Hotpants or booty shorts remain a popular costume for cheerleaders and
dancers, particularly [hip hop](hip_hop "wikilink") performers, and are
frequently worn by [backup dancers](backup_dancer "wikilink").[55][56]
The uniform of the [Dallas Cowboys
Cheerleaders](Dallas_Cowboys_Cheerleaders "wikilink") consists of
hotpants and [midriff tops](crop_top "wikilink").[57] In the early 21st
century hotpants continue to be part of certain service industry
uniforms, particularly where the wearers are likely to serve a
predominantly male clientele. One example of this is
[Hooters](Hooters "wikilink"), where the servers (or "Hooters Girls")
are expected to wear very brief orange [Dolphin
shorts](Dolphin_shorts "wikilink") along with a tight tank top,
[pantyhose](pantyhose "wikilink") and a [bra](bra "wikilink").[58]
