**Jeggings** are [leggings](leggings "wikilink") that are made to look
like skin-tight [denim](denim "wikilink") [jeans](jeans "wikilink").[1]
The word is a [portmanteau](portmanteau "wikilink") of the words jeans
and leggings.

## Wear

Jeggings were brought on by the resurgence in style of [skinny
jeans](skinny_jeans "wikilink") in the late 2000s, when a higher demand
for a tighter style of pants came about.[2] Since jeggings are typically
made of a cotton/[spandex](spandex "wikilink") blend, (cotton being the
primary fiber in most denim, a kind of
[serge](serge_(fabric) "wikilink")), they are often worn on their own as
opposed to under a skirt or dress. Some jeggings have front fastening
facilities while others just have an elastic waistband and no pockets.

With respect to material, Jeggings fall into two main categories:

1.  Jeggings that are legging material, i.e. a knit, made to look like
    denim with fake pockets and belt loops
2.  Jeggings that are a true cross between denim and legging material.
    "Denim jeggings" are essentially a denim fabric with the elasticity
    of a legging, due to a higher proportion of Spandex in the fiber
    content.

The latter are more similar to skinny jeans than the former. Some
designers call "denim jeggings" pull-on jeans rather than jeggings.[3]

## Fashion trend

Jeggings entered the fitness world in early 2010, and were among the
most popular clothing items of 2010, according to business reporting.
Many opt to wear jeggings in order to give the legging feel as well as
the jean appearance.[4]

## Popular culture

In 2011 "Jeggings" was entered into the twelfth edition of *[Concise
Oxford English
Dictionary](Concise_Oxford_English_Dictionary "wikilink")*.[5] [Conan
O'Brien](Conan_O'Brien "wikilink") wore a pair during the taping of
*[Conan](Conan_(talk_show) "wikilink")* on 2 December 2010, the night
after admitting his (tongue-in-cheek) love for jeggings to *[Project
Runway](Project_Runway "wikilink")*'s [Tim
Gunn](Tim_Gunn "wikilink").[6] Some people also say it can be translated
as "Dirty ING". The reason: "Jeg" means in Romanian "dirty" and "ING" is
a Belgian banc.
