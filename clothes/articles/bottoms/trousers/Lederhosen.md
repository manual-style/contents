**Lederhosen** (; , "leather breeches"; singular in German usage:
*Lederhose*) are short or knee-length [leather](leather "wikilink")
[breeches](breeches "wikilink") that are worn as [traditional
garments](folk_costume "wikilink") in German-speaking countries. The
longer ones are generally called *Bundhosen* or *Kniebundhosen*.[1] Once
common workwear across Central Europe, these clothes—or
[Tracht](Tracht "wikilink")—are particularly associated with
[Bavaria](Bavaria "wikilink") and the
[Tyrol](Tyrol–South_Tyrol–Trentino_Euroregion "wikilink") region.

## Traditional Bavarian men's clothing

Formerly, lederhosen were worn for hard physical work; they were more
durable than a fabric garment. Today, they are mostly worn as
[leisurewear](leisure "wikilink"). Today, lederhosen and
[dirndl](dirndl "wikilink") attire is common at
[Oktoberfest](Oktoberfest "wikilink") events around the world.

Lederhosen were once widespread among men of the
[Alpine](Alps "wikilink") and surrounding regions, including
[Bavaria](Bavaria "wikilink"), [Austria](Austria "wikilink"), the
[Allgäu](Allgäu "wikilink"), Switzerland, the autonomous Italian region
of [Trentino-Alto
Adige/Südtirol](Trentino-Alto_Adige/Südtirol "wikilink") (formerly part
of Austria-Hungary) and [Alpine](Alps "wikilink") area of todays
[Slovenia](Slovenia "wikilink"). But they were not usually worn in
southwestern Germany or Switzerland.

*La Couturière Parisienne*, however, claims that lederhosen were
originally not exclusively a Bavarian garment but were worn all over
Europe, especially by riders, hunters, and other people involved in
outdoor activities. The flap (*drop front*) may have been a unique
Bavarian invention. The drop-front style became so popular in the 18th
century that it was known in France as *à la bavaroise,* "in the
Bavarian style."[2]

![](Lederhosen.jpg "fig:Lederhosen.jpg") The popularity of lederhosen in
Bavaria dropped sharply in the 19th century. They began to be considered
as uncultured peasants' clothing that was not fitting for modern
city-dwellers. However, in the 1880s a resurgence set in, and several
clubs were founded in [Munich](Munich "wikilink") and other large cities
devoted to preserving traditional rural clothing styles. The conception
of lederhosen as a quintessentially Bavarian garment that is worn at
festive occasions rather than at work dates largely from this time.

Lederhosen have remained regionally popular and are popularly associated
with [virility](virility "wikilink") and brawn. Some men wear them when
gardening, hiking, working outdoors, or attending [folk
festivals](festival "wikilink") or [beer
gardens](Biergarten "wikilink"). They are a symbol of regional pride in
Bavaria and the other areas where they are worn, but are rarely seen
elsewhere.

Traditional lederhosen are hand made of tanned deer leather which makes
the pants soft and light but very tearproof. As those leather pants are
very valuable and can last a lifetime, some Bavarians even bequeath
their lederhosen to the next generation. Some variations of modern
lederhosen are made of heavier, lower quality leather, or imitations
like velour leather which make them much cheaper but less durable. All
variations are usually equipped with two side pockets, one hip pocket,
one knife pocket, and a codpiece (drop front). For an Oktoberfest
costume, people combine lederhosen with
[Haverlschuhe](Haferlschuh "wikilink"), stockings and a classic white or
checked shirt.[3]

## Traditional German boys' clothing

![](Lederhose.jpg "Lederhose.jpg")

German boys used to wear lederhosen up to the age of about sixteen
years. These lederhosen were not decorated with embroidery but had the
typical attributes of suspenders/braces and drop-front flap. Even today,
some German and French [Scouts](Scout_(Scouting) "wikilink") wear
various forms of lederhosen, although in most cases they are not part of
their official uniform.

Lederhosen were also worn by Austrian boys from the 1930s to the 1970s.
Today they are worn on special occasions, such as a
[Biergarten](Biergarten "wikilink") or [Zeltfest](Zeltfest "wikilink").
Girls wear the [Dirndl](Dirndl "wikilink"), which is part of Austrian
[Tracht](Tracht "wikilink").
