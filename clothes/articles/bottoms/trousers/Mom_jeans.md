**Mom jeans** is a slang term for high-waisted women's
[jeans](jeans "wikilink") that were originally fashionable in the late
1980s and early 1990s. In the late 1990s and 2000s they were mainly worn
by middle-aged American women and considered unhip by trendy younger
women.[1][2] Mom jeans then came back in style amongst
[hipsters](Hipster_(contemporary_subculture) "wikilink") and fashionably
aware young women in the 2010s.[3]

Originally a pejorative and derogatory term, mom jeans gained prominence
from a May 2003 *[Saturday Night Live](Saturday_Night_Live "wikilink")*
skit written by [Tina Fey](Tina_Fey "wikilink") for a fake brand of
jeans called Mom Jeans, which used the tagline "For this [Mother's
Day](Mother's_Day "wikilink"), don't give Mom that bottle of perfume.
Give her something that says, 'I'm not a woman anymore...I'm a mom!'
"[4]

## Characteristics

This style usually consists of a [high
waist](high_rise_(fashion) "wikilink") rising above the
[navel](navel "wikilink"), making the [buttocks](buttocks "wikilink")
appear disproportionately longer, larger, and flatter. Mom jeans have
excess space in the zipper, crotch and leg areas. The jeans are usually
in a solid, light-blue color, with no form of [stone
washing](stone_washing "wikilink") or fading.

Other attributes of the style often seen are [pleats](pleat "wikilink"),
tapered legs, and [elastic waistbands](elastic_waistband "wikilink").
The style is often accompanied by a blouse or shirt that is tucked into
the jeans. This style of jeans was popular with trendy young [women in
the United States](women_in_the_United_States "wikilink") until the mid
'90s, when lower rise jeans started to become fashionable.

Mom jeans came back into fashion in the
[2010s](2010s_fashion "wikilink").[5]

practices pitching wearing "dad jeans" in advance of throwing the
[ceremonial first pitch](ceremonial_first_pitch "wikilink") at the 2009
MLB All-Star Game \]\] A corresponding term, **dad jeans**, has been
coined in popular media to refer to an unflattering, high-waisted and
shapeless style of jeans often worn by
[middle-aged](middle-age "wikilink") American men. The term gained
popularity in 2009 when President [Barack
Obama](Barack_Obama "wikilink") wore dad jeans during the [2009 Major
League Baseball All-Star
Game](2009_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game "wikilink").[6][7][8][9]
In March 2015, Obama appeared on *[Jimmy Kimmel
Live!](Jimmy_Kimmel_Live! "wikilink")* for the "Mean Tweets" segment, in
which he read a [tweet](twitter "wikilink") mocking him over the jeans.
[Jimmy Kimmel](Jimmy_Kimmel "wikilink") then appeared on stage wearing
high-waisted jeans, and attempted to defend them.[10]
