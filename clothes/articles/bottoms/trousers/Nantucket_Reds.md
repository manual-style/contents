**Nantucket Reds** are a style of trousers distributed by Murray's
Toggery Shop on the island of [Nantucket](Nantucket "wikilink"). The
pants were featured in *[The Official Preppy
Handbook](The_Official_Preppy_Handbook "wikilink")*.[1]

## Description

*Nantucket Reds* were originally inspired by [cotton](cotton "wikilink")
trousers worn in [Brittany](Brittany "wikilink").[2] A characteristic of
Reds is that they fade to a "dusty rose" as they age.[3] Since their
inception, the cotton canvas pants have been marketed as shorts. The
distinctive salmon pink color has since been used on hats, shirts,
sweaters and socks. Reds are worn predominantly by summer residents of
[Nantucket](Nantucket "wikilink"), [Martha's
Vineyard](Martha's_Vineyard "wikilink"), and [Cape
Cod](Cape_Cod "wikilink") in place of khakis or
[chinos](chinos "wikilink").[4]

## Distribution

Reds are a [preppy](preppy "wikilink") style of trousers which are
produced and distributed to the public by Murray's Toggery Shop, which
is located on Main Street on the island of Nantucket, in
Massachusetts.[5] Nantucket Reds are marketed as "Guaranteed to
Fade."[6]
