**Pedal pushers** are calf-length [trousers](trousers "wikilink") that
were popular during the 1950s and the early 1960s.[1] Often
[cuffed](cuff "wikilink") and worn tight to the skin, they are related
in style to [capri pants](capri_pants "wikilink"), and are sometimes
referred to as "clam diggers". The name "pedal pushers" originated from
the style originally worn by cyclists, because long pants can catch in
bicycle chains, but the style quickly became identified with teenage
girls.[2]

## In popular culture

They are the subject of "Pink Pedal Pushers", a 1958 song by [Carl
Perkins](Carl_Perkins "wikilink").[3] A novelty song from the 1950s on
MGM records was called "Skin Tight, Pin Striped, Purple Pedal Pushers"
by [Sheb Wooley](Sheb_Wooley "wikilink"), who had his biggest hit with
"[Purple People Eater](Purple_People_Eater "wikilink")". [Tom
Waits](Tom_Waits "wikilink") uses a reference to pedal pushers to
emphasize the youth of a "little Jersey girl" in the song [Heartattack
and Vine](Heartattack_and_Vine "wikilink").
