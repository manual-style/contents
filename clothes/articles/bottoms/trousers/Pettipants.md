**Pettipants** are a type of [lingerie](lingerie "wikilink") worn by
women. The name is a portmanteau of *petticoat* (ultimately from French
*petit*, "small") and *pants*. Pettipants are similar to long shorts,
though they may be made from material such as cotton and lace, and
usually have ruffles down each leg. They are available in different
lengths up to knee length.

When pettipants were fashionable, they were usually worn under skirts,
dresses, culottes, or walking shorts for modesty or comfort. However,
they are not considered a modern or popular style; currently they are
most likely to be worn by [square dancers](square_dance "wikilink") or
persons involved in [historical
reenactment](historical_reenactment "wikilink").

Unlike other types of underwear, pettipants will not ride up and
eliminate hot-weather chafing.
