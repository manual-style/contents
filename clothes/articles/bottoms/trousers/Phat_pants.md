![](Ravers.jpg "fig:Ravers.jpg") **Phat pants**, **phatties**, or
**phats** are a style of [pants](pants "wikilink") that are fitted at
the waist, but get increasingly wide down the legs, covering the feet
entirely due to their width. Phat pants can be made out of a variety of
materials, however [denim](denim "wikilink"), [faux
fur](faux_fur "wikilink"), and cotton fabric tend to be the most common.
High-end customized phats tend to include UV reflective tape decoration
to add a glowing effect. Phat pants are notable for being a visual
identifier of those within the [rave](rave "wikilink") community.
Popular makers of phat pants include Kikwear, UFO and
[JNCO](JNCO "wikilink").[1]

Phat pants originated in 1990. A Melbourne raver who could not wear slim
pants due to thick legs, started making them to fit her frame. Rose to
popularity in early 1990s with Tina Borg, Renegade and continued to grow
into candy phat pantz in 1995 within the kandi kid community of ravers.
Also called **B-pants**, the trend regained attention in the wake of the
[2010s](2010s "wikilink") in the form of snowboard pants.
