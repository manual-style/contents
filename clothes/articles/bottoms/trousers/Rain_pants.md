**Rain pants**, also called **rain trousers**, are
[waterproof](waterproof "wikilink") or
[water-resistant](water-resistant "wikilink")
[pants](trousers "wikilink") worn to protect the body from
[rain](rain "wikilink"). Rain pants may be combined with a [rain
jacket](rain_jacket "wikilink") to make a rain suit. Rain
[gaiters](gaiters "wikilink") may also be used for further
protection.[1]

While rain pants can be made of plastic or coated nylon,[2] modern
waterproof materials are commonly used, including [waterproof-breathable
fabric](waterproof_fabric "wikilink") such as
[Gore-Tex](Gore-Tex "wikilink").[3]
