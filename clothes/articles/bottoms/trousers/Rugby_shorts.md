player is tackled on the shorts.\]\] **Rugby shorts** are a type of
shorts that are worn while playing [rugby](rugby_football "wikilink").
They are designed to take the strains of the game and have traditionally
been made from [cotton](cotton "wikilink").

## IRB Regulations on shorts

Law 4 of the [International Rugby
Board](International_Rugby_Board "wikilink") (IRB) Laws of the Game of
Rugby Union 2010 relates to the clothing that a player may wear while
playing [rugby union](rugby_union "wikilink"). In particular:

-   Law 4.4 (c) states that:

*"A player must not wear any items containing buckles, clips, rings,
hinges, zippers, screws, bolts or rigid material or projection."*

-   Law 4.4 (f) states that:

*"A player must not wear shorts with padding sewn into them".* [1]

## Fit

Shorts should be comfortable, as tight shorts increase the chances of
sustaining a serious injury. The longer and baggier shorts are, the
easier it will be for opponents to pull an opponent back.[2] The colour
and style of shorts are determined by the players club.[3]

## Construction

Rugby shorts must be able to withstand punishment and should be thick
enough to provide some protection while playing. Most have pockets and
many have a drawstring to prevent them coming down when tackled.[4]
While the most popular material has been cotton, modern shorts can also
be made from higher grade [polyester](polyester "wikilink") with
reinforced seams.[5] The use of these shorts is increasing as they are
lighter, more durable, more comfortable, and better retain their color
compared to traditional cotton shorts.[6]

### Variations

-   [Tag rugby](Tag_rugby "wikilink") shorts are generally lighter due
    to the non-contact nature of the sport and have tags attached with
    [velcro](velcro "wikilink") patches.[7]

## Underwear

The use of hard plastic padding of any kind, including abdominal guards
(box), is forbidden in most leagues. However, unpadded [jock
straps](jock_straps "wikilink") can be used to provide to provide
support and prevent groin injuries. In the United States, the
high-padding of [American football](American_football "wikilink") has
influenced some junior leagues to allow, or in some cases require,
abdominal guards and jock straps.

## Manufacturers of rugby shorts

[Canterbury of New Zealand](Canterbury_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") is the
most popular producer of rugby kit. [Kooga](Kooga "wikilink") are a very
popular supplier, particularly to [rugby
league](rugby_league "wikilink") teams. Paladin Sports is also a very
popular manufacturer for both Union & League, as is Triple Play from
Australia.
