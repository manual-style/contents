![](Running-shorts-black.png "fig:Running-shorts-black.png") **Running
shorts** are a specialized form of [shorts](shorts "wikilink") worn by
[runners](Running "wikilink").

## Materials

Running shorts are designed to facilitate comfort and free movement
during exercise. Their materials are lightweight and hard-wearing. Many
running shorts include an inner lining that acts as underwear, so
wearing separate underwear is not necessary.
[Polyester](Polyester "wikilink") is a common fabric in running shorts
and makes it comfortable.

## Variants

Many running shorts have a seam cut up the side of each leg to enable
freer movement. Manufacturers define running shorts according to the
length of the leg which is not cut. For example, a 3/4 seam means that
1/4 of the length is cut.

-   1/2 split seam shorts are the shortest.
-   3/4 split seam shorts are short, but not as short as 1/2 split seam
    shorts.
-   Square leg shorts have no split at all.

Longer shorts are not ideal for running. A runner's stride may pull up
the shorts' fabric, which can cause discomfort. Nonetheless, some
runners prefer longer shorts because they cover a greater portion of
their legs.

Some runners use athletic [hot pants](hot_pants "wikilink") as running
shorts. Like 1/2 split seam shorts, hot pants do not encumber leg
movement.

[Lycra](Lycra "wikilink") running shorts are an alternative to
conventional, polyester-based shorts. In most cases, they reach the
mid-thigh. They are skin-tight, so they allow for more flexible,
unencumbered movement.
