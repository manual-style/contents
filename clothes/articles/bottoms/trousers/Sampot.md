![](Khmerr_restaurant_dancer.jpg "fig:Khmerr_restaurant_dancer.jpg") The
**sampot** (សំពត់, [ALA-LC](ALA-LC_Romanization "wikilink"): saṃbát, ),
a long, rectangular cloth worn around the lower body, is a traditional
dress in [Cambodia](Cambodia "wikilink").[1] It can be draped and folded
in several different ways. The traditional dress is similar to the
[dhoti](dhoti "wikilink") of [Southern Asia](Southern_Asia "wikilink").
It is also worn in the neighboring countries of [Laos](Laos "wikilink")
and [Thailand](Thailand "wikilink") where it is known as [pha
nung](pha_nung "wikilink") (, ).[2]

## Origins

![](Awatdevatasupperlevel01.JPG "fig:Awatdevatasupperlevel01.JPG")s
dressed in *sampot*.\]\] The sampot dates back to the [Funan
era](Kingdom_of_Funan "wikilink") when a Cambodian king ordered the
people of his kingdom to wear the sampot at the request of Chinese
envoys.[3] It is similar to the [lungi](lungi "wikilink") and
[dhoti](dhoti "wikilink") worn in the [Indian
subcontinent](Indian_subcontinent "wikilink"), the
[longyi](longyi "wikilink") worn in [Burma](Burma "wikilink"), and the
[sarong](sarong "wikilink") worn in [maritime Southeast
Asia](maritime_Southeast_Asia "wikilink"). [Silk](Silk "wikilink")
weaving was an important part of Cambodia's cultural past. People from
[Takéo Province](Takéo_Province "wikilink") have woven silk since the
Funan era and records, bas-reliefs, and [Zhou
Daguan](Zhou_Daguan "wikilink")'s report have shown that looms were used
to weave sampots since ancient times.[4] Complex methods and intricate
patterns have been developed to make the cloth, one of which is the hol
method which involves dyeing patterns on silk before weaving. What
remains unique to Cambodian weavers is the uneven twill technique. The
reason they adopted such an unusual method remains unclear.[5] However,
little is known about the old Khmer vocabulary for these fabrics, and if
the sampot today was simply changed over time from the original
Angkorian textiles. The ancient [bas-reliefs](bas-reliefs "wikilink")
however provide a complete look at what fabrics were like, down to
patterns and pleats. Silk woven cloths are used in
[weddings](weddings "wikilink") and [funerals](funerals "wikilink") and
for decoration of temples.[6]

## Textiles

There are three important silk textiles in Cambodia. They include the
ikat silks (chong kiet in Khmer), or hol, the twill-patterned silks and
the weft ikat textiles. Patterns are made by tying natural and
[synthetic fibers](synthetic_fibers "wikilink") on the weft threads and
then it is dyed. It is repeated for different colors until the patterns
firm and cloth is woven. Traditionally, five colors are used,
predominantly red, yellow, green, blue and black. The Sampot Hol is used
as a lower garment and as the sampot chang kben. The Pidan Hol is used
as a ceremonial hanging used for religious purposes.

## Variations

![](Sampot_Phamuong.jpg "fig:Sampot_Phamuong.jpg") There are many
variations of the sampot, each is worn according to class. The typical
regular sampot, known also as the [sarong](sarong "wikilink") is
typically worn by men and women of [lower
class](Working_class "wikilink"). It measures approximately one and a
half meters and both ends are sewn together. It is tied to secure it on
the waist.

-   The *Sampot Phamuong* (សំពត់ផាមួង
    [ALA-LC](ALA-LC_Romanization "wikilink"): saṃbát phā muaṅ) are many
    different variations of traditional Khmer textiles. They are single
    colored and twill woven. There are currently 52 colors used in
    Sampot Phamuong. The Phamuong Chorabap is a
    [luxurious](luxurious "wikilink") fabric using up to 22 needles to
    create. Phamuong variation are rabak, chorcung, anlounh, kaneiv and
    bantok. It usually uses floral and geometric motifs. The most
    [valued](Value_(economics) "wikilink") silk used to create the
    Phamuong is Cambodian yellow [silk](silk "wikilink"), known for its
    fine quality in the region. New [designs](designs "wikilink") draw
    inspiration from ancient patterns on old silk.

The *Sampot Hol* (សំពត់ហូល [ALA-LC](ALA-LC_Romanization "wikilink"):
saṃbát hūl) is a typical traditional textile. There are two kinds of
Sampot Hol, one is a wrapping skirt that uses a technique called chong
kiet and twill weave. Influenced by the Indian patola, it developed
patterns and techniques over the centuries to become a genuine Khmer art
style. The sampot hol has over 200 patterns combined with three to five
colors, yellow, red, brown, blue, and green. There are four variations,
sampot hol, sampot hol por, sampot hol kben, and sampot hol ktong.
Patterns are usually geometric motifs, animals, and flower motifs.

## In daily life

The sampot is deeply rooted in Cambodia. Even though the
[French](France "wikilink") brought a degree of
[Westernization](Westernization "wikilink") to Cambodia, Cambodians
continued to wear the Sampot. [Royalty](Royal_family "wikilink") and
government officials used the sampot chang kben with a formal jacket.
The sampot chang kben and sampot phamuong are still worn by Cambodians
today during special occasions, and rural and poor Khmers still prefer
it over Western-style clothing for its comfort. The material used by
poor and rural Cambodians is not hand-woven silk but printed
[batik-patterned](batik "wikilink") cloth imported from
[Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink"). It is still popular with both men and
women alike and is regarded by the people of Cambodia as their [national
garment](traditional_dress "wikilink").
