[thumb\|200px\|Idealized *sans-culotte* by [Louis-Léopold
Boilly](Louis-Léopold_Boilly "wikilink")
(1761–1845).](/Image:Sans-culotte.jpg "wikilink")

The ***sans-culottes*** (, literally "without
[breeches](/culottes "wikilink")") were the common people of the lower
classes in late 18th century France, a great many of whom became radical
and militant partisans of the [French
Revolution](/French_Revolution "wikilink") in response to their [poor
quality of life](/French_Revolution#Causes "wikilink") under the
*[Ancien Régime](/Ancien_Régime "wikilink")*.[1] The word sans-culotte,
which is opposed to that of the [aristocrat](/aristocrat "wikilink"),
seems to have been used for the first time on 28 February 1791 by
officer [Gauthier](/Jean-Bernard_Gauthier_de_Murnan "wikilink") in a
deregatory sense, speaking about a "sans-culottes army".[2] The word
came in vogue during the [demonstration of 20 June
1792](/demonstration_of_20_June_1792 "wikilink").[3]

The name *sans-culottes* refers to their clothing, and through that to
their lower-class status: *[culottes](/culottes "wikilink")* were the
fashionable silk [knee-breeches](/Breeches "wikilink") of the
18th-century [nobility](/French_nobility "wikilink") and
[bourgeoisie](/Bourgeoisie#In_France_and_French-speaking_countries "wikilink"),
and the [working class](/working_class "wikilink") *sans-culottes* wore
[*pantaloons*](/Trousers#Modern_Europe "wikilink"), or trousers,
instead.[4] The *sans-culottes*, most of them urban labourers, served as
the driving popular force behind the revolution. They were judged by the
other revolutionaries as "radicals" because they advocated a [direct
democracy](/direct_democracy "wikilink"), that is to say, without
intermediaries such as members of parliament. Though ill-clad people and
ill-equipped, with little or no support from the upper class, they made
up the bulk of the [Revolutionary
army](/French_Revolutionary_Army "wikilink") during the early years of
the [French Revolutionary
Wars](/French_Revolutionary_Wars "wikilink").[5]

## Political ideals

[thumb\|A sans-culotte with a

They were expressing their demands through petitions of the sections
presented to the assemblies (the Legislative, and Convention) by the
delegates. The sans-culottes had a third way of putting pressure on the
policy: the police and the courts received thousands of denunciations of
traitors and supposed conspirators.[6] The most fundamental political
ideals of the *sans-culottes* were [social
equality](/social_equality "wikilink"), [economic
equality](/Economic_egalitarianism "wikilink"), and [popular
democracy](/popular_democracy "wikilink"). They supported the abolition
of all the authority and privileges of the
[monarchy](/House_of_Bourbon "wikilink"), nobility, and [Roman Catholic
clergy](/History_of_Roman_Catholicism_in_France#The_Revolution "wikilink"),
the establishment of fixed wages, the implementation of [price
controls](/General_maximum "wikilink") to ensure affordable food and
other essentials, and vigilance against
[counter-revolutionaries](/Counter-revolutionary "wikilink").[7][8] The
height of their influence spanned roughly from the original overthrow of
the monarchy in 1792 to the [Thermidorian
Reaction](/National_Convention#Thermidorian_Reaction "wikilink") in
1794.[9] Throughout the revolution, the *sans-culottes* provided the
principal support behind the more radical and anti-bourgeoisie factions
of the [Paris Commune](/Paris_Commune_(French_Revolution) "wikilink"),
such as the [Enragés](/Enragés "wikilink") and the
[Hébertists](/Hébertists "wikilink"), and were led by populist
revolutionaries such as [Jacques Roux](/Jacques_Roux "wikilink") and
[Jacques Hébert](/Jacques_Hébert "wikilink").[10][11] The
*sans-culottes* also populated the ranks of
[paramilitary](/paramilitary "wikilink") forces charged with physically
enforcing the policies and legislation of the revolutionary government,
a task that commonly included violence and the carrying out of
executions against perceived enemies of the revolution.

During the peak of their influence, the *sans-culottes* were seen as the
truest and most authentic sons of the French Revolution, held up as
living representations of the revolutionary spirit. During the height of
revolutionary fervor, such as during the [Reign of
Terror](/Reign_of_Terror "wikilink") when it was dangerous to be
associated with anything counter-revolutionary, even public
functionaries and officials actually from middle or upper-class
backgrounds adopted the clothing and label of the *sans-culottes* as a
demonstration of solidarity with the working class and patriotism for
the new [French Republic](/French_First_Republic "wikilink").[12]

But by early 1794, as the bourgeois and middle class elements of the
revolution began to gain more political influence, the fervent working
class [radicalism](/Political_radicalism "wikilink") of the
*sans-culottes* rapidly began falling out of favor within the National
Convention.[13] It was not long before [Maximilien de
Robespierre](/Maximilien_de_Robespierre "wikilink") and the now dominant
[Jacobin Club](/Jacobin_Club "wikilink") turned against the radical
factions of the National Convention, including the *sans-culottes*,
despite their having previously been the strongest supporters of the
revolution and its government. Several important leaders of the Enragés
and Hébertists were imprisoned and executed by the very [revolutionary
tribunals](/Revolutionary_Tribunal "wikilink") they had supported.[14]
The execution of radical leader [Jacques
Hébert](/Jacques_Hébert "wikilink") spelled the decline of the
*sans-culottes*,[15] and with the successive rise of even more
conservative governments, the [Thermidorian
Convention](/Thermidorian_Convention "wikilink") and the [French
Directory](/French_Directory "wikilink"), they were definitively
silenced as a political force.[16] After the defeat of the [1795 popular
revolt in Paris](/Revolt_of_1_Prairial_Year_III "wikilink"), the
*sans-culottes* ceased to play any effective political role in France
until the [July Revolution of 1830](/July_Revolution "wikilink").

## Appearance

The distinctive costume of typical *sans-culottes* featured:[17]

-   the [*pantalon*](/Trousers#Modern_Europe "wikilink") (long trousers)
    – in place of the *culottes* (silk knee-breeches) worn by the upper
    classes[18]
-   the [carmagnole](/carmagnole "wikilink") (short-skirted coat)
-   the red [Phrygian cap](/Phrygian_cap "wikilink"), also known as a
    "liberty cap"
-   *[sabots](/Sabot_(shoe) "wikilink")* (a type of wooden
    [clog](/clog "wikilink"))

[thumb\|right\|The uprising of the Parisian sans-culottes from 31 May to
2 June 1793. The scene takes place in front of the Deputies Chamber in
the Tuileries. The depiction shows [Marie-Jean Hérault de

Victurnien
Vergniaud](/Pierre_Victurnien_Vergniaud "wikilink").](/File:The_elimination_of_Girondins.jpg "wikilink")

In April 1792 Robespierre urged in his magazine the creation of an
"armée révolutionnaire" in Paris, consisting of 20,000 men, with the
goal to defend "liberty" (the revolution), maintain order in the
sections and educate the members in democratic principles; an idea he
borrowed from [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau "wikilink")
and [Machiavelli](/Machiavelli "wikilink").[19] According to [Jean
Jaures](/Jean_Jaures "wikilink"), he considered this even more important
than the [right to strike](/right_to_strike "wikilink").[20]

Following the king's veto of the Assembly's efforts to raise a militia
of volunteers, the reinstatement of Brissotin ministers and suppress
[non-juring priests](/Civil_Constitution_of_the_Clergy "wikilink"), the
monarchy faced an abortive [Demonstration of 20 June
1792](/Demonstration_of_20_June_1792 "wikilink").
[Sergent-Marceau](/Sergent-Marceau "wikilink") and
[Panis](/:fr:Étienne-Jean_Panis "wikilink"), the administrators of
police, urged the [Sans-culottes](/Sans-culottes "wikilink") to lay down
their weapons, telling them it was illegal to present a petition in
arms, although their march to the Tuileries was not banned. They invited
the officials join the procession and march along with them.[21]

Early in the morning ([10 August
1792](/10_August_(French_Revolution) "wikilink")) 30,000 Fédérés, and
Sans-culottes militants from the sections led a successful assault upon
the Tuileries; according to Robespierre a triumph for the "passive"
(non-voting) citizens. [Sulpice
Huguenin](/:fr:Sulpice_Huguenin "wikilink"), head of the sans-culottes
in the [Faubourg Saint-Antoine](/Faubourg_Saint-Antoine "wikilink"), was
appointed provisional president of the Insurrectionary Commune.

In Spring 1793, after the treason of [Dumouriez](/Dumouriez "wikilink"),
he urged the creation of a "Sans-culotte army" to sweep away any
conspirator.

On 1 May the crowds threatened armed insurrection if the emergency
measures demanded \[price control\] were not adopted. On 8 and 12 May
Robespierre repeated in the Jacobin club the necessity of founding a
revolutionary army consisting of Sans-culottes, paid by a tax on the
rich, to beat the aristocrats inside France and the Convention. Every
public square should be used to produce arms and pikes. [22] On 18 May
[Guadet](/Élie_Guadet "wikilink") proposed to examine the "exactions"
and to replace municipal authorities.[23][24]

Who was the "true protector" of the Sans-culottes against the rich,
Brissot or Robespierre?[25]-->As rioting persisted a [commission of
inquiry of twelve members](/Commission_of_Twelve "wikilink"), with a
very strong Girondin majority, was set up to investigate the anarchy in
the communes and the activities of the Sans-culottes. On 28 May the
Paris Commune accepted the creation of a sans-culottes army to enforce
revolutionary laws. Petitioners from the sections and the Commune
appeared at the bar of the Convention at about five o'clock in the
afternoon on 31 May. They demanded that a domestic revolutionary army
should be raised and that the price of bread should be fixed at three
sous a pound, that nobles holding senior rank in the army should be
dismissed, that armories should be created for arming the sans-culottes,
the departments of State purged, suspects arrested, the right to vote
provisionally reserved to sans-culottes only, and a fund set apart for
the relatives of those defending their country and for the relief of
aged and infirm.[26][27][28] According to Hampson, the subject is quite
extraordinary complicated and obscure.--> The next day all Paris was in
arms.

Hanriot was ordered to march his National Guard, by this time mostly
existing of Sans-culottes, from the town hall to the [Palais
National](/Tuileries_Palace "wikilink").[29] On 2 June 1793, a large
force of supposedly 80,000 Sans-culottes and National Guards led by
[Hanriot](/Hanriot "wikilink"), surrounded the Convention with 160-172
guns.

On 4 September, the Sans-culottes again invaded the Convention. They
demanded tougher measures against rising prices and the setting up of a
system of terror to root out the counter-revolution.[30] The
Sans-culottes took an especially active interest in the revolutionary
army.[31]

A "Sans-culotte army" was formed in Paris, to sweep away
conspirators.[32] (A force of citizen-soldiers which could go into the
countryside to supervise the requisition of grain, to prevent the
manoeuvres of rich *égoistes* and deliver them up to the vengeance of
the laws'.[33])

Three months later, on 4 December the departmental *armées
revolutionnaires* (except in Paris) were banned on proposal of
Tallien.[34][35][36][37] The sections lost all rights to control their
delegates and officials.

On 4 March 1794 there were rumours of uprising in the Cordeliers club.
The Hébertists hoped that the National Convention would expel
Robespierre and his Montagnard supporters.[38] sansculottes did not
respond and Hanriot refused to cooperate? On 13 March Hébert, the voice
of the Sans-culottes, had been using the latest issue of *Le Père
Duchesne* to criticise Robespierre. On 18 March Bourdon attacked the
Commune and the Sans-culottes army.
([Ronsin](/Charles-Philippe_Ronsin "wikilink"),
[Vincent](/François-Nicolas_Vincent "wikilink"),
[Momoro](/Antoine-François_Momoro "wikilink"), Clootz, etc.) were
arrested on charges of complicity with foreign powers ([William Pitt the
Younger](/William_Pitt_the_Younger "wikilink")), etc. and guillotined on
24 March. (Hanriot was denounced by the Revolutionary Tribunal as an
accomplice of Hébert, but seems to have been protected by
Robespierre.[39])

## Montagnard influence

The working class was especially hurt by a hail storm which damaged
grain crops in 1788, which caused bread prices to skyrocket.[40] While
the peasants of rural France could sustain themselves with their farms,
and the wealthy [aristocracy](/French_nobility "wikilink") could still
afford bread, the urban workers of France, the group that comprised the
*sans-culottes*, suffered. In the city, division grew between the
*sans-culottes* and these wealthy aristocrats; the former had a
particular hostility “towards those with large private incomes.”[41]

The faction known as the [Montagnards](/The_Mountain "wikilink")
expressed concern for the working classes of France.[42] When the
[National Convention](/National_Convention "wikilink") met to discuss
the fate of the former king [Louis XVI](/Louis_XVI_of_France "wikilink")
in 1792, the *sans-culottes* vehemently opposed a proper
[trial](/Trial_of_Louis_XVI "wikilink"), instead opting for an immediate
[execution](/Execution_of_Louis_XVI "wikilink"). The moderate
[Girondin](/Girondins "wikilink") faction voted for a trial, but the
radical Montagnards sided with the *sans-culottes*, deeming that a trial
was not necessary, and won with a slim majority. Louis XVI was executed
on January 17, 1793.[43]

The demands of the *sans-culottes* did not stop with the execution of
the King, and the Montagnards worked hard to fulfill their mounting
orders. This increased pressure from the radical masses exacerbated the
ideological split between the Montagnards and the Girondins, and
tensions began to grow within the Convention.[44] Eventually, by May of
1793, the Montagnards worked with the [National
Guard](/National_Guard_(France) "wikilink") -- which was, at this time,
mostly *sans-culottes* -- to depose many of the Girondin deputies.
Jeremy Popkin writes, “\[the Montagnards and the *sans-culottes*\]
surrounded the Convention, and two days later the intimidated assembly
suspended twenty-nine Girondin deputies. The defeated Girondin leaders
fled to the [provinces](/Provinces_of_France "wikilink"). The
Montagnards were left in control of the Convention, which itself was
clearly at the mercy of whoever could command the armed *sans-culottes*
battalions.”[45] Now, whoever was in control of France’s destiny had to
answer to the *sans-culottes*, who “effectively exercised legislative
power” in situations of unrest.[46] Otherwise, they would risk a similar
uprising and their own exile, or possibly even execution. This political
shift towards radicalism would soon turn into the Reign of Terror.

## Reign of Terror

[thumb\|(left) *Sans-culotte*, compare figures wearing *culottes*
right.](/Image:Sansculottes.jpg "wikilink")

The mass violence of the *sans-culottes* created a lasting impact during
the Reign of Terror. These revolutionaries allied themselves most
readily with those in power who promised radical change. The
*sans-culottes* believed in a complete upheaval of the government,
pushing for the execution of any that were considered corrupt by the
leaders, even going as far as wanting “the enemies of the republic
\[to\] hang-main and the [guillotine](/guillotine "wikilink") to stand
like the first patriots, the finisher of the law.”[47] The support of
the *sans-culottes* could be used as a political weapon to get rid of
enemies of the Revolution. The key to Robespierre’s Terror lay in their
willingness and ability to mobilize. Thus, the
[Committee](/Committee_of_Public_Safety "wikilink") leaders used
speeches to gain their support. In a speech *On the Principles of
Political Morality.*[48] Robespierre proclaimed: “It has been said that
terror was the mainspring of despotic government. Does your government,
then, resemble a despotism? Yes, as the sword which glitters in the
hands of liberty's heroes resembles the one with which tyranny's lackeys
are armed.” Robespierre expressed a desire for liberty that the
*sans-culottes* admired. They pushed the Committee for radical changes
and often found a voice with Robespierre. Their desperate desire for
immediate changes and their aptitude for violence made the
*sans-culottes* a necessary group in implementing the Terror.

## Legacy

The popular image of the *sans-culotte* has gained currency as an
enduring symbol for the passion, idealism and
[patriotism](/patriotism "wikilink") of the common man of the [French
Revolution](/French_Revolution "wikilink").[49] The term
**sans-culottism**, *sans-culottisme* in French, refers to this
idealized image and the themes associated with it.[50] Many public
figures and revolutionaries who were not strictly working class styled
themselves *citoyens sans-culottes* in solidarity and recognition.[51]
However, in the period immediately following the [Thermidorian
Reaction](/Thermidorian_Reaction "wikilink") the *sans-culottes* and
other [far-left](/left-wing_politics "wikilink") [political
factions](/political_faction "wikilink") were heavily persecuted and
repressed by the likes of the [Muscadins](/Muscadin "wikilink").[52]

The [French Republican Calendar](/French_Republican_Calendar "wikilink")
at first termed the complementary days at the end of the year
*[Sansculottides](/Sansculottides "wikilink")*; however, the [National
Convention](/National_Convention "wikilink") suppressed the name when
adopting the [Constitution of the Year
III](/Constitution_of_the_Year_III "wikilink") (1795) and substituted
the name *jours complémentaires* ("additional days").[53]

## Analysis

According to Sally Waller, part of the *sans-culottes* mantra was
"permanent anticipation of betrayal and treachery".[54] The members of
the *sans-culottes* were constantly on edge and fearing betrayal, which
can be attributed to their violent and radical rebellion tactics.[55]
Marxist historian [Eric Hobsbawm](/Eric_Hobsbawm "wikilink") observes
that the *sans-culottes* were a "shapeless, mostly urban movement of the
labouring poor, small craftsmen, shopkeepers, artisans, tiny
entrepreneurs and the like".[56] He further notes they were organised
notably in the local political clubs of Paris and "provided the main
striking-force of the revolution".[57] Hobsbawm writes that these were
the actual demonstrators, rioters and constructors of street
[barricades](/barricade "wikilink"). However, Hobsbawm maintains,
*sans-culottism* provided no real alternative to the bourgeois
radicalism of the [Jacobins](/Jacobin_(politics) "wikilink");[58] from
Hobsbawm's Marxist perspective, the ideal of the *sans-culottes*, which
sought to express the interests of the 'little men' who existed between
the poles of the [bourgeois](/bourgeoisie "wikilink") and the
[proletarian](/proletariat "wikilink"), was contradictory and ultimately
unrealizable.[59]

The Marxist historian [Albert Soboul](/Albert_Soboul "wikilink")
emphasized the importance of the *sans-culottes* as a social class, a
sort of proto-proletariat that played a central role in the French
Revolution. That view has been sharply attacked by scholars who say the
*sans-culottes* were not a class at all. Indeed, as one historian points
out, Soboul's concept has not been used by scholars in any other period
of French history.[60]

## Modern colloquial usage

Ironically, given its origin as a term to describe men's breeches, the
term "culottes" in French is now used to describe women's underpants, an
article of clothing that has little or no relation to the historic
culottes. The term *"sans-culottes"* has been used colloquially to mean
not wearing underpants.[61]
