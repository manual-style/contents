**Sharovary** (*ir. sharavara*, pers. شلوار -*shalvar*) are a kind of
men's pants, part of the national clothes of [Ukrainian
Cossacks](Ukrainian_Cossacks "wikilink") - are free to hips, often with
assembly at the waist, collected at the bottom near the ankles.

Similar pants in other cultures are [Sirwal](Sirwal "wikilink"),
[Salwar](Salwar "wikilink"), [Shalwar
kameez](Shalwar_kameez "wikilink"), etc.

The presence of wide trousers in the territory of
[Ukraine](Ukraine "wikilink") designed for riding originate with the
[Scythians](Scythians "wikilink"). Exposure to similar Turkish modes of
dress would have occurred in battle on the steppes of Ukraine. The
presence of sharovary in the dress of the [Ukrainian
Cossacks](Ukrainian_Cossacks "wikilink") of
[Zaporizhia](Zaporizhia "wikilink") is noted by German ambassador Erich
Lassota in the 16th century. A comprehensive description of Cossack
dress is included in the publication of 1651 Description of Ukraine by
Polish-enlisted French-born cartographer and military engineer
[Guillaume Le Vasseur de
Beauplan](Guillaume_Le_Vasseur_de_Beauplan "wikilink"). It lists the
shirts, hats and [kaptan](Żupan "wikilink") of thick cloth that made up
the Ukrainian Cossack everyday clothes.
