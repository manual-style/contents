**Shorts** are a [garment](garment "wikilink") worn over the
[pelvic](human_pelvis "wikilink") area, circling the
[waist](waist "wikilink") and splitting to cover the upper part of the
legs, sometimes extending down to the knees but not covering the entire
length of the [leg](leg "wikilink"). They are called "shorts" because
they are a shortened version of [trousers](trousers "wikilink"), which
cover the entire leg, but not the foot. Shorts are typically worn in
warm weather or in an environment where comfort and air flow are more
important than the protection of the legs.

There are a variety of shorts, ranging from knee-length short trousers
that can in some situations be worn as formal clothes to
[beachwear](beachwear "wikilink") and athletic shorts. Some types of
shorts are typically worn by women, such as
[culottes](culotte "wikilink"), which are a divided
[skirt](skirt "wikilink") resembling a pair of loose-cut shorts.

## Terminological differences

The British English term, *short trousers*, is used, only for shorts
that are a short version of ordinary trousers (i.e., *pants* or *slacks*
in American English). For example: tailored shorts, often lined, as
typically worn as part of a [school uniform](school_uniform "wikilink")
for boys up to their early teens,[1][2][3] and by servicemen and
policemen in tropical climates. *Shorts*, used unqualified in British
English, refers to sports shorts, athletic shorts, or casual shorts; the
last is nowadays commonplace in warm weather in the UK. Shorts are also
known as "half pants" in India.

The American English term, *short pants*, is probably the nearest
equivalent in the U.S., where they might now be called *dress shorts*, a
term that has not gained much currency in Britain.

A somewhat similar garment worn by men in Australia is called
*[stubbies](Stubbies_(brand) "wikilink")*.

The term, *boxer shorts*, is an American coinage for a particular kind
of men's [underwear](underwear "wikilink"), and is now also common in
Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to merely as *boxers*
in the USA. Moreover, whereas the American English usage of the word
*pants* refers to outerwear (i.e., *trousers* in British English), the
usage of *pants* in British English refers to the garment worn under
one’s trousers, such as boxers; such a garment, however, is referred to
as *[underpants](underpants "wikilink")* in American English (note the
qualification of the word *pants* by the word *under*).

## Sociology

### Europe and America

In much of Europe and the Americas during the 19th and early 20th
centuries, shorts were worn as outerwear only by young boys until they
reached a certain height or maturity. When boys got older, typically
around puberty, they would receive their first pair of long trousers.
This produced the perception that shorts were only for young boys.
Because of this, men would not wear shorts to avoid looking immature.
Women tended not to wear shorts in most cultures, due to social mores:
they were expected to wear [dresses](dress "wikilink"), or
[skirts](skirt "wikilink") and [blouses](blouse "wikilink").

In the 1890s, knee pants (an early type of short pants) became the
standard wear for American boys. Many urban school portraits from the
1890s show all but the oldest boys wearing knee pants.[4] North American
boys normally wore knee pants with short stockings.[5] This began to
change after the 1900s when North American boys began wearing
[knickerbockers](knickerbockers_(clothing) "wikilink") during the
winter, while short pants became more popular in Europe. In the 1930s,
shorts started to be worn for casual comfort (e.g. outdoor and athletic
activities) by both men and women. However, it was still taboo to wear
shorts outside certain activities.

Since about the time of [The First World
War](The_First_World_War "wikilink"), when many soldiers served in
tropical locations, adult men have worn shorts more often, especially in
summer weather, but the perception of shorts as being only for young
boys took several decades to change, and to some extent still exists in
certain circles. By the late 20th century however it became common for
men to wear shorts as casual wear in summer.

However, in many countries there are few formal settings where wearing
shorts would be acceptable, as they are considered [casual
wear](casual_wear "wikilink"). Notable exceptions where men may wear
short trousers to the office or at a formal gathering are South Africa,
Bermuda, Australia and New Zealand. Since the 1990s, casual office dress
has grown to include formal shorts in some U.K. and U.S. businesses, but
by no means universally.

### Worldwide

Adults are also commonly seen wearing shorts, however wearing shorts is
less common among women in traditional eastern countries than in the
West, although this varies widely by region - women more often wear
shorts in large, cosmopolitan cities. In some countries adult women can
be seen wearing loose-fitting shorts that end at or just below the knee,
as these are seen as sufficiently modest.[6]
