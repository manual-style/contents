**Sirwal**, also **saroual**,[1][2] **seroual**, **sarouel** or
**serouel**[3] ( (*sirwāl*); (*šalvâr*); (*shawal*); (*shalwâr*); ; ;
(*şalbar*); (*shalwar*)), also known as *punjabi pants* and, in some
contexts, as (a subtype of) [Harem pants](Harem_pants "wikilink"), are a
form of baggy trousers predating the [Christian
era](Christian_era "wikilink").[4] They are typically worn in
[Muslim](Muslim "wikilink") countries, but also extensively in the
[Greek](Greece "wikilink") countryside and other places in the
[Balkans](Balkans "wikilink") that were influenced by [Ottoman
Turks](Ottoman_Turks "wikilink") prior to [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink"). The trousers are not originally an
[Arab](Arab "wikilink") garment but were introduced from
[Persia](Persia "wikilink") to other [Mideastern
regions](Middle_East "wikilink").[5][6] The sirwal is also worn by
communities in [North India](North_India "wikilink").[7]

The [drawstring](drawstring "wikilink") allows the sirwal to be worn at
either the waist or hip level. Sirwals are commonly worn by Arab men
under the *[thawb](thawb "wikilink")*, or alone with some sort of loose
top.

## Types

It is usually made from [cotton](cotton "wikilink"),
[linen](linen "wikilink"), or [polyester](polyester "wikilink").
Sometimes the cuff features [embroidery](embroidery "wikilink").

There are two types of *sirwal*, long and short. Short *sarawil* are
worn by most [Saudi](Saudi "wikilink") men. Men of the Western Region
usually wear long *sarawil*.

## Uniforms

style uniform 1913.\]\] The seroual formed part of the standard uniform
for the [Mameluke](Mameluke "wikilink")[8][9][10] squadrons of
[Napoleon](Napoleon "wikilink")'s [Imperial
Guard](Imperial_Guard "wikilink"), and for the
[Zouave](Zouave "wikilink") and other North African regiments of the
[French Army](French_Army "wikilink") from 1830 to 1962. The French Army
version of the seroual was notable for being cut so widely that it did
not require two separate trouser legs. During the [American Civil
War](American_Civil_War "wikilink") a number of volunteer regiments,
designated as zouaves, also wore seroual breeches, though these were
usually of *[chasseur](chasseur "wikilink")* design, being simply
baggier versions of conventional trousers.[11]

[4] The word is of [Persian](Persian_language#Old_Persian "wikilink")
origin; \[shalwār\] (F. Steingass: *Persian-English Dictionary*, p.758a)
was borrowed into [Greek](Ancient_Greek "wikilink") as σαράβαρα
*sarábāra*, "loose trousers worn by [Scythians](Scythians "wikilink")"
(Liddell & Scott, *A Greek-English Lexicon*). The words used in [Balkan

[Ottoman Turks](Ottoman_Turks "wikilink") and did not continue the
Ancient Greek designation.
