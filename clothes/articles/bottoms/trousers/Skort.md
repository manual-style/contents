**skort** is a pair of shorts with a fabric panel resembling a skirt
covering the front, or a skirt with a pair of integral shorts hidden
underneath.[1]

## History

The term "skort" (a [portmanteau](portmanteau "wikilink") of
[skirt](skirt "wikilink") and [shorts](shorts "wikilink")) is used
idiomatically in some regions. While some garments sold as
[culottes](culottes "wikilink") resemble short
[trousers](trousers "wikilink"), to be skorts they need to look like
skirts. They are distinguished from [trousers](trousers "wikilink") or
shorts by a fuller cut at the bottom ([hem](hem "wikilink")) than at the
waist.

Initially called "trouser skirts," skorts were developed to provide more
freedom to do activities (such as sports, gardening, cleaning, or bike
riding), and give the appearance of a skirt. At first, skorts were not
deemed appropriate to be worn during any non-athletic activity.[2]

Montgomery Ward claimed in their 1959 Spring/Summer catalog to have
invented the garment they called a skort. It was a short knife or
accordion pleated skirt with an attached
[bloomer](Bloomers_(clothing) "wikilink") underneath. Years later, the
term was applied to a pair of shorts with a flap of fabric across the
front (and often the back) making the garment appear to be a skirt. In
recent years, the term skort has been given to any skirt with an
attached pair of shorts.

## Women's sports

Skorts are popular in sports such as [field
hockey](field_hockey "wikilink"), [tennis](tennis "wikilink"),
[golf](golf "wikilink"), [ten-pin bowling](ten-pin_bowling "wikilink")
and [camogie](camogie "wikilink"), and are often part of girls' athletic
uniforms.

The first noted skort-like clothing to be worn as tennis attire was done
so by the Spanish player, [Lilí Álvarez](Lilí_Álvarez "wikilink"), who
wore a pair of culottes which had been shaped to resemble a skirt during
her Wimbledon match in 1931.[3]

Women began to play golf in large numbers in the 1960s, which led to the
development of the famous Leon Levin "Q" skirt or "skort", which offered
the freedom of shorts and soft lines of a skirt. The article became an
immediate favorite on the [Ladies Professional Golf
Tour](LPGA "wikilink"). Professional golfers famously known for wearing
skorts are [Natalie Gulbis](Natalie_Gulbis "wikilink") and [Paula
Creamer](Paula_Creamer "wikilink").
