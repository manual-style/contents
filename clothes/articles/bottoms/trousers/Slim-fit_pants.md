![](Skinny20080428.jpg "fig:Skinny20080428.jpg") pants\]\] **Slim-fit
pants** or **skinny jeans** (when made of [denim](denim "wikilink"))
have a snug fit through the legs and end in a small leg opening that can
be anywhere from 9" to 20" in circumference, depending on size.[1] Other
names for this style include **drainpipes**, **stovepipes**, **tight
pants**, **cigarette pants**, **skinny jeans**, **pencil pants**,
**skinny pants**, **gas pipes**, and **skinnies**. Skinny jeans taper
completely at the bottom of the leg, whereas drainpipe jeans are skinny
but then the lower leg is straight instead of tapering and so they are
often slightly baggier at the bottom of the leg than skinny jeans. In
some styles, [zippers](zippers "wikilink") are needed at the bottom of
the leg to facilitate pulling them over the feet. Stretch
[denim](denim "wikilink"), with anywhere from 2% to 4%
[spandex](spandex "wikilink"), may be used to allow jeans to have a
super-slim fit. Skinny jeans come in a variety of colors and styles.[2]

## History

### Origins

![](French_mens_suit_1765_LACMA.jpg "fig:French_mens_suit_1765_LACMA.jpg"),
as worn during the 17th and 18th centuries as part of the [three piece
suit](three_piece_suit "wikilink")\]\] Before the 18th century, European
men wore [breeches](breeches "wikilink") and
[hose](hose_(clothing) "wikilink"). In Tudor times, these breeches were
loose-fitting, but by the 1660s, tight breeches were fashionable. These
were popularised by Frenchmen at the court of [Louis
XIII](Louis_XIII "wikilink"), as part of the [three piece
suit](three_piece_suit "wikilink") that also included a type of [frock
coat](frock_coat "wikilink") called a
[Justacorps](Justacorps "wikilink"), a [tricorne
hat](tricorne_hat "wikilink"), a [powdered
wig](powdered_wig "wikilink"), and a long
[waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink"). During the [Restoration
era](Restoration_era "wikilink"), the tighter breeches were introduced
to England, and the rest of Europe, because the cut was deemed more
flattering to the leg.[3]

From the 16th until the 19th century, the [Mughlai](Mughlai "wikilink")
nobility attired themselves in tight-fitting
[Churidars](Churidar "wikilink") which were worn tied below the knee.
These trousers, and other elements of traditional clothing like the
[Shalwar Kameez](Shalwar_Kameez "wikilink"), were often worn by
Englishmen working in India, especially officers of the [East India
Trading Company](East_India_Trading_Company "wikilink").[4]

### The early 19th century

![](Eugène_Delacroix_-_Louis-Auguste_Schwiter.jpg "fig:Eugène_Delacroix_-_Louis-Auguste_Schwiter.jpg")
[dandy](dandy "wikilink") wearing [tailcoat](tailcoat "wikilink") and
tight fitting pantaloons\]\] Tight fitting trousers were fashionable
from 1805 until 1850, being descended from the loose work trousers worn
as a political statement by [Sans-Culottes](Sans-Culottes "wikilink")
during the [French Revolution](French_Revolution "wikilink").[5] These
"[pantaloons](trousers "wikilink")," popularised by [Regency
era](Regency_era "wikilink") Englishmen like [Beau
Brummel](Beau_Brummel "wikilink"), were worn high on the waist and
tailored to accentuate the leg like the [breeches](breeches "wikilink")
previously fashionable among the upper class.[6] Pantaloons were tied
(or buttoned) around the ankle and commonly put into boots.

### Decline, 1890–1940

Pants, which had come to mean tight-fitting trousers, but now just a
synonym, fitted more loosely from the 1840s onwards as mass-production
replaced tailoring. Beginning in the [Edwardian
era](Edwardian_era "wikilink") and continuing into the 1920s, [baggy
"Oxford" or "collegiate" trousers](baggy_pants "wikilink") and [plus
fours](plus_fours "wikilink") were fashionable among the younger
generation. As the name suggests, [Oxford bags](Oxford_bags "wikilink")
originated at the UK's elite universities, where young upper class men
pursued an active, sports-centred lifestyle.[7]

### The 1950s

![](Elvis_Presley_promoting_Jailhouse_Rock.jpg "fig:Elvis_Presley_promoting_Jailhouse_Rock.jpg")
wearing drainpipe jeans. In the 1950s, the waist was higher than on
modern skinny jeans.\]\] Drainpipe trousers re-emerged in the 1950s,
with popular [Western](Western_(genre) "wikilink") stars such as the
[singing cowboy](singing_cowboy "wikilink") [Roy
Rogers](Roy_Rogers "wikilink"), The [Lone
Ranger](Lone_Ranger "wikilink"), [The Cisco
Kid](The_Cisco_Kid "wikilink"), [Zorro](Zorro "wikilink") and [Gene
Autry](Gene_Autry "wikilink") and actresses [Marilyn
Monroe](Marilyn_Monroe "wikilink") and [Sandra
Dee](Sandra_Dee "wikilink") wearing their pants very slim to the ankle
from 1955 onwards.[8] Tapered jeans became most notable with [country
music](country_music "wikilink") stars and with the birth of [rock and
roll](rock_and_roll "wikilink") in the 1950s, when [Elvis
Presley](Elvis_Presley "wikilink") donned slim-fitting jeans and shocked
the country.

### The 1960s

In the early 1960s, drainpipes were worn by numerous rock bands and
musicians, including [The Beatles](The_Beatles "wikilink"), [The Rolling
Stones](The_Rolling_Stones "wikilink") and [Bob
Dylan](Bob_Dylan "wikilink"). Fashion icon [Audrey
Hepburn](Audrey_Hepburn "wikilink") also raised the popularity of
drainpipe jeans. Slim fitting pants and jeans were worn not just by
members of the teenage [Mod](Mod_(subculture) "wikilink") or [greaser
subculture](greaser_subculture "wikilink") but also ordinary people. By
1962, [Sears](Sears "wikilink") were selling tight jeans made from
"stretch" denim that incorporated [elastane](elastane "wikilink").[9]
The trend lasted until the end of the 1960s when
"[hippie](hippie "wikilink")" culture gave rise to flared pants and
[bell bottom](bell_bottom "wikilink") jeans.

### The 1970s

In the early 1970s, [glam rock](glam_rock "wikilink") and
[rockabilly](rockabilly "wikilink") bands reviving the [Teddy
Boy](Teddy_Boy "wikilink") look popularised drainpipe jeans in contrast
to the [flared trousers](flared_trousers "wikilink") worn by hippies.
Red [tartan](tartan "wikilink") drainpipe jeans (as they were then
called) were popular in the [punk
subculture](punk_subculture "wikilink") of the late 1970s, and were worn
by many bands and scene leaders such as [Ramones](Ramones "wikilink"),
[The Clash](The_Clash "wikilink") and [Sex
Pistols](Sex_Pistols "wikilink").

### The 1980s

![](Poison.JPG "fig:Poison.JPG") band
[Poison](Poison_(American_band) "wikilink") wearing stonewashed
drainpipe jeans\]\] Skin-tight [acid-washed](acid-wash "wikilink") jeans
were also popular in the 1980s with most [heavy
metal](Heavy_metal_music "wikilink") bands, and in particular those in
the [thrash metal](thrash_metal "wikilink") scene, such as
[Anthrax](Anthrax_(American_band) "wikilink"),
[Megadeth](Megadeth "wikilink"), [Metallica](Metallica "wikilink") and
[Slayer](Slayer "wikilink"). This was the trend for those who did not
wear [spandex](spandex "wikilink"), which was popular with the dominant
heavy metal scene at the time. They were often worn with white [high-top
sneakers](high-top "wikilink") or basketball shoes like
[Converse](Converse_(shoe_company) "wikilink"). By the late 1980s,
drainpipe pants were largely superseded by [straight leg
jeans](straight_leg_jeans "wikilink") like [Levi
501s](Levi_501 "wikilink"), but remained popular among fans of [hard
rock](hard_rock "wikilink") until the 1990s. Tight fitting jeans were
also worn by pop stars like [Michael
Jackson](Michael_Jackson "wikilink") and [Freddie
Mercury](Freddie_Mercury "wikilink").

### The 1990s

By the early [1990s](1990s_fashion "wikilink"), many glam metal bands
such as [Poison](Poison_(American_band) "wikilink"), [Mötley
Crüe](Mötley_Crüe "wikilink"), [Kiss](Kiss_(band) "wikilink"), [Bon
Jovi](Bon_Jovi "wikilink"), and
[Slaughter](Slaughter_(band) "wikilink"), abandoned spandex and wore
form fitted jeans. Tight jeans were also worn by members of the [casual
subculture](casual_subculture "wikilink") from the late 80s until the
mid 90s, including [Ewan McGregor](Ewan_McGregor "wikilink") in
[Trainspotting](Trainspotting_(film) "wikilink").[10] However, with the
rise of [grunge](grunge "wikilink") and [hip-hop](hip-hop "wikilink")
music in the mid 1990s and the [post thrash](post_thrash "wikilink")
movement, drainpipe jeans quickly went out of fashion in favor of baggy
[carpenter jeans](carpenter_jeans "wikilink"), as worn by hip-hop/rap
acts such as [Kris Kross](Kris_Kross "wikilink"), [Another Bad
Creation](Another_Bad_Creation "wikilink"), and [Snoop
Dogg](Snoop_Dogg "wikilink"). Flared jeans also made a comeback from the
mid-1990s onward, furthering the move away from the drainpipe styles.

### 2000s

![](Scene_kids2.jpg "fig:Scene_kids2.jpg") wearing skinny jeans,
late-2000s\]\] The 2000s saw the continued rejection of slim-fitting
pants and jeans throughout the early and middle years in mainstream
fashion. However, in 2005, fitted pants were reintroduced to the
mainstream market for women. This new style of pants was called "skinny
jeans". During its first year, skinny jeans were only sold online, and
they were not available in stores. Initially, they were not well
received by the public, though there were some early adopters. It was
not until 2006 that skinny jeans gained more steam in fashion world, and
by this time skinny jeans were being sold at shopping malls.[11]
Throughout 2007[12] skinny jeans received more mainstream exposure as
fashion trends started moving away from the [bell
bottoms](bell-bottoms "wikilink") and [baggy
pants](wide_leg_jeans "wikilink") which had been dominant for the
previous 10 years.[13] Men's skinny jeans were introduced in 2008 and
became the norm by 2009.[14][15]

### 2010s

\]\] Skinny jeans first spread to men's fashion in 2008.[16] This has
continued into the 2010s, entering the mainstream fashion in 2011. Since
then, they have remained popular and eventually became one of the
decade's defining fashion pieces for both men and women. They have
become so popular that many men have expanded their wardrobe to include
tight fitting [chino trousers](chino_trousers "wikilink") coming with
variety of colors, but often in khaki, brown or white.[17][18]

Women's skinny jeans saw the high-waist trend coming back in style. Like
men's, women's skinny jeans came in various colors, often in neutral
colors like khaki and white.

In Europe, skinny jeans for boys and men have a loose waist to appear
"baggy" at the top but skinny on the legs.

## Medical problems

Victorian doctors theorised that tight trousers caused an outbreak of
[apoplexy](apoplexy "wikilink") in New York. However, the veracity of
this claim is questionable, given the often speculative nature of early
modern medicine.[19]

In modern times, some physicians believe tight trousers may cause
numbness due to compression of [nerves](nerves "wikilink"). For example,
this may affect the outer thigh in the condition [meralgia
paraesthetica](meralgia_paraesthetica "wikilink").[20]

A recent study by Korean doctors suggests that skinny jeans can cause
[varicose veins](varicose_veins "wikilink").[21] Among men, tight
trousers may also cause [dyspermia](dyspermia "wikilink") due to
overheating of the [testes](testes "wikilink").[22]

A study in 2015 documented the case of skinny jeans causing
[rhabdomyolysis](rhabdomyolysis "wikilink"), bilateral peroneal and
tibial neuropathies.[23]

## Religion

In the early and mid-2010s, some Middle Eastern
[Islamist](Islamist "wikilink") groups disapproved of tight trousers,
because they are considered immodest, overtly sexual, or a threat to
local traditions.[24][25] In [Saudi Arabia](Saudi_Arabia "wikilink"),
the police are instructed to arrest teenagers who dress this way because
the tight jeans are seen as [un-Islamic](un-Islamic "wikilink") and,
when worn by men, a sign of
[homosexuality](homosexuality "wikilink").[26] In the [Gaza
strip](Gaza_strip "wikilink"),
[Palestinian](Palestinian_people "wikilink") youths caught wearing
skinny jeans have been arrested and beaten by the
[Hamas](Hamas "wikilink") police.[27] In [Sudan](Sudan "wikilink") the
police have imprisoned and fined women for wearing tight trousers.[28]
In 2012, unknown individuals murdered between twelve and one hundred
people in Iraq. Among them were "[emos](emo "wikilink")" of both sexes
wearing tight clothes and emo hairstyles.[29] In the [Islamic State of
Iraq and the Levant](Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant "wikilink"),
offenders wearing tight jeans could face a ten-day imprisonment period
that could be extended indefinitely until they pass a test on an Islamic
course.[30]
