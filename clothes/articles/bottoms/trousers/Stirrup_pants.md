![](Steghose_gold1.JPG "fig:Steghose_gold1.JPG") **Stirrup pants** (or
stirrup leggings) are a type of close-fitting ladies' pant that tapers
at the ankle, similar to leggings, except that the material extends to a
band, or strap, that is worn under the arch of the foot to hold the pant
leg in place. The band of material is often elasticized to prevent the
material around the foot from tearing. Stirrup pants were originally
sportswear for women, and remain sportswear for horse riding and skiing.
However, they have come in and out of fashion during the 20th and early
21st centuries, peaking in popularity as street fashion during the
1980s.

## History

Stirrup pants were first worn as jodhpurs for horse riders. The purpose
of the strap under the foot was to hold the pant legs in place in the
boots of the rider. As ladies moved away from riding sidesaddle, they
began wearing riding breeches in the 1920s in a similar style to those
worn by men. By 1934, [Jodhpurs](Jodhpurs "wikilink") as riding pants
with foot straps were being advertised in the United States mail order
catalogue for [Sears](Sears "wikilink").[1] Horse riding breeches are
still made with an elastic foot strap in some designs. Stirrup pants for
skiing were introduced at the [1936 Winter Olympic
Games](1936_Winter_Olympic_Games "wikilink") in Germany.[2]

Stirrup stretch pants were a mainstay of ski wear for both men and women
during most of the 1960s and part of the 1970s. In the 1960s this style
was used for women's and girls' stirrup pants. They were popular for
several years as shown in clothing catalogs of the day, such as J.C.
Penny, Sears, and Montgomery Ward.

Stirrup pants became a popular casual fashion for women in Europe and
America from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. In 1985, Linda Pender
wrote in *Cincinnati Magazine* that stirrup pants were "being touted as
*the* wardrobe basic of the year, and *every*body is buying them". On
the one hand, the style was promoted as being "easy to wear" and giving
"most figures a long, lean line"; on the other hand, a salesclerk
pointed out to Pender that the style was not flattering unless the
wearer was "slim and fit".[3] Leggings in general became fashionable
streetwear during the 1980s, as did sweatshirts, leg warmers, and other
items that originated in sports and dance studios.[4]

From about 2010 on, stirrup pants, stretch or not, have become just
another style of pants for use by women and men for sports, running or
general wear.
