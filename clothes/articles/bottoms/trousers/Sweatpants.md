![](sweatpants.jpg "fig:sweatpants.jpg") **Sweatpants** are a
[casual](casual_attire "wikilink") variety of soft
[trousers](trousers "wikilink") intended for
[comfort](comfort "wikilink") or
[athletic](sportswear_(activewear) "wikilink") purposes, although they
are now worn in many different situations. In the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink"), [Australia](Australia "wikilink"),
[New Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink"), and [South
Africa](South_Africa "wikilink") they are known as
**[tracksuit](tracksuit "wikilink") bottoms** or **joggers**. In
[Australia](Australian_English "wikilink"), they are also commonly known
as**trackpants**, **trackies** or **tracky daks**.[1]

## History

The first pair of sweatpants was introduced in the 1920s by [Émile
Camuset](Émile_Camuset "wikilink"), the founder of [Le Coq
Sportif](Le_Coq_Sportif "wikilink"). These were simple knitted gray
[jersey](Jersey_(fabric) "wikilink") pants that allowed athletes to
stretch and run comfortably.[2]

## Design

Sweatpants are usually made from [cotton](cotton "wikilink") or
[polyester](polyester "wikilink"), often of a heavy knit. They often
have elastic in the [waistband](waistband "wikilink"), drawstrings, and
may or may not have pockets. Some sweatpants can also feature
elasticized cuffs at the [hem](hem "wikilink") of the leg. Sweatpants
are traditionally [ash gray](ash_gray "wikilink") in color but are now
available in most colors. Traditionally quite "baggy" and loose,
sweatpants are now also available in more form-fitting shapes; moreover,
they have flexibility and comfort.

## Culture

Once these practical pants were only worn for sporting events and at
home. Now, they are available in many fashionable styles and are worn in
a variety of public situations. Because of their comfort and fashion,
they have become a popular choice of clothing. Sweatpants may come from
many different materials and in many forms including thick and thin.
Sweatpants are sometimes associated with certain lifestyles such as [gym
culture](gym_culture "wikilink") or [hip-hop
culture](hip-hop_culture "wikilink").[3] This niche-specific perception
of sweatpants since the 1980s has at times resulted in extensive dress
code regulations with some outlets outright banning the wearing of
sweatpants on their premises; including some German cafes and a
substantial number of nightclubs worldwide.[4]

## Variations

![](Woman_fitness_training.JPEG "fig:Woman_fitness_training.JPEG") There
are many variations on sweatpants design that have evolved to define
their own categories of athletic pants. These variations include
*fashion pants*, *windpants*, *tearaway pants*, and *muscle pants*.

### Fashion pants

*Fashion pants* typically refers to [fashion](fashion "wikilink")
conscious [sportswear](sportswear_(activewear) "wikilink"). These pants
are often made from a variety of materials, like
[velvet](velvet "wikilink") or [satin](satin "wikilink"), and in many
color combinations or patterns. One distinguishing characteristic is
that fashion pants generally lack the elastic band at the ankles.

### Windpants

*Windpants* are similar to sweatpants but are lighter and shield the
wearer from cold [wind](wind "wikilink") rather than insulate. Windpants
are typically made of polyester or [nylon](nylon "wikilink"), with a
liner made of cotton or polyester. The nylon material's natural friction
against both itself and human legs makes "swooshing" sounds during
walking. Windpants often have zippers on each ankle, letting athletes
unzip the end of each leg, allowing the pants to be pulled over their
footwear.

###

*Tearaway pants*, also known as *breakaway pants*, *rip-off pants*, or
*popper pants* are closely related to windpants. Tearaway pants are
windpants with [snap fasteners](snap_fastener "wikilink") running the
length of both legs. The snaps allow athletes to remove their tearaway
pants in a timely manner to compete in some sports.
[Basketball](Basketball "wikilink") and [track and
field](track_and_field "wikilink") are the two sports most commonly
associated with tearaway pants.
