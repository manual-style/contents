![](Speedo_zwembroek-1.jpg "fig:Speedo_zwembroek-1.jpg") **Swim trunks**
are brief [shorts](shorts "wikilink"), loose-fitting or tight, worn for
sports, especially boxing, swimming, and track.[1][2]

When worn as a [swimsuit](swimsuit "wikilink"), trunks are often
referred to as *swimming trunks* or *bathing trunks* (or with the more
general term *[bathing suit](bathing_suit "wikilink")* or a synonym) and
are normally shorter than [board shorts](board_shorts "wikilink"), which
extend to the knees. Trunks are the most popular type of male swimsuit
in [North America](North_America "wikilink"). They vary in style and
design, though most are made of [nylon](nylon "wikilink") with a mesh
[lining](lining_(sewing) "wikilink") for quick drying.

## Other usage

In [British English](British_English "wikilink"), the term *trunks* is
used as in American English as described above, but it can also refer to
men's [underpants](underpants "wikilink") with legs that reach mid
thigh, alternatively called [boxer briefs](boxer_briefs "wikilink").[3]

In [American English](American_English "wikilink"), the term is
sometimes used to refer to [trunk hose](trunk_hose "wikilink"), defined
by the *Collins American English Dictionary* as "full, baggy breeches
reaching about halfway down the thigh, worn in the 16th and 17th
cent."[4]
