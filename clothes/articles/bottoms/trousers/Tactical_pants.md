**Tactical pants** are closely related to [cargo
pants](cargo_pants "wikilink"), but with some technical modifications,
and specially designed as everyday wear for a range of professions from
EMTs, [FBI](FBI "wikilink") and [SWAT Team](SWAT_Team "wikilink")
agents, law enforcement officers, and military and fire professionals.

These [pants](trousers "wikilink") were originally worn by mountain
climbers, but now are made in several different styles. Tactical pants
typically are solid in color, distinguishing them from cargo pants. Made
with lightweight materials (65% polyester and 35% poly cotton ripstop),
the belt loops are made thick enough to support a large belt to carry
the weight of a sidearm, [handcuffs](handcuffs "wikilink") or other
equipment. External knife pockets are common, and the double reinforced
seat and knees provide enhanced abrasion protection, with interior knee
slots ready to accept 6mm [neoprene](neoprene "wikilink") kneepads.

Various styles can be reinforced with bar-tacks, gussets, and certain
brands are even coated with [Teflon](Teflon "wikilink").
