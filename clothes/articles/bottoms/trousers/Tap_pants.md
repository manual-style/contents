![](Tap_pants_back.jpg "fig:Tap_pants_back.jpg") **Tap pants** are a
form of [lingerie](lingerie "wikilink") designed for women, also known
as side-cut shorts or dance shorts, and are similar to [French
knickers](French_knickers "wikilink") in appearance. As the name
implies, they are a type of [shorts](shorts "wikilink"), in that they
cover the pelvic area and the upper part of the upper legs.

Tap pants look much like track shorts, allow freedom of movement, and
can be worn as an outer garment over other types of underwear (e.g.,
[g-strings](g-string "wikilink")). However, most wearers may wear them
as innerwear or leisurewear with nothing underneath. From a distance,
one could mistakenly identify tap pants as a half slip.

## Name

The name "tap pants" originates from shorts worn by
[tap](Tap_dance "wikilink") dancers during the 1930s, while practicing
their routines.

## Materials and design

Tap pants are mostly manufactured using materials like lace, silk,
satin, polyester, rayon and cotton voile. Some pairs may be trimmed in
ruffles.

## Popularity

Tap pants have been losing popularity to slimmer versions of underwear
since the mid 20th century,[1] as loose undergarments do not mix with
figure-hugging dresses, and especially with
[pants](trousers "wikilink").
