**Walk shorts** are a men's garment, which was popular in [New
Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink") in the 1960s and 1970s as summer wear
for white-collar workers. Walk shorts typically end above the knee and
were traditionally worn with knee-high socks and leather shoes or
sandals.[1]

The shorts are thought to have had their origins with the baggy khaki
drill shorts worn by New Zealand soldiers serving in the Middle East in
World War II. In the 1950s, the [New Zealand Public Service
Association](New_Zealand_Public_Service_Association "wikilink") union
petitioned the State Services Commission to permit workers to wear
shorts. Eventually the commission permitted staff to wear shorts in
"white, grey or fawn", which was eventually relaxed to allow colour and
print fashions of the time.[2]

The walk short is no longer commonly worn in New Zealand, but is
considered an iconic item of [Kiwiana](Kiwiana "wikilink").[3]
