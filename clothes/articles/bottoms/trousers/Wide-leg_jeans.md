**Wide-leg jeans** or **baggy pants** are a style of
[clothing](clothing "wikilink") that were popular from the early to mid
2000s. The quintessential brand of "hip-hop" style wide leg
[jeans](jeans "wikilink") was [JNCO](JNCO "wikilink"), though other
youth and [ethnic](ethnic "wikilink") oriented clothing companies
manufacture them as well.

Historically, the cut of pants has varied by period. From the [1500s
until the early 17th century](1550–1600_in_fashion "wikilink"), very
loose fitting [breeches](breeches "wikilink") and
[hosen](hose_(clothing) "wikilink") were fashionable among the wealthy.
Frequently, these [galligaskins](galligaskins "wikilink"), [trunk
hose](trunk_hose "wikilink") and [Rhinegraves](Rhinegraves "wikilink")
had slits to reveal a contrasting fabric lining, and were paired with
short [doublet](Doublet_(clothing) "wikilink") or
[jerkin](Jerkin_(garment) "wikilink").[1] These were replaced with
[tighter breeches](tight_pants "wikilink") and
[justacorps](justacorps "wikilink") [frock coats](frock_coat "wikilink")
during the 1660s, which remained in fashion until long pantaloons[2]
were introduced during the 1788 [French
Revolution](French_Revolution "wikilink") and Georgian [Regency
era](Regency_era "wikilink"). Baggy [pantaloons](trousers "wikilink")
(named after [Pantalone](Pantalone "wikilink") from the
[Harlequinade](Harlequinade "wikilink")) were originally work clothing,
and were worn by urban French [Sans-Culottes](Sans-Culottes "wikilink")
seeking to distinguish themselves from the overdressed aristocratic
[fops](fop "wikilink") of the [Ancien Régime](Ancien_Régime "wikilink")
who wore tight knee breeches.[3]

In the Islamic World, loose fitting [harem
pants](harem_pants "wikilink") and the [shalwar
kameez](shalwar_kameez "wikilink") were traditionally worn for modesty.
These trousers remain typical everyday menswear in modern Iran,
Afghanistan and Kurdistan. Subsequent conflict between the Ottoman,
Russian and Holy Roman Empire resulted in the development of the
[European loose trousers](European_loose_trousers "wikilink") or
[Sharovary](Sharovary "wikilink") worn as [folk
costume](folk_costume "wikilink") in Greece, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland
and Ukraine. From the [Crimean War](Crimean_War "wikilink") until World
War I, French [Zouaves](Zouave "wikilink") were also issued baggy red
[pajama](pajama "wikilink") pants inspired by those worn by North
African and Turkish soldiers.

Beginning in the early 20th century, baggy pants began to gain
rebellious connotations. During the 1920s, wide [Oxford
bags](Oxford_bags "wikilink") were favored by the
[Hearties](Hearties "wikilink") of
[Oxford](Oxford_University "wikilink") and [Cambridge
University](Cambridge_University "wikilink") because they could be put
on over the [knickerbockers](Knickerbockers_(clothing) "wikilink") then
worn to play [rugby football](rugby_football "wikilink").[4] In the US
during the 1930s and 1940s, Black, Italian and Mexican [zoot
suiters](zoot_suit "wikilink"), [Pachuchos](Pachucho "wikilink") and
[hep cats](hep_cat "wikilink") wore very wide legged [high waisted
pants](high_waisted_pants "wikilink") to the dancehalls as a protest
against wartime rationing, and because it was easy for gang members to
conceal weapons beneath a baggy suit.[5][6] The popularity of baggy
pants among teenagers faded in the 1950s, when young members of the
[greaser subculture](greaser_subculture "wikilink") favored [drainpipe
jeans](drainpipe_jeans "wikilink").

### In modern fashion

In the 1970s [bell bottom](bell_bottom "wikilink") trousers were worn by
[hippies](hippies "wikilink") and [disco](disco "wikilink") fans,[7] but
modern-day baggy jeans originated in the [ghetto](ghetto "wikilink"),
where [African American](African_American "wikilink") children had to
wear [secondhand](secondhand "wikilink") clothes, often handed down from
an older sibling or cousin.

In the 1980s, baggy jeans entered mainstream fashion as the [Hammer
pants](Hammer_pants "wikilink") and [parachute
pants](parachute_pants "wikilink") worn by rappers to facilitate
[breakdancing](breakdancing "wikilink"). In the 1990s these jeans became
even baggier and were worn by [skaters](skater_(subculture) "wikilink"),
[hardcore punks](hardcore_punk "wikilink"),[8]
[ravers](rave "wikilink")[9] and [rappers](rapper "wikilink") to set
themselves apart from the skintight [acid wash](acid_wash "wikilink")
[drainpipe jeans](drainpipe_jeans "wikilink") worn by
[metalheads](Heavy_metal_subculture "wikilink").[10] They were largely
an underground trend in the early 1990s, but took off in popularity in
the mid-1990s. The baggy jeans were very popular along with baggy
[bondage pants](bondage_pants "wikilink") during the [nu
metal](nu_metal "wikilink") era which lasted from the late 90s to the
early-to-mid 2000s.They continued to be popular in the 2000s, but by
2003 baggy jeans started to be replaced by [boot-cut jeans and
trousers](bell-bottoms "wikilink") among white men.[11] However, they
continued to be popular among African-American and Latino men throughout
the mid 2000s until about 2008.

In the United Kingdom, during the 1990s fad they were known as
"baggies". However, this term faded with the original fad and now they
are generally known as "wide-leg jeans".

In the late 2000s, Rap stars like [Kanye West](Kanye_West "wikilink")
popularised a more refined
[indie](Independent_music "wikilink")-inspired look but baggy jeans
continue to be worn by the raver and [gangsta
rap](gangsta_rap "wikilink") subcultures.

## Dimensions

Wide-leg jeans and pants are at least 20" in circumference at the hem.
Wide-leg jeans differ from [bell-bottoms](bell-bottoms "wikilink") in
that the entire length of the leg is large in circumference whereas
flare or bell-bottom jeans become wider below the knee. Wide-leg jeans
can be considered to be a variant of baggy jeans, which were also
popular in the 1990s.

Super wide-leg jeans have a circumference at the hem of 23" to 26";
whereas, extreme wide-leg jeans are as wide as 50".[12]
