**Yoga pants** are form-fitting [trousers](trousers "wikilink") designed
for [yoga as exercise](yoga_as_exercise "wikilink") and first sold in
1998 by [Lululemon](Lululemon "wikilink"), a company founded for that
purpose. They were initially made of a mix of [nylon](nylon "wikilink")
and [Lycra](Lycra "wikilink"); more specialised fabrics have been
introduced to provide [moisture-wicking](moisture-wicking "wikilink"),
[compression](Compression_fabric "wikilink"), and odour reduction.

The market has increased both through the popularity of yoga and because
many women wear yoga pants as casual everyday dress, continuing a
long-term trend of increasing informality in dress, threatening sales of
traditional [jeans](jeans "wikilink"). The use of yoga pants for more
formal and office wear has been criticised by [Karl
Lagerfeld](Karl_Lagerfeld "wikilink") and others.

In the United States, the wearing of yoga pants other than for exercise
has aroused controversy, both for school use and when worn by women.
Sales of [athleisure](athleisure "wikilink") clothing have all the same
grown rapidly, reaching some $48 billion by 2018.

## Origins

[Yoga](Yoga_as_exercise "wikilink") became a popular form of exercise
across the Western world by the 1990s, especially for women.[1]

Yoga pants made of [nylon](nylon "wikilink") and
[Lycra](Lycra "wikilink") appeared on the market in 1998, sold by
[Lululemon](Lululemon "wikilink") in its first store in
[Vancouver](Vancouver "wikilink") as suitable attire for the yoga
studio.[2][3] Lululemon's founder, [Chip
Wilson](Chip_Wilson "wikilink"), is said to have attended a yoga class
in 1997 where the instructor was wearing "slinky dance attire" that
fitted like a second skin, reportedly inspiring him to found his yoga
fashion business.[4] In 2005 Lululemon introduced a stretch fabric
(Luon) with more nylon microfibre and less
[polyester](polyester "wikilink"), followed by several more specialised
fabrics: a four-way stretch
[moisture-wicking](moisture-wicking "wikilink") fabric (Luxtreme), a
[compression fabric](compression_fabric "wikilink") (Nulux), and an
odour-reducing fabric containing silver as an
[antibacterial](antibacterial "wikilink") (Silverescent).[5] Yoga pants
increased in popularity, to the point where by 2014 American teenagers
preferred them to [jeans](jeans "wikilink"); the jeans manufacturer
[Levi Strauss](Levi_Strauss "wikilink"), threatened with "an existential
crisis",[6] was obliged to make some of its jeans stretchy.[7] Yoga
pants took some years to spread around the world; the first Lululemon
store in Europe opened in 2014, in London's [Covent
Garden](Covent_Garden "wikilink").[8]

Numerous competitors entered the market, some of them like
[Nike](Nike,_Inc. "wikilink"), [Adidas](Adidas "wikilink"), and
[Target](Target_Corporation "wikilink") also offering specialised
fabrics.[9]

## Types

Many styles and brands of yoga pants are available at a wide range of
prices,[10] determined primarily by brand: in 2015, a high-end pair from
the specialist retailer Lululemon cost $98, whereas an "unfamiliar"
brand sold by the general retailer Target cost $20.[11] By 2018, there
were over 11,000 types, according to
[Bloomberg](Bloomberg_News "wikilink"), with a style by Lucas High on
sale for as much as $230.[12]

Styles include the traditional [boot-cut](:wikt:boot_cut "wikilink") and
flared yoga pants with a flat [waistband](waistband "wikilink").[13]
Basic yoga pants are black, tight-fitted, boot-cut, flared, and
reversible; they are made of a four way stretch fabric, with a flat
elastic waistband at the top. They provide flexibility and comfort,
wicking moisture away from the body and helping to keep the wearer cool
and comfortable. They may be made from blends of cotton, lycra
[spandex](spandex "wikilink"), [nylon](nylon "wikilink"),
[polyester](polyester "wikilink"), wool, or similar light and [stretchy
synthetic material](stretch_fabric "wikilink") giving the pants a soft,
smooth finish.[14][15]

## Usage

![](Naam_Yoga_LA_Class.jpg "fig:Naam_Yoga_LA_Class.jpg") are wearing
yoga pants; others wear shorts or tracksuit bottoms.\]\]

Yoga pants have migrated from the yoga studio to the high street; from
the early 2010s, they have increasingly been used as everyday casual
wear.[16][17] Women wear them around the house, as maternity wear, and
for dancing and going to clubs.[18][19] Yoga pants have even been
adopted as office wear; in 2014, [Betabrand](Betabrand "wikilink")'s
"[dress pant](Dress_pants "wikilink") yoga pants" became its bestselling
product.[20] *[Fortune](Fortune_(magazine) "wikilink")* suggested that
these could be paired with [high-heeled
shoes](high-heeled_shoe "wikilink") and a smart
[blouse](blouse "wikilink") to help them fit in.[21] Jessica Grose,
writing in *[Slate](Slate_(magazine) "wikilink")*, responded that
whatever was done to yoga pants to make them look more like dress pants
(business suit trousers), they were still
[leggings](leggings "wikilink").[22] Suzanne Wexler, writing in *[The
Vancouver Sun](The_Vancouver_Sun "wikilink")*, agreed, calling yoga
pants with heels and blouse "a fashion [faux
pas](wikt:faux_pas "wikilink")".[23] *[The
Atlantic](The_Atlantic "wikilink")* however suggested, based on a
preliminary 2012 study of "enclothed cognition", that wearing active
clothing might encourage people to exercise more.[24][25]

The fashion historian Amanda Hallay noted that women want to look as if
they are running to the gym, whether they are or not.[26] Another
fashion historian, Deirdre Clemente, states that
[athleisure](athleisure "wikilink") clothing arrived when three trends
came together: the technical improvement of fibres to create strong,
long-lasting and flexible materials such as
[spandex](spandex "wikilink"); a Western fascination for appearing
extremely healthy; and the decline of formality in clothing, allowing
yoga clothing to blend into office wear. In Clemente's view, all three
of these trends developed slowly throughout the 20th century.[27] By
2019, yoga pants had become normal attire in Europe as in North America;
the UK's *[The Sun](The_Sun_(United_Kingdom) "wikilink")* noted that
yoga pants were "pretty much acceptable" at work, for lunch, and for a
date as much as for yoga.[28]

Demand for comfortable active, athletic, sports and casual wear has
increased since the turn of the 21st century.[29] [Nike,
Inc.](Nike,_Inc. "wikilink") reported their women's business comprised
$7 billion in 2010.[30] The larger [athleisure](athleisure "wikilink")
market grew to $33.6 billion by 2015,[31] and $48 billion by 2018.[32]
Nike claims the driving factor has been the demand for fashionable and
flattering workout gear.[33] New colours, patterns, and structural
designs have created more versatility and increased the wearing of yoga
pants in public settings. Author Mae Anderson, writing in the *[Denver
Post](Denver_Post "wikilink")* in 2013, called yoga pants the "new
[jeans](jeans "wikilink")".[34] Hollie Shaw, writing in the *[Financial
Post](Financial_Post "wikilink")* in 2015, noted the "Lululemon
effect"[35] which had replaced jeans with yoga pants, despite hostile
remarks about the style from [Karl
Lagerfeld](Karl_Lagerfeld "wikilink"), and observed that men too were
starting to wear them instead of [denim](denim "wikilink").[36] By 2018,
yoga pants were starting to be worn by men, with or without a pair of
shorts on top.[37]

## Social issues

In the United States, the wider adoption of yoga pants proved
controversial for schools.[38] Some schools adopted [dress
codes](dress_codes "wikilink") banning yoga pants for all students, or
banning them only for female students.[39][40][41]
*[Bitch](Bitch_(magazine) "wikilink")* magazine argued such bans are
largely gendered, focusing on the damage caused by supposed
"distraction" of boys by girls in tight clothing;[42] similar complaints
caused a ban in [Rockport,
Massachusetts](Rockport,_Massachusetts "wikilink"), quickly
reversed.[43] In Montana, a 2015 bill supposedly sought to outlaw both
yoga pants and leggings,[44] but the representative concerned, David
Moore, claimed that this had been a joke.[45]

The tight-fitting nature of yoga pants for adult women has also aroused
discussion. In *[The Atlantic](The_Atlantic "wikilink")* in 2014,
Rosalie Murphy criticized the glossy yoga magazines such as *[Yoga
Journal](Yoga_Journal "wikilink")* which always featured a shapely
[female yoga practitioner](Women_in_yoga "wikilink") in tight yoga pants
and [tank top](tank_top "wikilink"), "stretching her arms toward the sky
or closing her eyes in [meditation](meditation "wikilink")."[46] [*Time*
magazine](Time_magazine "wikilink") recorded that in 2016, a man in
Rhode Island wrote to a local newspaper calling the wearing of yoga
pants by women "bizarre and disturbing"; in response, hundreds of
[demonstrators](Demonstration_(political) "wikilink") in tight clothing
assembled in front of his house.[47] All the same, in 2017, [United
Airlines](United_Airlines "wikilink") prevented two "girls" from flying
from Denver to Minneapolis as their leggings did not meet the [dress
code](dress_code "wikilink").[48]

In a *[New York Times](New_York_Times "wikilink")* opinion piece, Honor
Jones argued that yoga pants were bad for women, stating that women were
wearing yoga pants because of social pressure to be "sexy", and urged
women to wear shape-concealing [sweatpants](sweatpants "wikilink")
instead.[49] Anne Kingston disagreed with Jones, writing in
*[Maclean's](Maclean's "wikilink")* in 2018 that a looser style of
sweatpants had already re-entered athleisure fashion, and that there
were solid practical reasons for tight yoga pants, such as that they
make it easier for instructors and students to check their body
alignment, reducing the risk of injury.[50]
