**Adidas Kampung** is a generic name for cheap black
[rubber](rubber "wikilink") shoes that are usually made in
[Malaysia](Malaysia "wikilink"). Being made 100% out of rubber, they are
waterproof, easy to dry, and thus ideal for trekking in tropical
weather.[1] They gained attention in the blogosphere when they were
featured as having been used by local climbers to win various
climbathons such as the [Mount Kinabalu International
Climbathon](Mount_Kinabalu_International_Climbathon "wikilink") held in
[Sabah](Sabah "wikilink").[2][3] One particular model comes with four
yellow stripes and studded soles, and is commonly used by villagers to
play [football](association_football "wikilink"). Its similarities to
the famed stripes on [Adidas](Adidas "wikilink") shoes earned it the
moniker Adidas [Kampung](Kampung "wikilink"), or the Village Adidas.

Adidas Kampungs are easily found in sundry shops in the villages of
Malaysia for under RM10.00.
