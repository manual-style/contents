![](Three_Different_Aglets.jpg "fig:Three_Different_Aglets.jpg") An
**aglet** ( )[1] is a small sheath, often made of plastic or metal, used
on each end of a [shoelace](shoelace "wikilink"), a
[cord](Rope "wikilink"), or a [drawstring](drawstring "wikilink").[2] An
aglet keeps the fibers of the lace or cord from unraveling; its firmness
and narrow profile make it easier to hold and easier to feed through
[eyelets](Grommet "wikilink"), lugs, or other lacing guides.

## Etymology

The word *aglet* or *aiglet* comes from the [Old
French](Old_French "wikilink") word *aiguillette*, the diminutive of
*aiguille*, meaning "needle", which is in turn derived from the Latin
word for a needle, *acus*.[3]

## History

Aglets were originally made of metal, glass, or stone,[4] and many were
very ornamental. Wealthy people in the [Roman
era](Ancient_Rome "wikilink") would have their aglets made out of
precious metals such as brass or silver.

Before the invention of [buttons](Button_(clothing) "wikilink"), they
were used on the ends of the [ribbons](ribbon "wikilink") used to fasten
clothing together. Sometimes they were formed into small figures.
[Shakespeare](William_Shakespeare "wikilink") calls this type of figure
an "aglet baby" in *[The Taming of the
Shrew](The_Taming_of_the_Shrew "wikilink")*.

According to *Huffington Post* editor James Cave, "The history of the
aglet’s evolution is a little knotty—many sources credit it as being
popularized by an English inventor named Harvey Kennedy who is said to
have earned $2.5 million off the modern shoelace in the 1790s."[5]

Today, the clear plastic aglets on the end of shoelaces are put there by
special machines. The machines wrap plastic tape around the end of new
shoelaces and use heat or chemicals to melt the plastic onto the
shoelace and bond the plastic to itself.[6]

## Variety

There is a subtle distinction between aglets, which are generally
functional, and [aiguillettes](aiguillette "wikilink"), which are
generally decorative. Aiguillettes usually appear at the end of
decorative cords, such as [bolo ties](bolo_tie "wikilink") and the cords
on military dress uniforms.

Shoe companies often produce their own shoelaces, for which they
manufacture aglets. Many companies prefer to add metal sheaths over
plastic aglets for better durability. Some may add logos or pictures.[7]
