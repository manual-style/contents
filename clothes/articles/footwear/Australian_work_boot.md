elastic sided boots\]\] An **Australian work boot** (or generically
**elastic-sided boot**) is a style of work shoe, typically constructed
with a [leather](leather "wikilink") upper bound together with
[elastic](Elastomer "wikilink") sides and pull tabs on the front and
back of the boot. The shoe lacks a tongue, and
[laces](shoelaces "wikilink"), and often contains a steel toe cap for
[occupational health and
safety](occupational_health_and_safety "wikilink") reasons. When the
shoe contains a steel cap they are often known as "[safety
boots](safety_boots "wikilink")" or "[steel toe
boots](steel_toe_boots "wikilink")". The boots generally lack an inner
lining. The sole is generally [polyurethane](polyurethane "wikilink")
and the leather uppers are treated to be resistant to hot water, fats
and mild alkaline and acid solutions.

The elasticated side design, originally invented in England by Joseph
Sparkes Hall in 1837,[1] allows the wearer to put on or remove their
boots without the hassle of laces, while enjoying the firm fit of
lace-up boots. The original English design, for urban use, became known
as the [Chelsea Boot](Chelsea_Boot "wikilink") in the 1960s. In 1932
R.M. Williams adapted this design for stockmen's boots.[2] There are
several Australian companies manufacturing boots in this classic style
today. Some of the more popular brands are
[Blundstone](Blundstone_Footwear "wikilink") (perhaps the original
dating back to 1870),[3] [Rossi Boots](Rossi_Boots "wikilink")
(established in 1910 and still manufactured in Australia), [R. M.
Williams](R._M._Williams_(company) "wikilink"), [Baxter
Boots](Baxter_Boots "wikilink")[4] [Redback
Boots](Redback_Boots "wikilink"), and Mongrel Boots (Victor Footwear,
manufacturing in Australia since 1930). In [Australian
English](Australian_English "wikilink"), the manufacturer's brand name
is often associated generically with this style of boot, leading to the
names *Blundstones*, *RMs* or *Rossis*.

The shoes are typically worn as safety boots in occupationally hazardous
environments, as ordinary work boots for people whose work is
occasionally hazardous and who need to enter hazardous sites. Because of
the hazardous conditions of Australia with life-threatening reptile
fauna, the defending capabilities of the boots served as the inspiration
for modern snake anti-bite boots.[5] Australian boots were also used as
formal dress boots, as riding boots, or for particular aesthetic
purposes. In the last category, the
[Novocastrian](Newcastle,_NSW "wikilink") dance ensemble *[Tap
Dogs](Tap_Dogs "wikilink")* uses modified work boots as tap shoes.
