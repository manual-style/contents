The **avarca** (, plural ) is a type of sandal popular in the [Balearic
Islands](Balearic_Islands "wikilink") (Spain), especially
[Menorca](Menorca "wikilink"). The shoes are made using a leather upper
and a rubber sole.[1] Avarca is a traditional sandal originally
developed in Menorca in the Balearic Islands. They were originally made
from a leather upper and with the sole made from a recycled car
[tyre](Tire "wikilink"). Nowadays however the soles are made in the
style of a car tire but from a purpose made mould. These are hard
wearing and much lighter in weight than the original car tire sole. Only
original avarca manufacturers are granted with the label " Avarca de
Menorca ". This label is granted by local Government and guarantees that
avarcas accomplishes minimum quality standards and avarcas are really
manufactured in Menorca island.
