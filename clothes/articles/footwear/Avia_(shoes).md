![](Black_avia_shoes.jpg "fig:Black_avia_shoes.jpg") **Avia** is an
American [footwear](footwear "wikilink") and
[clothing](clothing "wikilink") company that specializes in running,
yoga and lifestyle activewear, shoes and accessories. Avia was founded
in 1979 by Jerry Stubblefield, and is currently a subsidiary of the
[Sequential Brands Group](Sequential_Brands_Group "wikilink").

## History

Avia was founded in Oregon in 1979 by Jerry Stubblefield.[1][2]
Stubblefield reportedly came up with the word "avia" (derived from the
Latin "*avis*", meaning "bird"[3][4]) while on a jet flight, and decided
to use it as a brand name for a sports shoe to suggest aviation. Jerry
Stubblefield and his son Don Stubblefield developed shoe designs that
revolutionized athletic footwear. The father-and-son tandem created
designs such as the widely imitated cantilever sole, which helped make
Avia an industry leader. In 1987, Avia was acquired by
[Reebok](Reebok "wikilink") for $180 million,[5] which later sold it to
the [American Sporting Goods
Corporation](American_Sporting_Goods_Corporation "wikilink") in the
later-1990s.[6][7] Avia has since been acquired by the Sequential Brands
Group in the Galaxy Brands deal in 2014.[8]

## Products

Avia made its name as a leading brand in the 1980s for its line of
women's walking and aerobics shoes, as well as men's shoes. In the late
1980s and early 1990s, Avia had a thriving line of basketball shoes;
among those who wore Avia were [Scottie
Pippen](Scottie_Pippen "wikilink"), [John
Stockton](John_Stockton "wikilink"), [John
Salley](John_Salley "wikilink"), [AC Green](AC_Green "wikilink"), and
[Clyde Drexler](Clyde_Drexler "wikilink").[9] Avia shoes are known for
their performance, durability and comfort.[10] Former [Louisiana State
University](Louisiana_State_University "wikilink") Football [head
coach](head_coach "wikilink") [Les Miles](Les_Miles "wikilink") wears
Avia shoes while on the sidelines of every game.

The company is also known for some of the performance technologies built
into their shoes, including the Cantilever Heel (heel support), the ARC
â€“ Anatomical Rebound Cradle (comprehensive foot cushioning and arch
support), and Avia's FOM technology (shock compression).[11]

In 1991, Avia filed a lawsuit against Nike, alleging that Nike's ''Air
180'' and ''Air Force 180'' running and basketball shoes infringed upon
Avia patents. Avia accused Nike of pirating its ''Cantilever''
technology, which uses a cushion to provide shock absorption and
stability. The company contended the technology has been the basis of
its products since Avia was founded in 1980. Avia widened the suit in
January 1992[12] and settled in December 1992.[13]

Avia introduced its line of performance and lifestyle activewear in
2013, building upon its continued success within the active category,
and later came out with wearable technology in 2015.[14]
