**Ballet flats**, **Dolly shoes**, or simply **flats**, are similar
to/inspired by a woman's [ballet shoe](ballet_shoe "wikilink"), with a
very thin heel or the appearance of no heel at all. The style sometimes
features a ribbon-like binding around the low tops of the slipper and
may have a slight gathering at the top-front of the
[vamp](Shoe#Vamp,_or_upper "wikilink") ([toe box](toe_box "wikilink"))
and sometimes a tiny, decorative string tie. Ballet slippers can be
adjusted and tightened to the wearer's [foot](foot "wikilink") by means
of this string tie.

Ballet flats are especially popular for women and girls of all ages,
being worn as a fashion trend and as a more comfortable alternative to
high heels with everything from casual wear to formal wear and
everything in between from jeans, shorts, skirt, dresses, shortalls, and
leggings. They now come in a wide range of styles and colors including
the popular black ballet flat either plain or with a shoe string bow or
other decoration at the upper toe part of the shoe.[1][2][3][4] Not all
but a number of school allow ballet flats as part of the uniform
requirements and many school bands require ballet flats in black as part
of the dress requirements for performances.[5][6][7][8][9]

## History

The essence of the ballet flat has existed since at least the 16th
century, when men wore a similar shoe, then known as
[pompes](Court_shoe "wikilink"). In medieval times ballet flats were
popular with both men and women. They only went out of fashion in the
17th and 18th centuries when the [high-heeled
shoe](high-heeled_shoe "wikilink") came into fashion after [Catherine
de' Medici](Catherine_de'_Medici "wikilink") requested that her
[cobbler](shoemaking "wikilink") add 5 cm (2 inches) to her wedding
shoes. Heels went out of fashion quickly after [Marie
Antoinette](Marie_Antoinette "wikilink") walked to the
[guillotine](guillotine "wikilink") in a pair of heels. Functional shoes
– [sandals](sandals "wikilink"), [boots](boots "wikilink"), and flat
shoes – prevailed in the 19th century. Ballet flats took off again when
[Audrey Hepburn](Audrey_Hepburn "wikilink") wore them with cigarette
pants in *[Funny Face](Funny_Face "wikilink")* in 1957.

In 1947, [Rose Repetto](Rose_Repetto "wikilink") hand stitched her first
ballet flat for her son, famous dancer and choreographer, [Roland
Petit](Roland_Petit "wikilink"). Once actress [Brigitte
Bardot](Brigitte_Bardot "wikilink") donned a pair of Repetto's flats,
variations of ballet flats became wildly popular and returned as a
fashion trend.[10] They are also often referred to as **ballet pumps**
or **ballet sneakers** and designed for outdoor wear, using a variety of
fabrics and usually with a rubber sole.
