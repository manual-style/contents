## History

![](C._F._Bally_AG_1907.jpg "fig:C._F._Bally_AG_1907.jpg") Bally was
founded by Carl Franz Bally and his brother Fritz in the basement of
their family home in [Schönenwerd](Schönenwerd "wikilink") in the
[Canton of Solothurn](Canton_of_Solothurn "wikilink"), Switzerland. The
original family business was the manufacture of elastic ribbon.

During a business trip to [Paris](Paris "wikilink") in 1849, Carl Franz
wanted to buy his wife some lace-up booties - the popular shoe of the
day. Unable to recall her exact size, he decided to buy twelve pairs in
a range of sizes, knowing that one would certainly fit. Upon visiting
the Parisian factory where the booties were made, he noticed that each
shoe featured buttons with elastic closures similar to the kind his
family produced in Switzerland. Inspired by the possibility of creating
more jobs and improving the lives of local residents, he decided to
expand his business into shoe production. Together with his brother
Fritz, Carl Franz employed designers to assist and together, they began
producing shoes made entirely by hand in the cellar of his Schönenwerd
home.

The Bally Company was established in Schönenwerd in 1851 and three years
later, the first factory located in the village centre was built. In
1854, Fritz Bally retired. By the 1870s, Bally was recognised as a
footwear industry leader. The company’s name changed to C. F. Bally, and
then to C. F. Bally & Sons when the brand’s founding pioneer handed the
company reins to his sons in 1892. Carl Franz died in 1899 but
undeniably passed on his pioneering spirit to his sons. Bally grew
internationally and opened stores in Geneva, in [Buenos
Aires](Buenos_Aires "wikilink") (1873), followed by Paris (1879) and
London (1882). In the 1980s, Bally was also one of the very first
European [luxury goods](luxury_goods "wikilink") brands to open in
post-[reform and opening](reform_and_opening "wikilink") China. By now
the brand had also extended its offering to include clothing, handbags
and [leather](leather "wikilink") goods for both men and women (1976),
and in 1990 would become truly global, opening in Japan, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Lebanon and
Turkey. [2]

Bally is currently under the leadership of CEO Frédéric de Narp
(November,2013), with Pablo Coppola as Design Director (February, 2014)
and [parent company](parent_company "wikilink") JAB Holdings at the
helm.

In 2008 TPG Capital sold Bally International AG to Vienna, Austria-based
Labelux Group, a luxury goods holding firm which also owns [Jimmy Choo
Ltd](Jimmy_Choo_Ltd "wikilink"). and was founded by the German
billionaire Reimann family as part of the family’s investment arm [Joh
A. Benckiser](JAB_Holding_Company "wikilink").[3]

Headquartered in [Caslano](Caslano "wikilink"), Ticino, Switzerland, the
company announced that [Frédéric de Narp](Frédéric_de_Narp "wikilink"),
a former executive at [Harry Winston](Harry_Winston "wikilink"), would
become its chief executive officer in November 2013.[4][5] In February
2018 owner [JAB Holding Company](JAB_Holding_Company "wikilink") agreed
to sell a majority controlling stake to Chinese materials conglomerate
[Shandong Ruyi](Shandong_Ruyi "wikilink").[6]

## Bally House

Bally House in Schönenwerd has been built by architect Karl Moser. As
most of the employees of Bally factory were coming from the nearby
villages and had a longer working way, it was important for the owners
to provide the possibility of healthy food. At first a small cantine was
built in 1879, and then in 1915 it was decided to build a bigger
building in the middle of the park.

Karl Moser has built a two-story classic building that included cantine
for the employees, as well as the rooms for the employees, showers and
bathrooms. Among the people the house was named Parkhotel.

Nowadays the building and the park around is under the protection of
canton and is being used for different events.[13]
