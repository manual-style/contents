![](Lapti.png "fig:Lapti.png") **Bast shoes** are
[shoes](shoe "wikilink") made primarily from
[bast](bast_(biology) "wikilink") — fiber taken from the
[bark](Bark_(botany) "wikilink") of trees such as
[linden](Tilia "wikilink") or [birch](birch "wikilink"). They are a kind
of basket, woven and fitted to the shape of a foot. Bast shoes are an
obsolete traditional [footwear](footwear "wikilink") of the forest areas
of [Northern Europe](Northern_Europe "wikilink"), formerly worn by
poorer members of the [Finnic
peoples](Baltic_Finnic_peoples "wikilink"), [Balts](Balts "wikilink"),
[Russians](Russians "wikilink") and
[Belarussians](Belarussians "wikilink"). They were easy to manufacture,
but not durable.

Bast shoes have been worn since prehistoric times. Wooden foot-shaped
blocks (lasts) for shaping them have been found in
[neolithic](neolithic "wikilink") excavations, e.g. 4900 years old.[1]
Bast shoes were still worn in the Russian countryside at the beginning
of the twentieth century. Today bast shoes are sold as souvenirs and
sometimes worn by ethnographic music or dance troupes as part of their
costume.

![](MuzhikLapti.jpg "fig:MuzhikLapti.jpg") depicting a peasant making
lapti (Russian bast shoes).\]\] In
[Russian](Russian_language "wikilink"), they are called **lapti**
(*лапти*, sing. *[лапоть](wikt:лапоть "wikilink")*, **lapot**); this
word is used as a derogatory term for cheap and short-lived
[footwear](footwear "wikilink") and, in the form *lapotnik*
(*лапотник*), also for an uneducated person, notionally one who is too
poor to afford good shoes and wears bast shoes instead. The [MiG-105
"Spiral"](Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-105 "wikilink")
[spaceplane](spaceplane "wikilink") was nicknamed *Lapot* for the shape
of its nose.

Bast shoes played an important role in the [founding
myth](founding_myth "wikilink") of [Přemyslid
dynasty](Přemyslid_dynasty "wikilink"), which reigned in
[Bohemia](Bohemia "wikilink") and [Moravia](Moravia "wikilink") until
1306 AD. [Přemysl the Ploughman](Přemysl_the_Ploughman "wikilink"), its
legendary ancestor, was a peasant of humble origin. His bast shoes and
bast-bag were kept as relics at [Vyšehrad](Vyšehrad "wikilink") and
Czech kings put them on during their coronations. The relics probably
were destroyed when Vyšehrad fell to [Hussites](Hussites "wikilink") in
1420.
