A **Beatle boot** is a style of boot that has been worn since the
[1960s](1960s_in_fashion "wikilink")—made popular by the English rock
group [the Beatles](the_Beatles "wikilink"), for whom they were
originally made. The boots are a variant of the [Chelsea
boot](Chelsea_boot "wikilink"): they are tight-fitting,
[Cuban-heeled](High-heeled_footwear#Men_and_heels "wikilink"),
ankle-high boots with a sharp pointed toe. The style can feature either
elastic or zipped sides.[1]

Beatle boots saw the reintroduction of [high-heeled
footwear](high-heeled_footwear "wikilink") for men.[2]

## History

![](The_Beatles_i_Hötorgscity_1963.jpg "The_Beatles_i_Hötorgscity_1963.jpg")

Beatle boots are a direct descendant of the [Chelsea
boot](Chelsea_boot "wikilink"), but have an even more pointed toe and a
centre seam stitch running from ankle to toe, and the [flamenco
boot](Flamenco_shoe "wikilink"), from which its Cuban heel was
derived.[3] Beatle boots originated in October 1961, when English
musicians [John Lennon](John_Lennon "wikilink") and [Paul
McCartney](Paul_McCartney "wikilink") saw Chelsea boots whilst browsing
in the London footwear company [Anello &
Davide](Anello_&_Davide "wikilink"), and consequently commissioned four
pairs (with the addition of Cuban heels) for the Beatles, to complement
their new suit image upon their [return from
Hamburg](The_Beatles_in_Hamburg "wikilink").[4]

Beatle boots were very popular with rock bands and artists during the
middle 1960s but started to decline during the 1970s. The boots saw a
surge of popularity during the punk movement in the late 1970s and early
1980s but again started to decline throughout the 1990s. During the late
2000s and early 2010s the boots have seen a steady surge in popularity.
