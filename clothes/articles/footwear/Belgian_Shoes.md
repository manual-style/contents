**Belgian Shoes** are a variety of handstitched loafer, manufactured in
[Izegem, Belgium,](Izegem "wikilink") a historic centre of the nation's
shoe industry. The shoes are known for their small bow near the top of
the vamp.

## History

The shoes were designed by Henri Bendel, the nephew of [Henri
Bendel](Henri_Willis_Bendel "wikilink"), the founder of the eponymous
[New York boutique](Henri_Bendel "wikilink"). When the Bendel family
sold the family's department store in 1955, Bendel established the
Belgian Shoes boutique at 60 East 56th Street, Manhattan,[1] before
moving to the current address at 110 East 55th Street in 2001.[2]

## Clients

Belgian Shoes have been traditionally considered a status symbol among
the Upper East Side and Hamptons social set, but have in the past
several years become more widely worn.[3] As early as the 1960s the shoe
was considered notable as signifying a resistance to prevailing fashion
trends[4], and there have been few significant changes to the range
since then.[5] Notable wearers of the shoe include [Isaac
Mizrahi](Isaac_Mizrahi "wikilink")[6] and [Bernie
Madoff](Bernie_Madoff "wikilink").[7]

## Awards

For his efforts in reviving the Belgian shoe industry through the design
and sale of the shoe, the Belgian government awarded Bendel the [Knight
of the Order of Leopold the
First](Order_of_Leopold_(Belgium) "wikilink") in 1964, and [Knight
Commander of the Order of Leopold the
Second](Order_of_Leopold_II "wikilink") in 1970.[8]
