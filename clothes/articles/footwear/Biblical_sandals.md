![](Biblical_sandals.JPG "fig:Biblical_sandals.JPG") **Biblical
sandals** (, *sandalim tanakhim*), also called **Tanakhi sandals** and
**Khugistic sandals** (, *sandalim ḥugistim*),[1] are
[sandals](sandals "wikilink") consisting of a
[sole](Sole_(shoe) "wikilink") with two [leather](leather "wikilink")
ligaments that pass across the [foot](foot "wikilink"), and one around
the [heel](heel "wikilink").[2] The leather is usually
[brown](brown "wikilink") or [black](black "wikilink"). The Biblical
sandals are the classic model of leading sandals manufacturers in
[Israel](Israel "wikilink").

## History

The source of Biblical sandals is ancient. They appear in [wall
paintings](wall_painting "wikilink") found in [archaeological
digs](archaeology "wikilink") dating the [Old
Testament](Old_Testament "wikilink") in the [Levant](Levant "wikilink")
and were not very different from those used in [Rome](Rome "wikilink")
and [Egypt](Egypt "wikilink"). Reminders of such sandals were found at
[Massada](Massada "wikilink") and the [Cave of
Letters](Cave_of_Letters "wikilink"). In ancient times those sandals
were made of non-processed leather and dry [grass](grass "wikilink"),
and had strings or ropes made of simple, cheap materials. Though,
sometimes [golden](gold "wikilink") or [silver](silver "wikilink")
[beads](bead "wikilink") and even [gems](Gemstone "wikilink") were
added.

In modern times, Biblical sandals are a symbol of
[Zionism](Zionism "wikilink"). Israeli pioneer
[settlers](settler "wikilink") and Israeli born [Jews](Jews "wikilink")
used them to show the return to the [clothing](cloth "wikilink") worn by
the ancestors and fit the climate. The harsh economic situation of the
Zionists before the establishment of Israel, and of the Israelis in the
1940s to the 1960s, including the [Austerity in
Israel](Austerity_in_Israel "wikilink") period, made those low-cost
sandals a part of the proud-poor country-side or
[kibbutz](kibbutz "wikilink") [fashion](fashion "wikilink").[3] The
style contrasted with the more ostentatious attire of the
[city](city "wikilink") inhabitants who were
[European](Europe "wikilink")-influenced. Later, the city inhabitants
started wearing these sandals too, especially after their popularization
by [Nimrod](:he:נעלי_נימרוד "wikilink") in Tel Aviv.[4]

Modern manufacturers known for making Biblical sandals include Nimrod,
[Shoresh](Source_Sandals "wikilink"), and [Teva
Naot](Naot "wikilink").[5] The sandals are also sometimes worn by
members of the [Knesset](Knesset "wikilink"), Israel's parliament, while
the Knesset is in session.[6]

An exhibit on Biblical sandals and Israeli culture was opened at the
[Eretz Israel Museum](Eretz_Israel_Museum "wikilink") in July 2018.[7]
