**blucher** ( or , , **Bl端cher**) is a style of [shoe](shoe "wikilink")
with open lacing, its [vamp](Vamp_(shoe) "wikilink") made of a single
piece of leather ("one cut"), with [shoelace](shoelace "wikilink")
eyelets tabs sewn on top.[1]

The blucher is similar to a [derby](Derby_shoe "wikilink"): both feature
open lacing, in contrast to the [Oxford shoe](Oxford_shoe "wikilink"),
which uses close lacing, but in the derby the upper has large quarters
with eyelets sewn on top, while in the blucher the upper is made of one
cut, with only the small eyelet tabs sewn on top. In [American
English](American_English "wikilink") these terms are sometimes
confused, with "blucher" also being used to refer to derby shoes, and
"Oxford" also being used to refer to bluchers.

The blucher is named after the 18th century Prussian field marshal
[Gebhard Leberecht von
Bl端cher](Gebhard_Leberecht_von_Bl端cher "wikilink"). General von Bl端cher
commissioned a boot with side pieces lapped over the front in an effort
to provide his troops with improved footwear. This design was adopted by
armies across Europe.[2]
