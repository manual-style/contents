![](Girl_wearing_Sperrys.jpg "fig:Girl_wearing_Sperrys.jpg") **Boat
shoes** (also known as **deck shoes**) are typically canvas or leather
with non-marking rubber soles designed for use on a boat. A
[siping](Siping_(rubber) "wikilink") pattern is cut into the soles to
provide grip on a wet deck; the leather construction, along with the
application of oil, is designed to repel water; and the stitching is
highly durable. Boat shoes are traditionally worn without
[socks](socks "wikilink").[1]

## History

Modern boat shoes were invented in 1935 by American [Paul A.
Sperry](Paul_A._Sperry "wikilink") of [New Haven,
Connecticut](New_Haven,_Connecticut "wikilink") after noticing his dog's
ability to run easily over ice without slipping. Using a knife, he cut
siping into his shoes' soles, inspiring a shoe perfect for boating and a
company called Sperry Top-Sider. [Sperry
Top-Siders](Sperry_Top-Siders "wikilink") are still a popular brand of
boat shoe today, among many others, including Portside,
[Sebago](Sebago_(company) "wikilink") and
[Timberland](The_Timberland_Company "wikilink").[2] Boat shoes are worn
by both women and men.[3]

Boat shoes are used by sailors, as the name suggests; however, since the
1970s they have become casual footwear in coastal areas of the
[Netherlands](Netherlands "wikilink"), [United
States](United_States "wikilink"), [Canada](Canada "wikilink"),
[Argentina](Argentina "wikilink"), [Australia](Australia "wikilink"),
[China](China "wikilink"), [France](France "wikilink"),
[Italy](Italy "wikilink"), [Portugal](Portugal "wikilink"),
[Spain](Spain "wikilink"), and the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink"). Some boat shoes today have
traditional white, non-marking soles, though many others today have dark
non-marking soles. They usually have a *moc-toe* (like a
[moccasin](moccasin "wikilink")) construction. They are usually seen as
somewhat of a status symbol (owning boating shoes usually denotes the
owner of a boat with a deck large enough to walk around on - a
moderately expensive vessel)

In the 1980s through to the early 1990s, they became a fashion trend and
returned in 2007-2008 and continuing in the 2010s,as a fashion trend and
were worn with every day and dressy wear alike by both boys and girls
and men and women. Taking off big time with the upper elementary through
middle school, high school, and college crowds. Besides being worn by
themselves, many children and adults wear them with socks, especially
low-cut, ankle socks and crew in white and many other bright neon and
pastel colors. Many schools with uniform requirements allow boat shoes
as acceptable uniform shoes.

In the 1980s through the early 1990s they were worn with the [slouch
socks](slouch_socks "wikilink") trend. They were worn a lot with tight
rolled/French rolled jeans to show off the [slouch
socks](slouch_socks "wikilink"). Girls would also wear them with a crew
neck or v neck sweater over a turtleneck or a crew neck top with the v
neck sweater and [leggings](leggings "wikilink") with [slouch
socks](slouch_socks "wikilink") over them and Sebagos with many wearing
their hair with a hair band or hair wrap or ponytail and
[scrunchie](scrunchie "wikilink") and bangs for a comfortable and
fashionable look that could be worn casually every day to school,
college, church, hanging out, etc. or would look just as in as a dressy
casual or dressy informal wear. Sebago, Sperry Top-Siders and Eastland
were the three most popular brands at the time and have remained so
through the 2008 into the 2010's fashion trend revival.
