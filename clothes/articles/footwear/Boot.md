[Athens](Athens "wikilink")\]\] A **boot**, plural **boots**, is a type
of specific [footwear](footwear "wikilink"). Most boots mainly cover the
[foot](foot "wikilink") and the [ankle](ankle "wikilink"), while some
also cover some part of the lower calf. Some boots extend up the
[leg](human_leg "wikilink"), sometimes as far as the
[knee](knee "wikilink") or even the [hip](hip "wikilink"). Most boots
have a [heel](heel_(shoe) "wikilink") that is clearly distinguishable
from the rest of the [sole](sole_(shoe) "wikilink"), even if the two are
made of one piece. Traditionally made of [leather](leather "wikilink")
or [rubber](Natural_rubber "wikilink"), modern boots are made from a
variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality –
protecting the foot and leg from [water](water "wikilink"), extreme
cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from
chemicals or use a [steel toe](Steel-toe_boot "wikilink")) or providing
additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction
requirements (e.g., hiking), or may have [hobnails](hobnail "wikilink")
on their undersides to protect against wear and to get better grip; and
for reasons of style and [fashion](fashion "wikilink").

In some cases, the wearing of boots may be required by laws or
regulations, such as the regulations in some jurisdictions requiring
workers on construction sites to wear steel-toed safety boots. Some
[uniforms](uniform "wikilink") include boots as the regulated footwear.
Boots are recommended as well for motorcycle riders.
[High-top](High-top "wikilink") [athletic
shoes](athletic_shoe "wikilink") are generally not considered boots,
even though they do cover the ankle, primarily due to the absence of a
distinct heel. In Britain, the term may be used to refer to football
(soccer) [cleats](cleat_(shoe) "wikilink").

## History

![](Oxhide_boots._Loulan,_Xinjiang._Early_Han_220_BCE_-_8_CE.jpg "fig:Oxhide_boots._Loulan,_Xinjiang._Early_Han_220_BCE_-_8_CE.jpg"),
Xinjiang, China. [Former Han](Former_Han "wikilink") dynasty 220 BC – AD
8.\]\] Early boots consisted of separate
[leggings](leggings "wikilink"), soles, and uppers worn together to
provide greater ankle protection than shoes or
[sandals](sandal "wikilink"). Around 1000 BC, these components were more
permanently joined to form a single unit that covered the feet and lower
leg, often up to the knee. A type of soft leather ankle boots were worn
by [nomads](nomads "wikilink") in eastern Asia and carried to China to
India and Russia around AD 1200 to 1500 by [Mongol](Mongol "wikilink")
invaders. The [Inuit](Inuit "wikilink") and [Aleut](Aleut "wikilink")
natives of Alaska developed traditional winter boots of
[caribou](caribou "wikilink") skin or sealskin featuring decorative
touches of seal intestine, dog hair and suchlike. The early [Dutch
Masters](Dutch_Masters "wikilink") were the first to define the boot in
European [iconography](iconography "wikilink"), in spite of the fact
that the Chinese had been using footwear that the average Frenchman or
Portuguese sailor of the day would have recognized as a boot for
centuries at that time. Most historians agree, though, that the first
codified definition of the boot was entered into law by Royal decree
during the Hundred Years' War, when the Duke of Wales wrote, "that
sturdy, stiff shyue off a type ne'er seent heretofore wi' high scuppers
and ye nailes on the souyle." Sporadic wars were fought among city
states during this time as the Protestants rejected that definition, but
history vindicated the Duke eventually, and the Roche family of
Nantucket actually rose to prominence more as a result of their trade in
these boots in the colonies than from their whaling endeavors.
[European](Europe "wikilink") boots were influenced by military styles,
featuring thick soles and turnover tops that were originally designed to
protect horse mounted soldiers. In the 1700s, distinctive, [thigh-high
boots](thigh-high_boots "wikilink") worn by
[Hessian](Hessian_(soldiers) "wikilink") soldiers fighting in the
[American Revolutionary War](American_Revolutionary_War "wikilink")
influenced the development of the iconic heeled [cowboy
boots](cowboy_boots "wikilink") worn by cattlemen in the [American
west](American_west "wikilink").[1]

## Types and uses

Flight Suit Boots\]\] Boots which are designed for walking through snow,
shallow water and mud may be made of a single closely stitched design
(using leather, rubber, canvas, or similar material) to prevent the
entry of water, snow, mud or dirt through gaps between the laces and
tongue found in other types of shoes. Waterproof
[gumboots](gumboot "wikilink") are made in different lengths of uppers.
In extreme cases, thigh-boots called
[waders](waders_(footwear) "wikilink"), worn by
[anglers](Fisherman "wikilink"), extend to the hip. Such boots may also
be insulated for warmth. With the exception of [gum
boots](gum_boots "wikilink"), boots sold in general retail stores may be
considered "water resistant," as they are not usually fully waterproof,
compared to high-end boots for fishers or hikers.

Speciality boots have been made to protect steelworkers' feet and calves
if they accidentally step in puddles of molten metal, to protect workers
from a variety of chemical exposure, to protect workers from
construction site hazards and to protect feet from extreme cold (e.g.,
with insulated or inflatable boots for use in Antarctica). Most work
boots are "laceups" made from leather. Formerly they were usually shod
with [hobnails](hobnail_(footwear) "wikilink") and heel- and toe-plates,
but now can usually be seen with a thick rubber sole, and often with
steel toecaps.[2]

Boots are normally worn with [socks](sock "wikilink") to prevent chafes
and [blisters](blister "wikilink"), to absorb [sweat](sweat "wikilink"),
to improve the foot's grip inside the boot, or to insulate the foot from
the cold. Before socks became widely available,
[footwraps](footwraps "wikilink") were worn instead.

Specialty boots have been designed for many different types of
[sports](sport "wikilink"), particularly
[riding](equestrianism "wikilink"), [skiing](skiing "wikilink"),
[snowboarding](snowboarding "wikilink"),
[ice-skating](Ice_skating "wikilink"), and sporting in wet/damp
conditions.

### Fashion and fetish use

![](Dr_Martens,_black,_old.jpg "fig:Dr_Martens,_black,_old.jpg") and
[punk subcultures](punk_subculture "wikilink").\]\] [Bovver
boots](Bovver_boot "wikilink"), [Doc Martens](Doc_Martens "wikilink")
boots and [army boots](army_boots "wikilink") were adopted by
[skinheads](skinhead "wikilink") and [punks](punk_fashion "wikilink") as
part of their typical dress and have migrated to more mainstream
fashion, including women's wear.[3] As a more rugged alternative to
[dress shoes](dress_shoe "wikilink"), [dress
boots](dress_boots "wikilink") may be worn (though these can be more
formal than shoes). [Fashionable](Fashion "wikilink") boots for women
may exhibit all the variations seen in other [fashion
footwear](fashion_footwear "wikilink"): tapered or spike
[heels](Heel_(shoe) "wikilink"), platform
[soles](Sole_(shoe) "wikilink"), pointed toes,
[zipper](zipper "wikilink") closures and the like. The popularity of
boots as fashion footwear ebbs and flows. Singer [Nancy
Sinatra](Nancy_Sinatra "wikilink") popularized the fad of women wearing
boots in the late 1960s with her song "[These boots are made for
walking](These_boots_are_made_for_walking "wikilink")". They were
popular in the 1960s and 1970s (particularly knee-high boots), but
diminished in popularity towards the end of the 20th century. In the
2010s, they are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, especially
designs with a long bootleg. Boot bolos, boot bracelets, boot straps,
boot chains, and boot harnesses are used to decorate boots. Sandal boots
also exist.

![](Aa_hobnailedboots_01.jpg "fig:Aa_hobnailedboots_01.jpg") Boots have
become the object of [sexual attraction](sexual_attraction "wikilink")
for some people and they have become a standard accessory in the
[BDSM](BDSM "wikilink") scene (where leather, latex and PVC boots are
favoured) and a fashion accessory in music videos.[4][5] Knee- or
thigh-high leather boots are worn by some strippers and
[pornography](pornography "wikilink") models and actresses. Boots have
even become a [sexual fetish](sexual_fetish "wikilink") for devotees
known as [boot fetishists](boot_fetishism "wikilink") and [foot
fetishists](foot_fetishism "wikilink").

## As symbols

### In heraldry

![](Blason_Aresches.svg "fig:Blason_Aresches.svg") municipality in
France displays a boot in the [heraldic
left](dexter_and_sinister "wikilink") field.\]\] As boots have been used
by riders for millennia, they were used by knights. As a consequence,
albeit not common, boots came to be used as
[charges](charge_(heraldry) "wikilink") in
[heraldry](heraldry "wikilink").

Because of the origin of heraldry as insignia used by mounted warriors
like the medieval knights, when boots are used in heraldry, they are
often displayed as riding boots, even if the [blazon](blazon "wikilink")
might not specify it as such. They are sometimes adorned with spurs,
which may or may not have another
[tincture](tincture_(heraldry) "wikilink") (colour) than the boot and
the background field.

Boots were also used in coats of arms of
[shoemakers](shoemaker "wikilink")' [guilds](guild "wikilink") and in
shop signs outside their shops.

    self up by one's bootstraps" in the sense of "ability to perform a
    difficult task without external help" developed in the 19th century
    in US English.[7] The term "bootstrapping" was subsequently used in
    a metaphorical sense in a number of fields, notably computing (which
    uses the term "[bootup](bootup "wikilink")" to describe the process
    of starting a computer and in
    [entrepreneurship](entrepreneurship "wikilink"), which uses the term
    "bootstrapping" to describe start-up companies which are launched

[7] "It's been widely suggested that the "bootstrap" metaphor originated
in the legendary tales of Baron von Münchhausen. As Chris Waigl recently
pointed out on the Eggcorn Database (commenting on "boots-trap"), the
original German version has a scene in which Münchhausen gets out of a
swamp by pulling on his own hair. In an American retelling (supposedly),
the Baron uses his bootstraps to pull himself out of a similar
predicament. None of the 19th-century cites I've seen allude to the
Münchhausen story -- instead, they often refer to pulling oneself over a
fence or up a steeple. So if Münchhausen really pulls himself up by his
bootstraps in an American version (which I have yet to verify), then the
writer probably took advantage of preexisting imagery for an absurdly
impossible task." Benjamin Zimmer, American Dialect Society, 11 August
