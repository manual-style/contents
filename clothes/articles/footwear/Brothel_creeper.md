**Brothel creepers** (sometimes shortened to **creepers**) are a style
of shoe which has thick [crepe](Crepe_rubber "wikilink") soles, often in
combination with [suede](suede "wikilink") uppers. This style of
footwear became fashionable in the years following [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink"), seeing resurgences of popularity at
various times ever since.

## History and origins of the name

A version of this style of shoe became popular with World War II
soldiers in North Africa, who adopted [suede](suede "wikilink") boots
with hard-wearing [crepe rubber](crepe_rubber "wikilink").[1] Writing in
*[The Observer](The_Observer "wikilink")* in 1991, John Ayto put the
origin of the name 'brothel creeper' to the wartime years.[2] [The
Smithsonian](The_Smithsonian "wikilink") suggests the crepe in the thick
sole may have given the shoes the title creeper. It may also be
associated with a [Ken Mackintosh](Ken_Mackintosh "wikilink") dance tune
popular in 1953 and called "The Creep".[3]

This style of thick soled shoe was first developed commercially in 1949
by George Cox Limited of [Wellingborough](Wellingborough "wikilink"),
[Northamptonshire](Northamptonshire "wikilink"), UK, and marketed under
the "Hamilton" name, based on George Cox Jr.'s middle name.[4] Initially
they came in shades of blue, ranging from pastel shades to electric
blue, and were made of suede or polished leather. Later, more
extravagant patterned versions were created.[5]

### Teddy Boys

The shoes were taken up by the [Teddy Boys](Teddy_Boy "wikilink")– along
with [drainpipe trousers](drainpipe_trousers "wikilink") worn with
exposed socks and [drape jackets](Frock_coat#Teddy_Boys "wikilink").[6]
The shoes were also widely worn by the Ton-Up boys of the 1950s and
later on the [rockers](rocker_(subculture) "wikilink") of the '60s, who
wore them as an alternative shoe when not riding their motorbikes.

манной каше* (home-made brothel creepers) while shooting the 2008
musical *[Stilyagi](Stilyagi_(film) "wikilink") (Russian:*стиляги*)\]\]*

The [stilyagi](stilyagi "wikilink") (Russian: *стиляги*) youth
subculture in the [Soviet Union](Soviet_Union "wikilink") of the mid
1950s adopted home-made brothel creepers as footwear, dubbing them
"shoes on semolina" (*ботинки на манной каше*) alluding to the
sponginess of the thick crepe sole.

### Punk and later revivals

The brothel creeper regained popularity in the early 1970s when [Malcolm
McLaren](Malcolm_McLaren "wikilink") sold them from his "Let it Rock"
shop in [London](London "wikilink")'s [King's
Road](King's_Road "wikilink"), then later in the early 1980s when NaNa's
of Los Angeles manufactured and sold them from their shop in Santa
Monica. Teddy Boys were the obvious customers, but the brothel creeper
still proved to be popular among regular customers[7] when McLaren and
his partner [Vivienne Westwood](Vivienne_Westwood "wikilink") changed
the shop to more [rocker](rocker_(subculture) "wikilink")-oriented
fashion.

The shoe has since been adopted by [subcultures](subculture "wikilink")
such as [indie](Independent_music "wikilink"), [ska](ska "wikilink"),
[punk](Punk_fashion "wikilink"), [new
wavers](New_wave_music "wikilink"),
[psychobilly](psychobilly "wikilink"),
[greasers](Greaser_(subculture) "wikilink") and
[goth](Gothic_fashion "wikilink"), Japanese [Visual
Kei](Visual_Kei "wikilink"), and was worn by
[Bananarama](Bananarama "wikilink"), and
[Saffron](Saffron_(singer) "wikilink"), singer of
[Republica](Republica "wikilink").[8]

A resurgence in popularity of grunge culture in 2011 saw popular artists
such as [Miley Cyrus](Miley_Cyrus "wikilink") and [Carly Rae
Jepsen](Carly_Rae_Jepsen "wikilink") wearing them.[9][10]

In November 2017, [Jefferson Hack](Jefferson_Hack "wikilink") teamed up
with British brand Underground[11] to launch a limited edition
collection of Apollo brothel creepers taken from its archives spanning
the last thirty years. The collection comprised seven classic all gender
styles.[12]

### Puma by Rihanna Creepers

In 2015, [Puma](Puma_(brand) "wikilink") and
[Rihanna](Rihanna "wikilink") launched a collaborative shoe line called
the Puma Creeper. The shoes have been a major success for the brand, and
won an award for Shoe of the Year in 2016.[13] Since the initial launch,
there have been new styles and colorways of the shoe released each year.
