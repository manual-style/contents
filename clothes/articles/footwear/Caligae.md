## Name and history

![](Caliga_Qasr_Ibrim.jpg "fig:Caliga_Qasr_Ibrim.jpg"),
[Egypt](Egypt "wikilink"), 1st century BC – 1st century AD\]\] Caligae
(singular *caliga*) were heavy-duty, thick-soled
[openwork](openwork "wikilink") boots, with
[hobnailed](hobnail "wikilink") soles. Caliga comes from the Latin
*callus* meaning hard, as hobnails were hammered into hard leather soles
before being sewn onto a softer leather lattice. They were worn by the
lower ranks of Roman cavalrymen and foot-soldiers, and possibly by some
centurions.[1] A durable association of caligae with the common soldiery
is evident in the latter's description as *caligati* ("booted ones").[2]
In the early first century AD, the soldiery affectionately nicknamed the
two or three-year-old [Gaius](Caligula "wikilink") "Caligula" ("little
boot"), because he wore a diminutive soldier's outfit, complete with
small *caligae*.[3][4] Occasionally, hobnailed *caligae* must have
proved inconvenient, especially on hard surfaces;
[Josephus](Josephus "wikilink") describes the killing of a *caliga*-shod
Roman centurion who had slipped on the Temple of Jerusalem's marble
floor during an attack.[5] Nevertheless, the design of the *caliga*
allowed for its adjustment, which would have helped reduce chafing; it
probably made an "ideal marching boot",[6] and "the thunderous sound of
an attack by a hobnailed army (*caligati*) must have been
terrifying."[7]

*Caligae* would have been cooler on the march than enclosed boots. In
warm, Mediterranean climates, this may have been an advantage. In
northern Britain's cold, wet climate, additional woven socks or raw wool
wadding in winter may have helped insulate the feet; but *caligae*
seemed to have been abandoned there by the end of the second century AD,
in favour of civilian-style "closed boots"
(*[carbatinae](Carbatina_(shoe) "wikilink")*).[8] By the late 4th
century, this seems to have applied throughout the Empire. The emperor
[Diocletian](Diocletian "wikilink")'s [Edict on
Prices](Edict_on_Prices "wikilink") (301) includes set prices for
*caligae* with no hobnails, made for civilian men, women and
children.[9]

### Design and manufacture

The caliga's [midsole](midsole "wikilink") and the
[openwork](openwork "wikilink") upper were cut from a single piece of
high quality cow or ox-hide. An [outsole](outsole "wikilink") was
fastened to the mid-sole, using clinched [hobnails](hobnail "wikilink"),
usually of iron but occasionally bronze. The clinched hobnail ends were
covered by an [insole](insole "wikilink"). Like all Roman footwear, the
*caliga* was flat-soled. It was laced up the center of the foot and onto
the top of the ankle. [Isidore of
Seville](Isidore_of_Seville "wikilink") believed that the name
"*caliga*" derived from the Latin *callus* ("hard leather"), or else
from the fact that the boot was laced or tied on (*ligere*). Strapwork
styles varied from maker to maker and region to region. The placement of
hobnails is less variable; they functioned to give both grip and
foot-support, much like a modern sports shoe. At least one provincial
manufacturer of army *caligae* has been identified by name.[10]
