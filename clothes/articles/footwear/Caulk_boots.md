![](Logger_Boots.jpg "fig:Logger_Boots.jpg")**Caulk boots** or **calk
boots** [1] (also called **cork boots**, **timber boots**, **logger
boots**, **logging boots**, or **corks**)[2] are a form of rugged
footwear that are most often associated with the timber industry but
could be, though rarely are, worn for hiking and in industries such as
manufacturing and construction, owing to their safety features.[3]

Timber boots are typically made of leather or rubber uppers extending
over the ankle, with a thick rubber sole to provide protection, and
bearing steel spikes for traction.
