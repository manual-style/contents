**Cavalier boots** are a style of [boot](boot "wikilink") that were
popular in Europe between approximately 1500-1700 AD. They are soft
knee-high [leather](leather "wikilink") boots typically made of brown
[calfskin](calfskin "wikilink").[1]

## Origins

Thigh high [riding boots](riding_boots "wikilink") were first worn with
[buff coats](buff_coat "wikilink") by gentlemen and soldiers[2] during
the mid-Tudor period. By the reign of [Elizabeth
I](Elizabeth_I "wikilink") these had low heels to facilitate riding and
were made of soft brown leather.

## Jacobean period

By the reign of [James I](James_I "wikilink") boots had replaced shoes
as the most popular footwear among the upper classes who often wore them
indoors, even with spurs.[3] By the 1620s they resembled the boots worn
by the [Three Musketeers](Three_Musketeers "wikilink"), with a flared
bucket-shaped top and high wooden heels similar to those on [cowboy
boots](cowboy_boot "wikilink").

## Military use

Boots of this type are stereotypically associated with the dashing
[Cavalier](Cavalier "wikilink") of the [English Civil
War](English_Civil_War "wikilink") but in reality many
[Roundheads](Roundhead "wikilink"), including the [Earl of
Essex](Earl_of_Essex "wikilink"), dressed identically to the
Royalists.[4] Cavalier boots remained in use among cavalry until the
late 18th century when they were replaced with the [Hessian
boots](Hessian_boot "wikilink") popularised by
[Prussian](Prussia "wikilink") king [Frederick the
Great](Frederick_the_Great "wikilink").

## Maritime use

Cavalier boots are often associated with [pirates](pirate "wikilink")
and [highwaymen](highwaymen "wikilink") like [Dick
Turpin](Dick_Turpin "wikilink") or [Captain
Blood](Captain_Blood_(novel) "wikilink").[5] These tall boots were
prized by helmsmen and naval officers as they provided excellent
protection from rain and spray. Boots of this design, worn with a
[Sou'wester](Sou'wester "wikilink") and [oilskins](oilskins "wikilink"),
remained in use among fishermen well into the 20th century when they
were replaced with rubber [Wellington boots](Wellington_boot "wikilink")
and [waders](Waders_(footwear) "wikilink").

## Revival

Cavalier boots underwent a revival during the [American Civil
War](American_Civil_War "wikilink") when flamboyant cavalry officers
like [George Armstrong Custer](George_Armstrong_Custer "wikilink") and
[Jeb Stuart](Jeb_Stuart "wikilink") purchased thigh-high riding
boots.[6] Following the successful [Pirates of the
Caribbean](Pirates_of_the_Caribbean "wikilink") films boots of this type
have also become popular among young British women.
