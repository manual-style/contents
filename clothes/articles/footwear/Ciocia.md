## Origins and history

The name probably comes from late Latin *soccus*, meaning
[slipper](slipper "wikilink"). It has many other forms in some Italian
dialects like *chioca*, *chiochiera*, *ciòcero* or *sciòscio* in
[Neapolitan language](Neapolitan_language "wikilink"). The terms
*ciociari* and *[Ciociaria](Ciociaria "wikilink")* have a lexical
similarity to the noun *ciocia*, so many historians thought they have
their root word in local footwear's name, so *ciociari* would mean
'people who wear *ciocie*'.[1]

Italian peasants and shepherds used to wear *ciocie* especially in
[Lazio](Lazio "wikilink"), [Molise](Molise "wikilink") ([province of
Isernia](province_of_Isernia "wikilink")) and
[Abruzzo](Abruzzo "wikilink"), and they were represented since the 18th
century in paintings, in poetry and in storiographic works for their
typical shoes and for their coloured clothes. In
[Basilicata](Basilicata "wikilink"), [Campania](Campania "wikilink"),
[Calabria](Calabria "wikilink"), [Gargano](Gargano "wikilink"),
[Etna](Mount_Etna "wikilink"), [Kosovo](Kosovo "wikilink") and [North
Macedonia](North_Macedonia "wikilink") similar footwears are reported as
well.

In the traditional form, *ciocie* were made of large soles in leather
and straps (*strenghe* or *curiole*) with which the leg was tied from
the ankle to the knee. Before donning the *ciocie*, the feet, ankles,
and calves were covered by a large napkin (*pezza*, plural *pezze*),
instead of socks.
