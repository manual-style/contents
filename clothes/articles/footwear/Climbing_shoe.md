A **climbing shoe** is a specialized type of
[footwear](footwear "wikilink") designed for [rock
climbing](climbing "wikilink"). Typical climbing shoes have a close fit,
little if any [padding](padding "wikilink"), and a smooth, sticky rubber
[sole](sole_(shoe) "wikilink") with an extended rubber . Unsuited to
walking and hiking, climbing shoes are typically donned at the base of a
climb.[1]

## Construction

Modern climbing shoes use carefully crafted multi-piece patterns to
conform very closely to the wearer's feet. [Leather](Leather "wikilink")
is the most common upper material, with other materials such as
[fabric](fabric "wikilink") and [synthetic
leather](synthetic_leather "wikilink") also employed.[2] The [climbing
rubber](climbing_rubber "wikilink") used for soles was developed
specifically for rock-climbing.

Climbing shoes manufactured with a downward pointing [toe
box](toe_box "wikilink") increase the ability to stand on small holds
and pockets at the expense of both comfort and the ability to
[smear](Glossary_of_climbing_terms#smearing "wikilink").

[Approach shoes](Approach_shoes "wikilink") are hybrids between
light-weight hiking shoes and climbing shoes offering some of the
qualities of each.

## Shoe fit

Climbing shoes fit very closely to support the foot and allow the
climber to use small footholds effectively. Most climbers forgo
[socks](sock "wikilink") in order to achieve a more precise fit. As a
result of their tightness, most climbing shoes, particularly the more
aggressive or technical styles, are uncomfortable when properly fitted.

## History

Early rock climbers used heavy-soled
[mountaineering](mountaineering "wikilink") boots studded with metal
cleats and [hobnails](hobnail "wikilink"). An advance on this for dry
rock, were boots with [Vibram](Vibram "wikilink") soles, with a pattern
of rubber studs developed by Vitale Bramani in Italy in the 1930s.[3] In
postwar Britain, a new generation of climbers like [Joe
Brown](Joe_Brown_(climber) "wikilink") began to climb harder routes
wearing [plimsolls](Plimsoll_shoe "wikilink") (rubber-soled canvas
sneakers),[4] sometimes with woolen socks over them to improve grip.[5]
[Pierre Allain](Pierre_Allain "wikilink") was an enthusiastic French
rock climber who experimented with hard composite rubber-soled canvas
boots; by the late 1950s his "PA" boots were being used by climbers
worldwide. Fellow French climber [Edmond
Bourdonneau](Edmond_Bourdonneau "wikilink") later introduced "EB" boots
in 1950 after purchasing Pierre's company,[6] which had softer rubber
soles and became very popular in the 1960 and 1970s. In 1982 Boreal, the
Spanish company located in [Villena](Villena "wikilink"), produced the
"Firé" style of shoe with a revolutionary sticky rubber sole.[7]
