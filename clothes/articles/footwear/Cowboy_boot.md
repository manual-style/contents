**Cowboy boots** refer to a specific style of [riding
boot](riding_boot "wikilink"), historically worn by
[cowboys](cowboy "wikilink").[1] They have a [high
heel](High-heeled_footwear#Men_and_heels "wikilink") that is
traditionally made of stacked leather, rounded to pointed toe, high
shaft, and, traditionally, no lacing. Cowboy boots are normally made
from cowhide [leather](leather "wikilink"), which may be decoratively
hand tooled, but are also sometimes made from "exotic" skins like
[alligator](alligator "wikilink"), [snake](snake "wikilink"),
[ostrich](ostrich "wikilink"), [lizard](lizard "wikilink"),
[eel](eel "wikilink"), [elephant](elephant "wikilink"),
[stingray](stingray "wikilink"), [elk](elk "wikilink"),
[buffalo](American_bison "wikilink"), and so on.

There are two basic styles of cowboy boots, western (or classic), and
roper. The classic style is distinguished by a tall boot shaft, going to
at least mid-calf, with an angled "cowboy" heel, usually over one inch
high. A slightly lower, still angled, "walking" heel is also common. The
toe of western boots was originally rounded or squared in shape. The
narrow pointed toe design appeared in the early 1940s.[2]

A newer design, the "roper" style, has a short boot shaft that stops
above the ankle but before the middle of the calf, with a very low and
squared-off "roper" heel, shaped to the sole of the boot, usually less
than one inch high. Roper boots are usually made with rounded toes, but,
correlating with style changes in streetwear, styles with a squared toe
are seen. The roper style is also manufactured in a lace-up design which
often fits better around the ankle and is less likely to slip off, but
lacing also creates safety issues for
[riding](equestrianism "wikilink"). They usually have some sort of
decorative stitching.

## History

![](Lottie_Briscoe_1914.jpg "fig:Lottie_Briscoe_1914.jpg") in 1914
wearing cowboy boots\]\] [Riding boots](Riding_boot "wikilink") had been
a part of [equestrian](equestrianism "wikilink") life for centuries.
Until the [industrial age](industrial_age "wikilink"), boots were
individually handmade in many different styles, depending on culture.
Early cowboy boot designs, along with other cowboy accouterments, were
also heavily influenced by the [vaquero](cowboy "wikilink") tradition
imported from [Spain](Spain "wikilink") to the Americas, dating back to
the early 16th century. Military boots designed for
[cavalry](cavalry "wikilink") riders also had an influence.

Later, the [Industrial Revolution](Industrial_Revolution "wikilink")
allowed some styles of boots to be mass-produced. One mass-produced boot
style, the [Wellington boot](Wellington_boot "wikilink"), (a shorter but
cavalry-oriented boot) was popular with cowboys in the USA until the
1860s.

During the cattle drive era of 1866â€“1884, the cowboy was not apt to ruin
a good pair of dress boots while working, so some owned more decorative
dress boots to wear in town. The basic style elements permeated even
working boots, and made the Wellington obsolete. Fashion magazines from
1850 and 1860 show the cowboy boot with top stitching, cutouts of
geometric or other natural elements and underslung heel.

The American-style boot was taken up by bootmakers in the cattle
ranching areas of [Texas](Texas "wikilink"),
[Oklahoma](Oklahoma "wikilink"), and [Kansas](Kansas "wikilink").[3] Two
of the best known early bootmakers of the era were [Charles
Hyer](Charles_Hyer "wikilink") of [Hyer Brothers
Boots](Hyer_Brothers_Boots "wikilink") in [Olathe,
Kansas](Olathe,_Kansas "wikilink"), and [H. J. "Daddy Joe"
Justin](Herman_Joseph_Justin "wikilink") of [Justin
Boots](Justin_Boots "wikilink") in [Spanish Fort,
Texas](Spanish_Fort,_Texas "wikilink") and later [Nocona,
Texas](Nocona,_Texas "wikilink"). After Justin moved to Fort Worth where
shipping was easier, the Nocona brand of cowboy boots was made by Enid
Justin Stelzer, eldest daughter of H. J. Justin, who stayed in Nocona
with her husband, and the couple continued the family business.[4] After
the couple divorced, the Olsen-Stelzer brand was started by Stelzer.

T.C. McInerney of Abilene, Kansas, also made the American-style cowboy
boot. A picture of this boot is listed in an ad in the Abilene Weekly
Chronicle on December 7, 1871.[5]

## Design

![](Roper_Boot.jpg "fig:Roper_Boot.jpg")

When mounting and, especially, dismounting, the slick, treadless leather
sole of the boot allowed easy insertion and removal of the foot into the
[stirrup](stirrup "wikilink") of the [Western
saddle](Western_Saddle "wikilink"). The original toe was rounded and a
bit narrowed at the toe to make it easier to insert. While an extremely
pointed toe is a modern stylization appearing in the 1940s, it adds no
practical benefit, and can be uncomfortable in a working boot.

While in the saddle, the tall heel minimized the risk of the foot
sliding forward through the stirrup, which could be life-threatening if
it happened and the rider were to be unseated. There was often
considerable risk that a cowboy would fall from a horse: he often had to
ride young, unpredictable horses, and he had to do challenging
[ranch](ranch "wikilink") work in difficult terrain, which often meant
that he could accidentally become unseated by a quick-moving horse. If a
rider fell from a horse but had a boot get caught in the stirrup, there
arose a very great risk that the [horse](horse "wikilink") could panic
and run off, dragging the cowboy, thus causing severe injury and
possible death.

The tall leather shaft of the boot helped to hold the boot in place in
the absence of lacing. The tall shaft, comfortably loose fit, and lack
of lacing all were additional features that helped prevent a cowboy from
being dragged since his body weight could pull his foot out of the boot
if he fell off while the boot remained stuck in the stirrup. While
mounted, the shaft also protected the lower leg and ankle from rubbing
on the stirrup leathers, as well as fending off brush and thorns,
particularly if also worn with [chaps](chaps "wikilink") or chinks.
While dismounted, the shaft helped protect the leg and foot from rocks,
brush, thorns, and [rattlesnakes](rattlesnake "wikilink"). In wet
weather or creek crossings, the high tops helped prevent the boot from
filling with mud and water.

The modern roper style boot with a low heel and shorter shaft emerged
from the traditional design in response to the needs of modern
[rodeo](rodeo "wikilink"), particularly [calf
roping](calf_roping "wikilink"), where the cowboy had to run to tie the
calf as well as to ride. The lower shaft resulted in a less expensive
boot, but also allowed the boot to be more easily removed. A lace-up
design for roper boots became popular as it prevented the boot from
falling off too easily and provided more ankle support when on foot,
though the lacer also has safety issues because it will not fall off if
a rider is hung up in a stirrup, and, lacking a smooth upper, the
lacings themselves may make it easier for the boot to become caught in
the stirrup in the first place.

Decoration varied widely. Early boots were cowhide leather pieced
together with single rows of top stitching, but as custom boots were
made, cowboys asked for decorative stitching, cutouts in the high tops
(early on, often Texas stars), and different materials. The interaction
of wild west shows and, later, western movies influenced styles that
working cowboys at times adopted. Modern cowboy boots are available in
all colors and can be made from just about every animal whose skin can
be made into leather, including exotic materials such as alligator and
ostrich.

Women's boots have become a major part of the more recent history of the
cowboy boot.

Toe styles have varied through the years, but the basics remain the
same. Popular toe styles include snip, wide snip, square, and round.

One accessory used with cowboy boots are [spurs](spur "wikilink"), which
are sometimes attached to the heel of each boot for the purpose of
cueing a horse while riding.

## Fitting

![](Women's_cowboy_boots.JPG "Women's_cowboy_boots.JPG")

Many cowboy boot companies have been in operation since the 19th
century. Each manufacturer has developed its own
[proprietary](Property "wikilink") [lasts](last "wikilink") for
producing boots, which are considered [trade
secrets](trade_secret "wikilink") and are highly guarded. Because of
this, fitting between companies is not always consistent. Each brand
will fit a little differently from their competition. When considering
wearing a cowboy boot from a different manufacturer, it is recommended
to seek assistance from a knowledgeable merchant who specializes in
cowboy boots if a person cannot try them on in person. Some wearers will
swear by one manufacturer's fit, while others will not perceive any
difference between brands.

For some individuals, the fit may vary depending on the type of toe that
is sought. In a properly fitting boot, regardless of the shape of the
toes, the wearer should be able to wiggle their toes, feeling no
pressure from the sides, top, or front of the boot. If the individual's
foot has a longer than normal arch, or if their foot is more V shaped,
then a narrow toe may present a problem. A rounder toe, or a squared off
toe, will fit more like a regular shoe. Another factor is the choice of
leather. A boot made of a softer leather, such as calfskin, buffalo, or
horsehide, will quickly stretch where appropriate and mold to the
wearer's foot. That is why it is recommended to select a snug size
because the boot will eventually "break in" and a loose fitting boot at
the time of purchase will become sloppy.

However, some individuals also are unaccustomed to the slight slippage
of the heel in a new, non-laced cowboy boot, particularly with a cowboy
heel, and buy a too-small boot in an attempt to stop this slippage. But
a small amount of slippage is also normal at first. This slippage is
caused by the stiffness of a new boot's sole. As the sole becomes more
flexible, the slippage will decrease.

Boot hooks are often required to put on a new pair of boots until they
soften in the arch and break in. A [boot jack](boot_jack "wikilink") is
recommended for removal, though care must be taken not to damage the
heel of the boot when using a jack.
