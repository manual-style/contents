**DC Shoes** is an American company that specializes in footwear for
action sports, including [skateboarding](skateboarding "wikilink") and
[snowboarding](snowboarding "wikilink"). The company also manufactures
apparel, bags, accessories, hats, shirts, and posters.[1]

## History

The company was founded in June 1994 by [Damon
Way](Damon_Way "wikilink") and [Ken Block](Ken_Block "wikilink").[2] It
was originally based in [Carlsbad,
California](Carlsbad,_California "wikilink"), but is now based in
[Huntington Beach, California](Huntington_Beach,_California "wikilink"),
United States.[3] DC originally stood for "Droors Clothing", but since
the sale of Droors Clothing (which is now defunct), DC no longer has
ties to Droors and is simply DC Shoes, Inc.[4]

On March 8, 2004, DC Shoes was acquired by
[Quiksilver](Quiksilver "wikilink") in an
[US$](United_States_dollar "wikilink")87 million transaction.[5][6] In
2010, DC Shoes moved from [Vista,
California](Vista,_California "wikilink"), to Quiksilver's headquarters
in [Huntington Beach](Huntington_Beach "wikilink").[7] A video entitled
*Skateboarding Is Forever* was released online in 2010 and featured
parts from the amateur DC skateboard team at the time: Marquise Henry,
Matt Miller, Wes Kremer, Evan Smith, and Greg Myers. Apart from Myers
and Henry, all of the skateboarders from the video remained sponsored by
the company back in 2013, and have since attained professional status
(Myers was arrested following a [carjacking](carjacking "wikilink")
incident in October 2012[8]).[9][10]

In 2011, the brand underwent a rejuvenation process that included the
design of a new flag logo.[11] As part of this process, new skateboard
team announcements were progressively made and a series of
advertisements, under the direction of new team member [Steve
Berra](Steve_Berra "wikilink"), were released online.[12] The other new
team announcements were Mikey Taylor, [Mike Mo
Capaldi](Mike_Mo_Capaldi "wikilink"), [Nyjah
Huston](Nyjah_Huston "wikilink"), [Chris
Cole](Chris_Cole_(skateboarder) "wikilink"), and Davis
Torgerson.[13][14] Felipe Gustavo was introduced at a later
stage.[15][16]

A further progression of the brand relaunch was the "Rediscover"
campaign that commenced in December 2011, following the addition of
Capaldi and Huston to the skateboard team. The campaign is entitled
"Rediscover DC" and the launch signified the first time that the entire
DC team had been brought together in nearly a decade.[17][18][19]

The first individual installment of the campaign was entitled
"Rediscover Technology" and featured Chris Cole's signature shoe.[20]
The subsequent instalments are as follows:

-   Rediscover the Road: Mike Mo (March 2012)[21]
-   Rediscover Oz: Team (March 2012)[22]
-   Rediscover Dreams: Danny Way (April 2012)[23]
-   Rediscover Opportunity: Matt Miller (May 2012)[24]
-   Rediscover Heritage: Josh Kalis (June 2012)[25]
-   Rediscover Mikey Taylor: Mikey Taylor (July 2012)[26]
-   Rediscover Home: Felipe Gustavo (September 2012)[27]
-   Rediscover Youth: DC Youth Division (October 2012)[28]

Following the brand relaunch, Taylor was the first new team member to
release a signature model, as well as a corresponding full video
part,[29] both of which were launched in July 2012.[30] As of August
2012, the DC company had entered the women's market and the "Women's
Fall 12 Collection" consisted of footwear, apparel, accessories, soft
goods, and accessories.[31]

In the first half of 2013, the promotion of new team members continued
as Capaldi ("Mike Mo S"),[32][33] Kremer ("Wes Kremer Pro"),[34][35] and
Huston released signature shoe models. On the final night of May 2013, a
launch event was held at the Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, California,
U.S. for the first signature model skate shoe of Huston's career, with
[Pete Rock](Pete_Rock "wikilink") in the role of DJ. The model is named
the "Nyjah Huston Signature Shoe" and the promotional advertisement
features Huston executing a trick at set of stairs at Hollywood High
School in Los Angeles, U.S.[36]

Cyril Jackson, accompanied by the "Baker Council S" shoe model, was
introduced as a new amateur team member in mid-August 2013.[37]

Miller's first professional shoe model with the brand was announced on
October 6, 2014. Titled the "Matt Miller S," the shoe was released after
Miller had been sponsored by DC Shoes for six years.[38] The company's
skate team embarked on the "Defy Convention Asia" tour at the start of
November 2014.[39]

Tristan Funkhouser and Bobby De Keyzer were added to the global
skateboarding team amateur squad on December 19, 2014, through the
release of a YouTube welcome video that is just under 10 minutes in
duration. The company described both additions as "unique" in the
promotional blurb for the "Defunkt" video.[40]

### Regional teams

Similar to other larger brands, such as [Nike,
Inc.](Nike,_Inc. "wikilink")[49][50] and
[Adidas](Adidas "wikilink"),[51][52][53] DC sponsors regional teams in
addition to its global team. Initially, national teams, such as the DC
Shoes China team,[54] DC Shoes Spain team,[55][56] DC Shoes Norway,[57]
and DC Shoes Australia were formed,[58][59][60] but in 2013 the various
skate teams seem to have been merged and united under regional titles.
However, as of July 2013,[61] DC Shoes Canada has not been officially
disbanded and the team consists of [Morgan
Smith](Morgan_Smith_(skateboarder) "wikilink"), Josh Clark, Sascha
Daley, Micky Papa, Paul Trep, Will Marshall, Mitch Barrette, Bobby
Dekyzer, and Chad Dickson.[62] Additionally, as of September 2013, a UK
"National" team exists, and consists of Conhuir Lynn, Dave Snaddon, Sean
Smith, Dylan Hughes, and Nicky Howells.[63]

As of September 2013, the DC Shoes Europe team consists of Madars Apse,
Josef Skott Jatta, Thaynan Costa, Michael Sommer, Javier Paredes, Bruno
Aballay, Antony Lopez, Ruben Garcia, and Manuel Margreiter.[64][65] In
late 2012, an Asia Pacific (DC APAC) team superseded the Australian team
and will presumably incorporate skateboarders from the Chinese team,
such as Taiwan pro Adee Lu, as well as other parts of the
[Asia-Pacific](Asia-Pacific "wikilink") region. Tommy Fynn was
introduced as the first member of DC's APAC skate team,[66] followed by
fellow Australian Jake Hayes, whose welcome video part was published on
the [Internet](Internet "wikilink") in April 2013.[67]

As of November 1, 2014, the regional teams were no longer listed on the
company's websites.
