**DVS Shoes** is an American [footwear](footwear "wikilink") and
[clothing](clothing "wikilink") company that specialises in products for
[skateboarding](skateboarding "wikilink"), moto, and
[snowboarding](snowboarding "wikilink"). In a 2018 interview on The Nine
Club, Tim Gavin explained the name DVS "...didn't mean anything." and is
not a shortened version of the word "devious". As of December 2013, the
company is based in [Westminster](Westminster,_California "wikilink"),
in the [Orange County](Orange_County,_California "wikilink") area of
[California](California "wikilink"), US,[1] and is a subsidiary of the
Sequential Brands Group.[2] The company defines itself as "... driven
from the pursuit of building product that embodies the sports the
company athletes breathe every day. With roots deeply embedded in skate,
the company has the platform to develop truly technological products
that bring the riders personalities to life."[3]

## History

DVS was founded in 1995[4] by Tim Gavin and brothers Brian and Kevin
Dunlap—the distribution company Podium Distribution was formed and the
[Lakai Limited Footwear](Lakai_Limited_Footwear "wikilink") brand was a
latter addition to Podium's group of brands (the Matix clothing brand
was Podium's third brand).[5] Almost immediately, the company signed
Korean-American skateboarder [Daewon Song](Daewon_Song "wikilink") who
represented the brand until 2016 when he signed with Adidas
Skateboarding.[6] Following a Chapter 11 filing in 2012, Podium
Distribution ceased to exist as a company.[7] DVS co-founder Gavin
explained the origins of the company in an interview that was published
on June 14, 2013:

### Chapter 11 filing

In May 2012, DVS Shoes filed [bankruptcy](bankruptcy "wikilink"), citing
increased costs in [China](China "wikilink") (where the brand's products
are manufactured) and the general downturn in
[retail](retail "wikilink") sales as a result of the [financial crisis
of 2007–2008](financial_crisis_of_2007–2008 "wikilink") as the reasons
for the filing.[8] Shortly afterwards, DVS was acquired by the
Sequential Brands Group and resumed normal operations, signing new
[sponsorship](sponsor_(commercial) "wikilink") agreements with
[motorcross](motorcross "wikilink") rider [Brian
Deegan](Brian_Deegan_(rider) "wikilink") and professional skateboarders
[Torey Pudwill](Torey_Pudwill "wikilink")[9] and Song.[10]

Gavin, who departed the brand following the bankruptcy, explained his
perspective of the Chapter 11 period in January 2014:

> DVS went through a lot in a short period of time. We grew the business
> every year and ran into growing pains financially and ended up getting
> a line of credit with Bank of America. In 2007, the economy went south
> and we had incredible sales erosion due to retailers going out of
> business, distributors becoming financially distressed, etc. It
> impacted us on a global level quickly. With BOA going through its own
> crisis, they ended up calling our note and while we did what we could
> to pacify them, paying down the note, nothing seemed to satisfy them.
> Things happen fast.[11]

After 18 years with DVS, Gavin formed two new companies in late
2013/early 2014: a "footwear company" with former [Nike
Skateboarding](Nike_Skateboarding "wikilink") and [DC
Shoes](DC_Shoes "wikilink") designer Bryon Schroeder called "Filament",
and the skateboard hardware company "Knox Hardware Mfg., Inc."[12][13]

### 2012 onwards

From October 2012, DVS continued to expand its skateboarding team,
signing [amateur](amateur "wikilink") skater Zack Wallin,[14] and
embarked on a tour of [Detroit](Detroit "wikilink"), US.[15] A
photograph captured during the Detroit tour appeared as the cover for
*The Skateboard Mag* in early 2013—the photograph features Song
executing a trick on a non-typical industrial structure.[16]

In the first half of 2013, the company launched an upgraded website that
features an online store.[17] During this period the skateboard team
toured [Brazil](Brazil "wikilink"), South America[18] and
[Dallas](Dallas,_Texas "wikilink"), US[19] while Song released his
thirteenth signature shoe model with the brand.[20]

Jon Nguyen was officially welcomed to the skate team on July 2, 2013 and
a welcome video was published on the company's [Vimeo](Vimeo "wikilink")
channel in late June 2013.[21] Nguyen's introduction also served as the
inaugural promotion of a new technology for the brand called
"Vaporcell", featured in a new "Vapor" skate shoe model.[22][23]

A review by the "Ripped Laces" website, published in September 2013,
ranked the Vaporcell technology highly for its comfort, board feel and
durability, concluding: " It’s a stylish shoe with some great impact
technology & stability." Using 20 hours of skateboarding as a guide for
its review, the foremost concern that arose for Ripped Laces was the
fading of the shoe sole's grip after a two-week period.[24] The [New
Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink") skateboard magazine *Manual* published
a review in October 2013 and also commended the Vaporcell model: "The
Vapor fits well and offers great support, there’s no sloppy side walls
so your feet definitely wont be sliding around inside of these."[25]

In the second half of 2013, the DVS skate team completed tours of
Canada,[26] and New York City, US.[27] In early 2014, the skate team
completed a tour of [Peru](Peru "wikilink"), South America where they
were invited to Hensley's Bar, an alcohol venue that housed a skateboard
ramp and skateboard memorabilia.[28]

The skate shoe department continued to develop further in early 2014,
with a preview by Pudwill of his third signature shoe model on social
media. Pudwill explained that the "Pudwill 3" will be available at the
time of the [Plan B Skateboards](Plan_B_Skateboards "wikilink") debut
video premiere in November 2014. He stated on April 23, 2014: "Putting
in work in the #torey3s for the #planbvideo coming in Nov! You
ready?"[29]

Also in April 2014, DVS released the "Wee Man" signature colorway of the
"Jarvis" model, designed by [Jason "Wee Man"
Acuña](Jason_Acuña "wikilink")—Acuna appeared in the 1990s skate
magazine *Big Brother* and starred in the magazine's video *Shit*; he
then garnered further public attention in the *Jackass* productions.[30]
In its promotion for the shoe, which was accompanied by a video directed
by former *Big Brother* photo editor Rick Kosick, the brand explained:

> Wee Man has been with DVS for over 10 years, and we're honored to
> release his second signature colorway. Inspired by his 1962 Impala,
> the suede Jarvis is full of details that Wee Man personally selected
> for style and functionality.[31]

A collaboration with the [Cliché
Skateboards](Cliché_Skateboards "wikilink") company was launched in July
2014, with a skate shoe/skateboard deck capsule for professional team
rider Flo Mirtain—the "Jarvis" model was redesigned for the capsule. A
video part of Mirtain skateboarding in Europe was also released to
commemorate the collaboration.[32][33] Also in July 2014, the DVS
skateboard team embarked on the "Planes, Trains and Automobiles"
European tour, with Pudwill, Song, Tolentino, Murawski, Nguyen, Wallin,
Mirtain, Shier, Louis Taubert and Adrien Coillard in attendance.[34]
