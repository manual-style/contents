![](A_Plein_Derby.jpg "fig:A_Plein_Derby.jpg") A **derby** ( , ; also
called **gibson**) is a style of boot or [shoe](shoe "wikilink")
characterized by quarters with [shoelace](shoelace "wikilink") eyelets
that are sewn on top of the [vamp](Shoe#Construction "wikilink").[1]
This construction method, also known as "open lacing", contrasts with
that of the [oxford](Oxford_shoe "wikilink").

In [American English](American_English "wikilink") the derby shoe may be
referred to as a [blucher](Blucher_shoe "wikilink"), although
technically the blucher is a different design of shoe where only eyelet
tabs (not larger quarters) are sewn onto a single-piece vamp.

In modern colloquial English, the derby shoe may be referred to as
"bucks," when the upper is made of
[buckskin](Buckskin_(leather) "wikilink").[2]

The derby became a popular sporting and hunting boot in the 1850s. By
the turn of the [20th century](20th_century_fashion "wikilink"), the
derby had become appropriate for wear in town.[3]
