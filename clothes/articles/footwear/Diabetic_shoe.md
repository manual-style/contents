![](Diabetic_shoes.jpg "fig:Diabetic_shoes.jpg")**Diabetic shoes** are
sometimes referred to as **extra depth**, **therapeutic** shoes or Sugar
Shoes. They are specially designed [shoes](shoe "wikilink"), or [shoe
inserts](shoe_insert "wikilink"), intended to reduce the risk of [skin
breakdown](skin_breakdown "wikilink") in
[diabetics](Diabetes_mellitus "wikilink") with pre-existing
[foot](foot "wikilink") disease.

People with [diabetic neuropathy](diabetic_neuropathy "wikilink") in
their feet may have a false sense of security as to how much at risk
their feet actually are.[1] An [ulcer](Skin_ulcer "wikilink") under the
foot can develop in a couple of hours. The primary goal of therapeutic
footwear is to prevent complications, which can include strain, ulcers,
[calluses](callus "wikilink"), or even
[amputations](amputation "wikilink") for patients with diabetes and poor
circulation.[2] Neuropathy can also change the shape of a person's feet,
which limits the range of shoes that can be worn comfortably.[3] In
addition to meeting strict guidelines, diabetic shoes must be prescribed
by a physician and fit by a certified individual, such as an orthotist,
podiatrist, therapeutic shoe fitter, or
[pedorthist](pedorthist "wikilink"). The shoes must also be equipped
with a removable orthosis. Foot orthoses are devices such as shoe
inserts, arch supports, or shoe fillers such as lifts, wedges and heels.
The diabetic shoes and custom-molded inserts work together as a
preventive system to help diabetics avoid foot injuries and improve
mobility.

In the [United States](United_States "wikilink"), diabetic shoes can be
covered by [Medicare](Medicare_(United_States) "wikilink").[4]
