![](Dress_shoes.jpg "fig:Dress_shoes.jpg") A **dress shoe** (U.S.
English) is a [shoe](shoe "wikilink") to be worn at [smart
casual](smart_casual "wikilink") or [more
formal](dress_code_(Western) "wikilink") events. A dress shoe is
typically contrasted to an [athletic shoe](Sneakers "wikilink").

Dress shoes are worn by many as their standard daily shoes, and are
widely used in [dance](dance "wikilink"), for parties, and for special
occasions.

## Men's dress shoes

### Colors

![](Mens_dress_shoes.jpg "fig:Mens_dress_shoes.jpg") Possible colors
include:

-   [Black](Black "wikilink")
-   [Brown](Brown "wikilink")
-   [Burgundy](Burgundy_(color) "wikilink")
-   [Oxblood](Oxblood "wikilink")
-   [Chestnut](Chestnut_(color) "wikilink")
-   [Cordovan](Cordovan_(color) "wikilink")
-   [White](White "wikilink")

Men's dress shoes are most commonly black or brown. Cordovan or oxblood
dress shoes are worn by men sometimes in the United States, while the
other colors are worn by men of many nationalities.

### Materials

Most men's dress shoes are made of leather, usually entirely, including
the outers, lining, and sole, though for more durability at the expense
of elegance, many shoes are made with rubber soles. Non-leather men's
dress shoes are also available.

Shoes are usually made with many pieces of leather, and the seams can be
decorated in various ways; most revolve around some type of brogueing.
[Brogues](Brogue_shoe "wikilink") have rows of decorative punching in
patterns: full brogues, or wingtips (the standard American name), have a
toe cap in a wavy shape, with punched patterns on various sections of
the shoe; half brogues have a normal straight edged toe cap and less
punching; finally, other terms such as *quarter-brogue* etc. may be used
to describe progressively less brogueing. All of the standard styles
below may be brogued.

### Styles

Men's shoes are often categorised by their fastening, and the various
possibilities are listed below in roughly descending order of formality.

#### [Oxfords](Oxford_shoe "wikilink")

Oxfords (British), or Balmorals (American), lace up and tie to keep them
on the wearer's foot, and have a closed lacing, where the pieces of
leather joined by the laces are sewn together at the bottom. Many
Oxfords have an additional piece of leather sewn over the toe section,
known as a toe cap. Oxfords are the standard shoe to wear with most
suits. White Buck shoes are a variant of the oxford that are made of
buckskin, and considered the companion to seersucker and other summer
suit fabrics.

#### [Monk shoes](Monk_shoe "wikilink")

A monk shoe (also called a monkstrap) has no lacing, and is closed by a
strap with a buckle. Monk shoes are typically regarded as less formal;
they are often considered appropriate for business formal, but rarely
appropriate with any kind of formal attire.

#### [Derbies](Derby_shoe "wikilink")

Derbies, or Blüchers in America, are similar to Oxfords, but have open
lacing. They are a little less formal, and are often worn in brown, with
some [brogueing](Brogue_shoe "wikilink").

#### [Loafers](Loafers "wikilink")

Loafers, or slip-ons, come in both men's and women's styles. It is not
unusual for a man's loafer to have a [tassel](tassel "wikilink"),
although this can be seen in women's varieties too. Loafers were
originally men's shoes, and are usually thought of as such, although
women do now wear them.

#### Other styles

In addition to the above, there are various less common types of
footwear to accompany [formalwear](formalwear "wikilink"), such as the
[court shoe](court_shoe "wikilink") (also called opera shoe, or patent
pumps) for eveningwear and the [dress boot](dress_boot "wikilink") for
daywear.

## Women's dress shoes

### Colors

Women's dress shoes come in a variety of colors, which includes:

-   [Black](Black "wikilink")
-   [Silver](Silver_(color) "wikilink")
-   [Gold](Gold_(color) "wikilink")
-   [Tan](Tan_(color) "wikilink")
-   [White](White "wikilink")
-   [Red](Red "wikilink")
-   [Yellow](Yellow "wikilink")

They may also match the color of the [gown](evening_gown "wikilink"),
[dress](dress "wikilink") or suit being worn.

### Styles

#### Pumps

[Pumps](Court_shoe "wikilink") come in a variety of colors and styles.
They can have a rounded or pointed toe, and are usually made of
[leather](leather "wikilink"). They have a heel of at least 5 cm
(2 inches). Today, pumps have evolved beyond the classic working woman's
shoe. Now, there are peep toe pumps, which have a small opening at the
toes. There are also pumps with ankle straps. Not only have the styles
evolved, the fabrics have as well. While almost all pumps used to be
made of leather, pumps now come in a variety of materials, such as
[suede](suede "wikilink") and [wool](wool "wikilink").

#### Slingbacks

The [slingback](slingback "wikilink") is similar to the pump in that it
can have a rounded or pointed toe and usually has a heel, but it doesn't
wrap all the way around the heel like pumps usually do. Instead, it has
a narrow strap that is pulled up over the heel, leaving the rest of the
heel exposed.

#### Loafers

[Loafers](Loafers "wikilink") are usually flat and typically thought of
as both more masculine and comfortable than anything with a heel. The
typical loafer has a round toe, and comes in darker colors, such as
black or brown. A spin on the loafer is the cloak, which, like the
loafer, is a slip-on shoe, but it has a heel and is considered a more
"feminine" design.

#### Mules

[Mules](Mule_(footwear) "wikilink") are shoes that slide onto the foot,
and do not cover the heel or the back of the foot at all. These aren't
considered dress shoes unless they have a heel.

#### Ballet flats

The [ballet flat](ballet_flat "wikilink") hadn't been a popular fashion
trend until some time after the first few years of the 21st century.
Taken from the art of ballet, as their name implies, they are flat shoes
with a rounded toe, and come in many different colors and patterns. The
classic ballet flat has a small bow on the toe, but this style has
evolved to include varieties without bows.

#### Sandals

![](1er_Prix_Créatif_2012.JPG "fig:1er_Prix_Créatif_2012.JPG") While
sandals are usually more casual, there are some sandals that can be worn
with dress clothes. For example, any sandal that has a heel, many
straps, or a shiny finish would probably be acceptable in a more formal
atmosphere. A minor controversy erupted in 2005 when some members of
[Northwestern University](Northwestern_University "wikilink")'s national
champion [women's lacrosse
team](Northwestern_Wildcats_women's_lacrosse "wikilink") visited the
[White House](White_House "wikilink") wearing flip-flops. Following the
criticism, their footwear was eventually auctioned off on
[eBay](eBay "wikilink") to raise money for a young
[cancer](cancer "wikilink") patient, Jaclyn Murphy of [Hopewell
Junction, New York](Hopewell_Junction,_New_York "wikilink"), who was
befriended by the team. Nine pairs of flip-flops raised approximately
$1,653.[1] There is still a debate over whether this signaled a
fundamental change in American culture — many youth feel that flip-flops
are more dressy and can be worn in a variety of social contexts, while
older generations feel that wearing them at formal occasions signifies
laziness and comfort over style.[2] The [Dalai
Lama](Dalai_Lama "wikilink") of [Tibet](Tibet "wikilink") is also a
frequent wearer of flip-flop sandals and has met with several US
presidents, including [George W. Bush](George_W._Bush "wikilink") and
Barack Obama, while wearing the sandals.[3][4]
