The *Earth Shoe* (also known as the *Kalsø Earth Shoe*) was an
unconventional style of [shoe](shoe "wikilink") invented in the 1970s by
Danish yoga instructor and shoe designer Anna Kalsø.[1] Its unique
Negative Heel Technology design featured a sole that was thinner at the
heel than at the forefoot, so that when wearing them, one walked
heel-downward at -3.7º, as when walking in sand, with various claimed
health benefits.

The shoes were introduced in the United States in New York City on April
1, 1970, three weeks before the first [Earth Day](Earth_Day "wikilink").

The shoes surged in popularity and were prominently featured on The
Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and in TIME Magazine. When the
manufacturer of Kalsø Earth Shoes was unable to keep up with demand,
franchise owners pursued litigation against the United States
distributor. Retail sales of the brand in the U.S. were discontinued by
the late 1970s.

In 2001, Kalsø Earth Shoes re-surfaced after the rights to the name,
technology and branded properties were purchased by Meynard Designs,
Inc. Subsequent reorganization of Meynard Designs led to the creation of
Earth, Inc., as the manufacturing and marketing entity for Kalsø Earth
Shoes. They are not to be confused with the Earth shoe brand sold by
WalMart et al, as only the Kalsø Earth Shoe features the Negative Heel
Technology.
