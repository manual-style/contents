## History

In 1890, Edward Green began to make hand-crafted shoes for gentlemen in
a small factory in [Northampton](Northampton "wikilink").

The company was sold in 1977 by Green’s nephew, Michael Green to an
American leather entrepreneur, Marley Hodgson, but financial problems
continued and it was sold for a single British pound to another bespoke
shoemaker, John Hlustik, an expert at finishing who is often credited
with making brown shoes acceptable to British gentlemen. Upon Hlustik’s
death in 2000, the company was willed to his partner, Hilary Freeman.
