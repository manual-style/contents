**Engineer boots**, also known as **engineer's boots** or **engineering
boots**, are an American type of traditional leather
work-[boots](boot "wikilink"). Their lace-less, rugged construction made
them popular among [motorcycle](motorcycle "wikilink") riders.
Originally developed in the 1930s for
[firemen](Fireman_(steam_engine) "wikilink") working on [steam
locomotives](steam_locomotive "wikilink"), the boots gained substantial
popularity in the postâ€“[World War II](World_War_II "wikilink") era
during a growing motorcycling culture. They became popular symbols of
teenage rebellion in the 1950s and a common component of
[greaser](Greaser_(subculture) "wikilink") wear. They were later adopted
by [skinheads](skinhead "wikilink") and
[punks](Punk_(subculture) "wikilink") in the 1970s. By the 2010s,
engineer boots were being popularly worn for fashion purposes,
especially by non-traditional customers such as women, [young urban
professionals](Yuppie "wikilink"), and
[hipsters](Hipster_(contemporary_subculture) "wikilink").

## Description

Engineer boots are typically made from thick, stiff, full-grain [bull
hide](cowhide "wikilink"). The leather is often oiled to add durability
and flexibility, and may be brown or black in color.[1] The
double-layered shafts may be anywhere between 7 inches to 17 inches in
height, and are [gusseted](gusset "wikilink") at the top and relatively
loose, though they can be tightened by a steel-buckled strap. Another
steel-buckled strap is placed at the instep of each boot. As per their
rugged construction, the footwear is relatively heavy.[2]

Original engineer boots were almost always black in color. The toes were
bulbous and the soles were made of thick leather. The heels were about
one-and-three-quarter inches in height with a slight forward slant, with
the edges being concave. Some were customized with studded straps or
with [cleats](Cleat_(shoe) "wikilink"). Modern engineer boots vary in
toe shape, heel height, sole material, or in the use of [steel
reinforcements](steel_toe "wikilink").[3]

## History

### Origins

Around 1860, [the Frye Company](the_Frye_Company "wikilink") produced a
popular line of [harness boots](harness_boot "wikilink"). Quickly
adopted by the [United States
Cavalry](United_States_Cavalry "wikilink"), they featured an ankle strap
that attached to metal rings, a style which may have served as
inspiration for the design of the engineer boot. During the 1930s, the
[Chippewa Shoe Manufacturing Company](Chippewa_Boots "wikilink")
developed a pair of boots with stovepipe shafts based on the style of
English horse-[riding boots](riding_boot "wikilink"). The [West Coast
Shoe Company](West_Coast_Shoe_Company "wikilink") (Wesco) began
manufacturing their "engineer boots" in 1939.[4] Engineer boots were
originally meant as protective gear for
[firemen](Fireman_(steam_engine) "wikilink") working on [steam railway
engines](steam_locomotive "wikilink") (i.e. "engineers"), as their
minimal stitching and pull-on design made them ideal for working in
conditions with hot coals, embers, and sharp edges.[5][6] This is a
probable source of the name. Wesco's boots were immediately popular with
welders in [Portland, Oregon](Portland,_Oregon "wikilink")-area
shipyards, who needed looser fitting shoes that could be quickly removed
if [embers](ember "wikilink") landed in the shafts.[7] Engineer boots
were overtaken in the shoe market during [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink") by the production of lace-up [combat
boots](combat_boots "wikilink")[8] and demand dramatically decreased.[9]

### Widespread use

![](James_Dean_grabbing_Jim_Backus.jpg "fig:James_Dean_grabbing_Jim_Backus.jpg")
Both Chippewa and Wesco heavily increased sales of engineer boots in the
late 1940s. There was a post-war production boom for the boots, with
high demand coming from returning veterans and
[bikers](Motorcycle "wikilink").[10] The latter adopted engineer boots
because the laceless design would not interfere with motorcycle drive
belts, the shafts were well insulated from heat, and they provided full
lower leg protection in case of an accident.[11] The footwear's
popularity was furthered by its use by celebrities such as [Marlon
Brando](Marlon_Brando "wikilink") and [James
Dean](James_Dean "wikilink") in their respective films *[The Wild
One](The_Wild_One "wikilink")* (1953) and *[Rebel Without a
Cause](Rebel_Without_a_Cause "wikilink")* (1955).

The boots would become heavily associated with the American
[greasers](Greaser_(subculture) "wikilink") and bikers who wore them in
the 1950s. Overall, they contributed to the "rebellious" look of many
teenagers of the era. This aesthetic was utilised in the 1961 [crime
drama](crime_drama "wikilink") *[The Young
Savages](The_Young_Savages "wikilink")*, with this footwear being worn
by the antagonists, three young urban gang members. From the 1950s
through the 1970s engineer boots were frequently advertised in retail
[mail order](mail_order "wikilink") catalogs.[12] By the late 1960s,
engineer boots were being frequently worn by
[hustlers](Male_prostitution "wikilink") and members of the gay [leather
subculture](leather_subculture "wikilink") for [fetishistic
purposes](boot_fetishism "wikilink"). In the 1970s, they were adopted by
[skinheads](skinheads "wikilink"). From there, they became a part of
[punk fashion](punk_fashion "wikilink"), where they were used to express
power and an industrial style. By the 2010s, engineer boots, along with
other industrial footwear, were worn popularly for fashion purposes,
especially by non-traditional customers such as women, [young urban
professionals](Yuppie "wikilink"), and
[hipsters](Hipster_(contemporary_subculture) "wikilink").[13]
