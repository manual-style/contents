A **fashion boot** is a [boot](boot "wikilink") worn for reasons of
style or fashion (rather than for utilitarian purposes – e.g. not hiking
boots, riding boots, rain boots, etc.). The term is usually applied to
women's boots. Fashion boots come in a wide variety of styles, from
ankle to thigh-length, and are used for casual, formal, and business
attire. Although boots were a popular style of women's footwear in the
Nineteenth Century, they were not recognized as a high fashion item
until the 1960s. They became widely popular in the 1970s and have
remained a staple of women's winter wardrobes since then.

## History

### Pre-1960s

1922\]\]

In the 19th and early 20th Centuries, ankle and calf-length boots were
common footwear for women. Rising hemlines made longer styles of boots
popular. In 1913, Denise Poiret, the wife of celebrated French couturier
[Paul Poiret](Paul_Poiret "wikilink"), caused a sensation in Paris and
New York by wearing knee-length boots in wrinkled Morocco leather.
Designed by her husband, made by the bottier Favereau, and styled with a
low heel and a square toe, she had versions in red, white, green, and
yellow.[1][2] By 1915 *[The New York
Times](The_New_York_Times "wikilink")* was reporting that, inspired by
Mme Poiret, women had adopted these "[Russian
boots](Russian_boot "wikilink")" as an acceptable alternative to baring
ankles and calves.[3] By the 1920s Russian boots were available in a
variety of styles, calf- or knee-length, with a Cuban or Louis
heel,[4][5] which could be pull-on, or zip-fastened for a closer fit.[6]
Worn with knee-length skirts, they often featured decorative features
such as elaborate stitching or fur trims.[7][8][9]

Russian boots were popular during the 1920s[10] and the emergence of
these tall boots for women was interpreted by some contemporary writers
as a consequence of women's transition from the “leisure class” to the
world of business.[11] But as their popularity grew, concerns over
quality[12][13] meant that where protection from the elements was
needed, Russian boots were increasingly replaced by fashionable variants
of the rubber [Wellington boot](Wellington_boot "wikilink").[14] As
roads were surfaced and horse-drawn transport gave way to the motor
engine, the additional protection provided by boots was no longer
needed. Boots were seen as restrictive and uncomfortable when compared
with the new styles of fashionable shoe that complimented a more
streamlined and simplified look for women's clothing.[15] Although they
were still popular as late as the beginning of the 1930s,[16] within a
few years Russian boots had fallen out of favor.

### 1960s

American designer [Beth
Levine](Beth_Levine_(fashion_designer) "wikilink") is widely credited as
the first person to introduce boots into Haute Couture.[17][18] As early
as 1953, Beth Levine introduced under the [Herbert
Levine](Herbert_Levine_(company) "wikilink") label a calf-length boot in
white kidskin,[19] which sold poorly. Most retailers saw boots as a
separate category of footwear from shoes, to be worn for protection from
bad weather or for work. By contrast, Levine argued that boots *were*
shoes and could be an integral part of a woman's outfit. In 1957,
[Herbert Levine](Herbert_Levine_(company) "wikilink") produced an entire
collection of based around fashion boots,[20] and despite widespread
skepticism on the part of other designers and manufacturers,[21]
calf-high, [kitten-heeled](Kitten_heel "wikilink") fashion boots for
women[22] began to grow in popularity in the late 1950s and early
1960s.[23] In 1962 [Balenciaga](Balenciaga "wikilink")'s fall collection
featured a tall boot by Mancini that just covered the knee;[24][25] the
following year [Yves Saint
Laurent's](Yves_Saint-Laurent_(designer) "wikilink") couture collection
included thigh-length alligator skin boots by designer [Roger
Vivier](Roger_Vivier "wikilink")[26][27][28] and
[*Vogue*](Vogue_(magazine) "wikilink") was able to announce that boots
of all lengths were the look of the moment.[29][30] The re-emergence of
boots as a fashion item in the 1960s has been interpreted as an antidote
to the femininity of [Dior's](Christian_Dior_S.A. "wikilink") post war
"[New Look](Christian_Dior_S.A.#The_.22New_Look.22 "wikilink")".[31]

Rising hemlines and the availability of new, brightly colored artificial
materials such as PVC,[32] combined to make boots an attractive fashion
option for younger women. In 1965 [André
Courrèges](André_Courrèges "wikilink") released the first of his iconic
white leather calf-length boots[33] and designers such as [Mary
Quant](Mary_Quant "wikilink"), who launched her own "Quant Afoot" line
of footwear in 1967,[34] produced inexpensive, machine-molded plastic
boots in a variety of different colors to be worn in tandem with
miniskirts. The rising price of leather during the 1960s made these
plastic and vinyl boots[35][36] a popular alternative to more
traditional footwear.[37] As skirts became even shorter in the late
1960s, there was a resurgence of interest in [thigh-length
boots](thigh-length_boots "wikilink") or cuissardes.[38][39] [Pierre
Cardin](Pierre_Cardin "wikilink") featured shiny black PVC thighboots as
part of his futuristic 1968 couture collection[40] and Beth Levine
designed seamless, stretch vinyl and nylon stocking boots tall enough to
do double duty as hosiery.[41][42][43] The tallest boots from this
period were so high that they were equipped with suspenders to hold them
up.[44][45] High laced boots, similar to those worn in Edwardian times,
were also popular.[46]

### 1970s and 1980s

![](Pan-T-Boots_DSCF2201.jpg "fig:Pan-T-Boots_DSCF2201.jpg")

Although fashion boots and particularly '[go-go
boots](go-go_boots "wikilink")' are often described as 'typical' of
1960s fashion, it wasn't until the 1970s that boots became a mainstream
fashion staple for women;[47] for many women in the 1960s, boots were
seen as "a superfluous accessory" more suitable for teenagers and
college girls than a grown woman[48] while, in 1968, 75% of office
managers surveyed by *[The New York
Times](The_New_York_Times "wikilink")* disapproved of their female staff
wearing boots to work.[49] By contrast, in 1977, boots made up 20
percent of all women's shoe sales in the United States[50] and the end
of the decade saw fashion boots occupying multiple pages of mainstream
mail-order catalogs by companies such as [Sears](Sears "wikilink"),[51]
[Wards](Montgomery_Ward "wikilink"),[52] and
[Kays](Kays_Catalogues "wikilink").[53]

The early 70s were typified by tight-fitting, vinyl boots rising to the
knee or higher.[54][55][56] These sometimes had mock lacing on the front
and zipped up at the rear; they could be worn under the new maxi
dresses, which had slits in them to show the leg.[57] An even higher
combination was the Pan-T-Boot, a single garment combining stretch
tights with boots.[58] In summer, pale, high-legged boots in printed or
open weave fabric were teamed with summery dresses;[59] these often had
extensive cut-outs, so that they were more like high-legged sandals than
conventional boots.[60][61][62]
[Platform-soled](Platform_shoe "wikilink") styles[63] were also popular.
The multi-colored suede and canvas over-the-knee boots produced by the
London store [Biba](Biba "wikilink")[64] were so sought-after that
queues would form outside the store when a delivery was due.[65] By the
late 1970s, form-fitting, shaped-leg boots were being replaced with
straight-legged designs,[66][67] frequently worn over jeans or other
pants, which were often pulled-on rather than zip-fastened.[68] As well
as high-heeled dress boots, more rugged designs, by companies such as
[Frye](The_Frye_Company "wikilink"), were widely worn.[69][70] The end
of the decade saw a growth in popularity of shorter, calf-length
boots,[71] often worn layered with socks and tights,[72] and a revival
of interest in over-the-knee and thigh-length boots,[73][74] which were
popularized by punk and new wave performers such as Blondie's [Debbie
Harry](Debbie_Harry "wikilink").

In contrast to the preceding decade, the 1980s saw a sharp decline in
the popularity of high-legged boots. Instead, ankle boots in a variety
of styles were particularly popular, as were low-heeled, calf-length,
pull-on styles.[75][76] Knee length boots, if worn at all, tended to be
low-heeled, pull-on styles, sometimes referred to as “riding boots,”
that were combined with long skirts. In the late 1980s, over-the-knee
boots made a reappearance; these were loose-fitting, low-heeled styles
in suede,[77] often brightly colored or decorated with brocade.[78] In
1990, [Karl Lagerfeld](Karl_Lagerfeld "wikilink") included thigh-length
satin boots in his Fall/Winter Couture collection for
[Chanel](Chanel "wikilink"), using the boots as an alternative to
leggings,[79] but it was not until the following decade that the
inherent elegance of classic dress boot styles was
rediscovered.[80]![](Rachel_Ray_boots_2009.jpg "fig:Rachel_Ray_boots_2009.jpg"),

### 1990–1999

The early 1990s saw an explosion in dance club culture and its
associated fashions, many of which looked back to the 1960s for
inspiration, as well as drawing on fetish-themed elements. Knee-length
go-go boots, platform-soled boots, and even thigh-length PVC boots were
worn by clubbers, but although some designers flirted with these styles
of footwear (e.g. [Gianni Versace](Gianni_Versace "wikilink"))
mainstream take-up was limited. Nonetheless, by 1993 boots were popular
enough for *[Vogue](Vogue_(magazine) "wikilink")* to declare that it was
"The Year of the Boot",[81] with a wide range of styles from
ankle-length to over-the-knee, designed to be worn at any time and with
any hem length.[82] Knee-length boots became commonplace again,
initially as lace-up styles[83] which were subsequently replaced by
zip-fastened boots in the second half of the decade. In 1995,
[Versace](Gianni_Versace "wikilink")’s Fall/Winter collection featured
slim-fitting, spike heeled boots, rising to just below the knee,[84]
which were a precursor of the commonest style of dress boot for the next
10 years. Just as boots in the 1960s were seen as an antidote to the
femininity of the ‘New Look’,[85] this early nineties resurgence was
linked to the development of lighter, more feminine clothing styles that
were contrasted and complemented by wearing boots.[86]

### 2000–2018

By the turn of the 21st century (2000–2007 and 2017-2018) and fashion
boots in a variety of styles were back to the same level of ubiquity
that they had enjoyed in the 1970s.[87] A pair of knee-length boots,
often with metal accents, was widely regarded as a must-have wardrobe
item for the clothes-conscious woman,[88][89] paired with knee length
skirts and dresses for business and casual wear.[90][91][92] Ankle boots
also remained very popular and in the latter part of the first decade
knee-length styles worn over pants,[93] especially jeans,[94] were
common. In 2009 thigh-length boots were a subject of major attention by
the fashion press,[95][96][97][98][99][100] receiving guarded approval
and a level of mainstream acceptance that they had never previously
achieved; this trend continued in 2010[101][102][103] and by the
following year over-the-knee styles had become commonplace. Also in
2011, ankle boots were being promoted as a popular summer alternative to
sandals.[104]

## Design

![](Fashion_boot_terminology.png "Fashion_boot_terminology.png")

Fashion boots generally employ the same range of soles and heels as are
found in shoes. The defining character of the boot is the length of the
shaft. Ankle boots generally have a shaft height of less than 8 inches
(20 cm), calf-length boots 8–15 inches (20–38 cm), knee-length boots
15–19 inches (38–48 cm), while over-the knee boots have shaft lengths of
19 inches (38 cm) or more; however these divisions are arbitrary and at
the boundaries the decision as to whether a boot is, for example,
calf-length or knee-length is largely subjective.

The shaft of a fashion boot can be fitted (i.e. following the curve of
the wearer's calf), straight-legged, or loose-fitting (or “slouchy”). In
close-fitting boots, flexibility is achieved by the use of gussets;
slits in the material either at the top of the shaft (in knee-length
boots), or wider panels at the sides of the shaft (in ankle boots),
which are backed with elasticized fabric. Compression folds around the
ankle allow for movement of the foot. In over-the-knee boots, flexion of
the knee is usually attained by a vent at the back of the boot, running
from the top of the shaft to the back of the knee. This may be closed
with laces, elasticized, or left open. Where a vent is not used, freedom
of movement is achieved either by having the top of the shaft flare
outwards above the knee, or making all or part of the shaft out of a
stretchable material.

A variety of fasteners are seen in fashion boots. Laces are commonly
used in ankle boots, but are too time-consuming for longer styles. Zip
fasteners are widely employed in all styles of boot – they may run the
entire length of the shaft, or just the ankle and lower calf – these
partial-length zips make it easier to insert the foot into the toe of
the boot by relaxing the fit around the ankle. Pull-on boots have no
fasteners and tend to have a looser fit than zip or lace-up boots; they
sometimes have a loop of leather at the top of the shaft, called a
boot-strap, to assist with pulling the boot on. Finally, button-fastened
boots were common at the beginning of the last century but are rarely
seen today. If present, buttons are usually employed as design accents
on boots; other decorative features include straps, buckles, studs, and
decorative stitching.

### Ankle boot

These are the most widely worn style of fashion boots, usually under
pants.[105] Ankle boots are also the only type of fashion boot commonly
worn by both men and women, and the only one to have remained popular
without a break since the 19th Century. They vary in length from booties
or shoe boots (effectively a shoe that skims the ankle[106]) to boots
that cover the lower part of the calf.

### Calf-length boot

Because the top of this boot hits the curve of the leg at the widest
point of the calf it is regarded by stylists as particularly challenging
to wear; even average legs can look fat.[107] For this reason,
calf-length boots are usually worn under pants or with long skirts that
cover the top of the boot.[108]

### Knee-length boot

These come in a wide variety of colors and materials (e.g. leather,
suede, fabric) and can be worn with skirts or dresses of any length,
under or over pants, or with leggings. A boot that hits the leg just
below the knee is thought to be particularly stylish.[109]

### Over-the-knee boot

Also known as thighboots or cuissardes, these boots were originally worn
by men in the 16th – 18th Centuries to protect the legs while
riding[110][111] before being adapted as a fashion item for women in the
1960s. In this context they have sometimes been considered provocative
or daring because of past association with fetishism and the sex
industry[112] and so have had patchy mainstream acceptance. Even when
popular, a combination of one or more features such as lower heels,
softer materials (e.g. suede), muted colors, and avoidance of skin
exposure (by wearing over pants, leggings, or opaque
hose)[113][114][115][116][117] is usually employed to avoid the
so-called "Vivian" effect (a reference to [Julia
Roberts](Julia_Roberts "wikilink")' character in the 1990 movie [Pretty
Woman](Pretty_Woman "wikilink")).
