A **flamenco shoe** is a type of [shoe](shoe "wikilink") worn by
[flamenco](flamenco "wikilink") dancers. They are typically worn by
female dancers, they are called flamenco heel, often with [traje de
flamenca](traje_de_flamenca "wikilink") costumes. Male flamenco dancers
traditionally wear short, heeled boots, although there are now some
flamenco shoe styles available for men.

## Construction

Flamenco shoes constructed for dance generally have small nails embedded
in the toe and heel to enhance the sound of the dancer's percussive
footwork. The most common materials are leather and suede, although
synthetic materials are also used in certain grades of shoes. Heel types
can include "standard", "carrete" (curved), or "cubano" (short and
thick) with a heel size generally ranging from 4 cm to 7 cm. Heels are
often covered by the main material but may also be exposed wood.
Fastenings may include elastic or leather straps, buckles, or laces.[1]

Many contemporary flamenco shoe manufacturers sell varying quality
grades of shoes aimed at dancers from amateur to semi-professional and
professional levels. Shoe grades may be named differently by different
manufacturers. Professional-level shoes often have extra reinforcement
and other enhancements for durability and sound quality.

## Production

Historically, flamenco shoes were handcrafted in Spain. Today, there are
still many Spanish workshops specializing in the production of flamenco
shoes.
