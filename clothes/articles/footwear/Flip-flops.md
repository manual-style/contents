Flip-flop}} ![](Flip_flops.png "fig:Flip_flops.png") **Flip-flops** are
a type of [sandal](sandal "wikilink"), typically worn as a form of
casual wear. They consist of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a
Y-shaped strap known as a toe thong that passes between the first and
second toes and around both sides of the foot or can be a hard base with
a strap across all the toes (these can also be called sliders).

This style of footwear has been worn by the people of many cultures
throughout the world, originating as early as the [ancient
Egyptians](ancient_Egypt "wikilink") in 1,500 B.C.

In the [United States](United_States "wikilink") the flip-flop descends
from the Japanese [zōri](zōri "wikilink"), which became popular after
[World War II](World_War_II "wikilink") as soldiers brought them back
from Japan. They became popular unisex summer footwear[1] starting in
the 1960s.

## Etymology

The term *flip-flop* has been used in
[American](American_English "wikilink") and [British
English](British_English "wikilink") since the 1960s to describe the
thong or no-heel-strap [sandal](sandal "wikilink"). It is an
[onomatopoeia](onomatopoeia "wikilink") of the sound made by the sandals
when walking in them.[2] They are called *thongs* (sometimes
*pluggers*[3]) in [Australia](Australia "wikilink"),[4] *jandals*
(originally a trademarked name derived from "Japanese sandals") in [New
Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink"),[5] *slops* or “visplakkies” in [South
Africa](South_Africa "wikilink")[6] and [Zimbabwe](Zimbabwe "wikilink"),
and *tsinelas* or *step-in* in the [Philippines](Philippines "wikilink")
(or, in some Visayan localities, "smagol", from the word *smuggled*).

This footwear has a number of other names around the world. The
[Japanese](Japan "wikilink") wear similarly designed, traditional straw
sandals known as [zōri](zōri "wikilink").[7] Throughout the world, they
are known by a variety of other names, including *dép tông* or *dép xỏ
ngón* in [Vietnam](Vietnam "wikilink"), *chinelos* in
[Brazil](Brazil "wikilink"), *japonki* in [Poland](Poland "wikilink"),
*dacas* in [Somalia](Somalia "wikilink"), *sayonares* (σαγιονάρες) in
[Greece](Greece "wikilink"), *slippers* in [Hawaii](Hawaii "wikilink"),
[Bahamas](Bahamas "wikilink"), [Trinidad and
Tobago](Trinidad_and_Tobago "wikilink") and the
[Netherlands](Netherlands "wikilink"), *infradito* in
[Italy](Italy "wikilink"), *djapanki* (джапанки) in
[Bulgaria](Bulgaria "wikilink"),"charlie wote" in Ghana, "japanke" in
Croatia and *vietnamki* in [Russia](Russia "wikilink") and
[Ukraine](Ukraine "wikilink"), *yezenes* in Latvia. They were introduced
by [Bata](Bata_Shoes "wikilink") in India under the brand name
[Hawaii](Hawaii "wikilink") slippers and are extremely popular
throughout the country.[8][9]

Thong sandals have been worn for thousands of years, dating back to
pictures of them in [ancient Egyptian](ancient_Egypt "wikilink") murals
from 4,000 BC. A pair found in [Europe](Europe "wikilink") was made of
[papyrus](papyrus "wikilink") leaves and
[dated](Carbon_dating "wikilink") to be approximately 1,500 years old.
These early versions of flip-flops were made from a wide variety of
materials. Ancient Egyptian sandals were made from papyrus and palm
leaves. The [Masai](Maasai_people "wikilink") of
[Africa](Africa "wikilink") made them out of
[rawhide](Rawhide_(textile) "wikilink"). In [India](India "wikilink"),
they were made from [wood](wood "wikilink"). In
[China](China "wikilink") and [Japan](Japan "wikilink"), [rice
straw](rice "wikilink") was used. The leaves of the
[sisal](sisal "wikilink") plant were used to make
[twine](twine "wikilink") for sandals in [South
America](South_America "wikilink"), while the natives of
[Mexico](Mexico "wikilink") used the [yucca](yucca "wikilink")
plant.[10]

The [Ancient Greeks](Ancient_Greece "wikilink") and
[Romans](Ancient_Rome "wikilink") wore versions of flip-flops as well.
In Greek sandals, the toe strap was worn between the first and second
toes, while Roman sandals had the strap between the second and third
toes. These differ from the sandals worn by the
[Mesopotamians](Mesopotamia "wikilink"), with the strap between the
third and fourth toes. In [India](India "wikilink"), a related *chappal*
("toe knob") sandal was common, with no straps but a small knob sitting
between the first and second toes. They are known as
[Padukas](Paduka "wikilink").[11]

The modern flip-flop became popular in the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") as soldiers returning from [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink") brought Japanese [zōri](zōri "wikilink")
with them. It caught on in the 1950s during the [postwar
boom](Post–World_War_II_economic_expansion "wikilink") and after the end
of hostilities of the [Korean War](Korean_War "wikilink"). As they
became adopted into American popular culture, the sandals were
redesigned and changed into the bright colors that dominated 1950s
design.[12] They quickly became popular due to their convenience and
comfort, and were popular in beach-themed stores and as summer
shoes.[13] During the 1960s, flip-flops became firmly associated with
the beach lifestyle of [California](California "wikilink"). As such,
they were promoted as primarily a [casual](casual_attire "wikilink")
accessory, typically worn with [shorts](shorts "wikilink"), [bathing
suits](bathing_suit "wikilink"), or summer dresses. As they became more
popular, some people started wearing them for dressier or more formal
occasions.[14]

In 1962, [Alpargatas](Alpargatas_S.A. "wikilink") marketed a version of
flip-flops known as [Havaianas](Havaianas "wikilink") in
[Brazil](Brazil "wikilink"). By 2010, more than 150 million pairs of
Havaianas were produced each year.[15] Flip-flops quickly became popular
as casual footwear of young adults. Girls would often decorate their
flip-flops with metallic finishes, charms, chains, beads,
[rhinestones](rhinestones "wikilink"), or other jewelry.[16] High-end
flip-flops made of leather or sophisticated synthetic materials are
commonly worn in place of sneakers or loafers as the standard, everyday
article of casual footwear, particularly among teenagers and young
adults, although it is not unusual to see older people wearing playful,
thick-soled flip-flops in brilliant colors. Platform and high-heel
variants began to appear in the 1990s.[17][18][19][20]

A minor controversy erupted in 2005 when some members of [Northwestern
University](Northwestern_University "wikilink")'s national champion
[women's lacrosse
team](Northwestern_Wildcats_women's_lacrosse "wikilink") visited the
[White House](White_House "wikilink") wearing flip-flops. The team
responded to critics by auctioning off their flip-flops on
[eBay](eBay "wikilink"), raising $1,653
[USD](United_States_Dollar "wikilink") for young
[cancer](cancer "wikilink") patient, Jaclyn Murphy of [Hopewell
Junction, New York](Hopewell_Junction,_New_York "wikilink"), who was
befriended by the team.[21] There is still a debate over whether this
signaled a fundamental change in American culture — many youth feel that
flip-flops are dressier and can be worn in a variety of social contexts,
while older generations feel that wearing them at formal occasions
signifies laziness and comfort over style.[22] In 2011, while
vacationing in his native [Hawaii](Hawaii "wikilink"), [Barack
Obama](Barack_Obama "wikilink") became the first [President of the
United States](President_of_the_United_States "wikilink") to be
photographed wearing a pair of flip-flops.[23][24] The [Dalai
Lama](Dalai_Lama "wikilink") of [Tibet](Tibet "wikilink") is also a
frequent wearer of flip-flops and has met with several U.S. presidents,
including [George W. Bush](George_W._Bush "wikilink") and [Barack
Obama](Barack_Obama "wikilink"), while wearing the sandals.[25][26]

While exact sales figures for flip-flops are difficult to obtain due to
the large number of stores and manufacturers involved, the Atlanta-based
company Flip Flop Shops claimed that the shoes were responsible for a
[$](United_States_Dollar "wikilink")20 billion industry in 2009.
Furthermore, sales of flip-flops exceeded those of
[sneakers](Sneakers_(footwear) "wikilink") for the first time in 2006.
If these figures are accurate, it is remarkable considering the low cost
of most flip-flops.[27]

## Design and custom

![](Havaianas.jpg "Havaianas.jpg")

The modern flip-flop has a very simple design, consisting of a thin
rubber sole with two straps running in a Y shape from the sides of the
foot to the gap between the big toe and the one beside it. They
typically do not have a strap around the heel, although heeled varieties
are available, as well as flip-flops designed for sports, which come
with added support common to [athletic shoes](athletic_shoe "wikilink"),
with the thong between the toes. Most modern flip-flops are inexpensive,
costing as little as [$](United_States_Dollar "wikilink")5 USD, or less
in some parts of the world.[28]

They are made from a wide variety of materials, as were the ancient
thong sandals. The modern sandals are made of more modern materials,
such as [rubber](rubber "wikilink"), [foam](foam "wikilink"),
[plastic](plastic "wikilink"), leather, [suede](suede "wikilink"), and
even fabric.[29] Thongs made of [polyurethane](polyurethane "wikilink")
have caused some environmental concerns; because polyurethane is a
[number 7 resin](Resin_identification_code "wikilink"), they can't be
easily discarded, and they persist in [landfills](landfill "wikilink")
for a very long time.[30] In response to these concerns, some companies
have begun selling flip-flops made from recycled rubber, such as that
from used bicycle tires, or even [hemp](hemp "wikilink"),[31] and some
offer a recycling program for used flip flops.[32]

Because of the strap between the toes, flip-flops are typically not worn
with [socks](sock "wikilink"). In colder weather, however, some people
wear flip-flops with [toe socks](toe_socks "wikilink").[33] The Japanese
commonly wear [tabi](tabi "wikilink"), a type of sock with a single slot
for the thong, with their [zōri](zōri "wikilink").[34]

## Health and medical implications and injuries

While flip-flops do provide the wearer with some mild protection from
hazards on the ground, such as hot [sand](sand "wikilink") at the beach,
glass, [thumb tacks](thumb_tack "wikilink") or even
[fungi](fungi "wikilink") and [wart](wart "wikilink")-causing viruses in
locker rooms or community pools, their simple design is responsible for
a host of other injuries of the foot and lower leg.[35]

Walking for long periods in flip-flops can be very tough on the feet,
resulting in pain in the [ankles](ankle "wikilink"),
[legs](leg "wikilink"), and [feet](foot "wikilink").[36] A 2009 study at
[Auburn University](Auburn_University "wikilink") found that flip-flop
wearers took shorter steps and their heels hit the ground with less
vertical force than those wearing athletic shoes.[37][38][39]
Individuals with [flat feet](flat_feet "wikilink") or other foot issues
are advised to wear a [shoe](shoe "wikilink") with better support.[40]

The lack of support provided by thong sandals is thought by some to be a
major cause of injuries. Some flip-flops have a spongy sole, causing the
foot to roll further inward than normal when it hits the ground
([over-pronation](pronation "wikilink")). Flip-flops can cause a person
to overuse the [tendons](tendon "wikilink") in their feet, resulting in
[tendonitis](tendonitis "wikilink").[41]

Ankle [sprains](sprain "wikilink") or broken bones are also common
injuries, due to stepping off a curb or tumbling; the ankle bends, but
the flip-flop neither holds on to nor supports it.[42] The straps of the
flip-flop may cause frictional issues, such as rubbing, during walking.
The open-toed nature of the thongs may result in cuts, scrapes, bruises,
or stubbed toes.[43] Despite all of these issues, flip-flops do not have
to be avoided completely. Many [podiatrists](podiatrist "wikilink")
recommend avoiding the inexpensive, drug store varieties and spending
more on sandals with thick-cushioned soles, as well as ones that have a
strap that's not canvas and that comes back almost to the ankle.[44]
