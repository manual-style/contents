**Flipsters** (flɪp-stərs) are folding shoes, designed in Australia by
L&M Designs. The footwear is produced in two styles:
[flip-flops](flip-flops "wikilink") and [ballet
flats](ballet_flat "wikilink"). Flipsters footwear fold into a pouch
which can be fit into a handbag and act as an alternative to standard
shoes.[1] The product is designed to "fit into a small handbag to give
stiletto-shoed feet a break"[2] The flip-flops are made with a 3-part
rubber sole and fabric heel guard that allows the shoe to collapse flat,
and while expanded provides support and structure similar to a standard
flip flop. Flipsters come in a pouch designed to keep the product
protected and clean. The product was designed with a triangle fold
designed to mimic the motion of natural walking.[3] Matt Schmidt, Editor
at "My Life News", described the innovative flipflop as "stylish and
comfy".[4]

## History

Flipsters were created in 2009 by law student Ben Lipschitz and
industrial designer Rick Munitz under the company L&M Designs. In
addition to its website, Flipsters are found in retail shops across
Australia, and the product is also exported to a number of other
countries outside of Australia.[5]

In May 2010 Flipsters was used to promote the
[Volkswagen](Volkswagen "wikilink")'s new product line, "[The
Polo](Volkswagen_Polo_GTI#Mk5_Polo_GTI "wikilink")". The founders of
Flipsters were invited by the company to speak about design and comfort
due to Volksvagen's intention to convey those message.[6] Unfortunately
it has become impossible recently, to buy these flip-flops from US
retailers that used to supply them.
