**Fuck-me shoes**, alternatively **fuck-me boots**, is a slang term for
women's [high-heeled shoes](high-heeled_shoe "wikilink") that exaggerate
a sexual image. The term can be applied to any women's shoes that are
worn with the intention of arousing others. It is sometimes used to
imply condemnation against the women who choose to wear them or in a
[misogynistic](misogyny "wikilink") fashion toward the women who wear
them.[1]

The term is similar in meaning to *kinky boots*, although typically
*kinky boots* refer more specifically to boots suited to a particular
[fetish](Fetish_fashion "wikilink").

## Term and usage

The phrase possibly originated in the United States, where two similar
terms are used: {{" '}}fuck-you shoes' implying a disregard for
convention or propriety, or 'fuck-off shoes' where 'fuck-off' means both
outsize and aggressive".[2] Tight trousers were called "come
[fuck](fuck "wikilink")-me's" as listed in a 1972 British dictionary of
slang, while a 1974 book is cited as making a reference to a person
wearing "a pair of fabulous 1940s-[Joan
Crawford](Joan_Crawford "wikilink")-fuck-me's".[3] The song "We are the
Dead" from [David Bowie](David_Bowie "wikilink")'s 1974 *[Diamond
Dogs](Diamond_Dogs "wikilink")* album mentions "fuck-me pumps."

Prominent feminist [Germaine Greer](Germaine_Greer "wikilink") brought
what had been an "obscure" term to more mainstream notoriety when she
used it in 1995. Greer used the term in referring to British journalist
[Suzanne Moore](Suzanne_Moore "wikilink")'s alleged "hair bird's-nested
all over the place, fuck-me shoes and three fat inches of cleavage".
Greer made the remark in response to a column Moore had written about
Greer in *[The Guardian](The_Guardian "wikilink")*, where Moore had
mistakenly repeated an incorrect rumor that Greer had a hysterectomy as
a voluntary decision to have herself sterilized.[4]

Greer was also quoted during the 1990s as criticizing a number of women
writers that she termed "lifestyle feminists"[5] who were, in her view,
espousing feminism at nothing more than a superficial level. Moore's
response was that her fashion choices were dictated by her own tastes
and not to please men: "as someone who grew up with
[punk](punk_rock "wikilink") and
[Madonna](Madonna_(entertainer) "wikilink"), I take it for granted that
women dress to please themselves and not men."[6]

Moore has said her footwear is "not worn just for the benefit of men",
implying that the intention is twofold, to please both her and
observers, although she also says "Most of the pleasure \[of buying
shoes\] involves a private fantasy that begins with me and ends at my
feet. Men don't get a look in."[7]

The incident, and the term, received coverage in British media and
beyond, and the term has become associated with Greer in popular
culture.[8] Greer had been denouncing [stiletto
shoes](stiletto_heel "wikilink") as symbols of women's subordination as
early as 1971.[9] She continues to use the phrase "fuck me shoes" in
public speaking when discussing gender and clothing styles society deems
appropriate.

The expression was further popularized when British jazz singer [Amy
Winehouse](Amy_Winehouse "wikilink") released the single "Pumps"
(originally titled "[Fuck Me Pumps](Fuck_Me_Pumps "wikilink")" on her
2003 album *[Frank](Frank_(Amy_Winehouse_album) "wikilink")*), a song
about gold diggers.

In January 2011, in a forum with teenaged students in [Cartagena,
Colombia](Cartagena,_Colombia "wikilink"), Greer noticed the popularity
of silicone [breast implants](breast_implants "wikilink") in the
audience. She asked students why they thought women tennis players wore
skirts, and asked why a young woman would choose to wear stiletto shoes:
"So you think the shoes are her fetish?Â ... I call them fuck-me shoes",
she said, "because you can't walk in them but you can wear them in
bed."[10]

### Cultural debate

The underlying conflict arises from the question of what is considered
an appropriate way for women to present their bodies in public spaces.
Some feminists have come to view criticisms of fashion choices to be
what they term "[slut-shaming](slut-shaming "wikilink")", an action they
view as misogynist, even when coming from other women. The development
of the [SlutWalk](SlutWalk "wikilink") protest demonstrations against
[dress codes](dress_codes "wikilink") is influenced by this position.

When [punk fashion](punk_fashion "wikilink") was on the rise during the
late 1970s, young women consciously played with the symbolism inherent
in their accessorizing, mixing choices that created a jarring visual
clash; leather was combined with lace, steel spikes with velvet,
stiletto heels with heavy ankle chains. The result was to exaggerate a
look of sexual aggression, turning {{" '}}fuck me' shoes into signifiers
of 'fuck you{{' "}}.[11] The punk influenced youth counterculture
continues with this trend, part of the wider trend of [fetish
fashion](fetish_fashion "wikilink").
