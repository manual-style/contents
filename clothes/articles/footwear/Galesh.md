A **galesh** (گالش) is a traditional footwear of Iran.

Unlike most [galoshes](galosh "wikilink"), the "galesh" are always
handwoven and with specific fabrics.

It is what people in [Persia](Persia "wikilink") used to wear before the
proliferation of the modern [shoe](shoe "wikilink"), especially in the
provinces of northern Iran.

Galesh are still made today, but in the category of handicrafts and
cultural produce.
