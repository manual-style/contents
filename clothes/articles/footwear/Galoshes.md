![](Galosh.jpg "fig:Galosh.jpg") **Galoshes**, also known as
**dickersons**, **gumshoes**, **rubbers**, or **overshoes**, are a type
of [rubber boot](rubber_boot "wikilink") that is slipped over
[shoes](shoe "wikilink") to keep them from getting muddy or wet. In the
United States, the word *galoshes* may be used interchangeably with
[boot](boot "wikilink"), especially a [rubberized
boot](Wellington_boot "wikilink"). In the United Kingdom, however, a
galosh is an overshoe made of a weatherproof material to protect a more
vulnerable shoe underneath and keep the foot warm and dry.

## Etymology and usage

The word comes through French (*galoche*) and Latin from Greek and
originally meant a shoemaker's last; literally "wood" + "foot".[1] By
the 14th century it had been transferred to [English style
clogs](Clog_(British) "wikilink"), that is those with a wooden sole and
fabric (e.g. leather) upper.[2] By 1572 the term also applied to "a
Gallage or Patten"; that is, an overshoe with a shaped wooden base to
raise the wearer's good shoes off the ground.[3]

In [Turkey](Turkey "wikilink"), the word refers to a polythene overshoe
that is worn temporarily when visiting homes or offices, to protect the
floors against dirt from the outside.

"Goloshes" appears to be the older spelling of *galoshes* used
previously in Great Britain. The spelling perhaps changed around 1920 to
the present-day spelling.[4][5][6]

## History

The transition from a traditional wooden sole to one of vulcanized
rubber may be attributed to [Charles
Goodyear](Charles_Goodyear "wikilink") and [Leverett
Candee](Leverett_Candee "wikilink"). The qualities of
[rubber](rubber "wikilink"), though fascinating to
[Goodyear](Charles_Goodyear "wikilink"), were highly dependent on
temperature: it was tacky when hot, brittle when cold.
[Vulcanization](Vulcanization "wikilink") of rubber tempered its
properties so that it was easily molded, durable, and tough. A
rubberized elastic webbing made Goodyear's galoshes (circa 1890) easy to
pull on and off.

Galoshes are now almost universally made of rubber. In the bootmakers'
trade, a "galosh" is the piece of [leather](leather "wikilink"), of a
make stronger than, or different from, that of the "uppers", which runs
around the bottom part of a boot or shoe, just above the sole.[7]

A more modern term for galoshes could be rubber boots or bad weather
shoes. Overshoes have evolved in the past decades and now are being made
with more advanced features, such as high traction outsoles.

An unconfirmed legend states that an Englishman named
[Radley](Radley "wikilink") invented galoshes. He suffered from
[rheumatism](rheumatism "wikilink") and wanted to keep his feet dry.
While reading [De Bello Gallico](De_Bello_Gallico "wikilink") by [Julius
Caesar](Julius_Caesar "wikilink") he noticed a description of protective
cloth overshoes "gallicae" and decided to capitalize on the idea. He
patented cloth overshoes reinforced with [rubber](rubber "wikilink") to
keep the feet dry.

There are also records of an inventor by the name of [Alvin Longo
Rickman](Alvin_Longo_Rickman "wikilink"), who received a patent for an
[overshoe](overshoe "wikilink") in 1898[8]

There are two basic types. One is like an oversize shoe or low boot made
of thick rubber with a heavy [sole](Sole_(shoe) "wikilink") and instep,
designed for heavy-duty use. The other one is of much thinner, more
flexible material, more like a rubber [slipper](slipper "wikilink"),
designed solely for protection against the wet rather than for extensive
walking.

## In popular culture

-   [Russian](Russia "wikilink") [FM](FM_broadcast_band "wikilink")
    [radio station](radio_station "wikilink") [Silver Rain
    Radio](Silver_Rain_Radio "wikilink") has presented a "Silver Galosh
    Award" (Serebrianaia kalosha or â€œSilver Kalosha") for the most
    dubious achievements in [show business](show_business "wikilink")
    every year since 1996. This references the Russian
    [idiom](idiom "wikilink") "to sit into a galosh", which means "to
    embarrass oneself" or "to screw up".
-   [Gummo Marx](Gummo_Marx "wikilink"), the fifth of the [Marx
    brothers](Marx_brothers "wikilink"), who quit the act during the
    family's vaudeville days and thus never appeared in a [Marx Brothers
    film](Marx_Brothers_film "wikilink"), was nicknamed by [Art
    Fisher](Art_Fisher "wikilink") based on his habit of *always*
    wearing gumshoes. While all the other performers wore street shoes,
    and thus made a loud noise when they walked on a hardwood stage,
    Milton (Gummo) was known for startling people by appearing suddenly
    from out of nowhere, because the gumshoes on his feet gave him a
    nearly soundless footfall. Gumshoes however, were neither Galoshes
    nor overshoes. They were street shoes with a thick, soft, and quiet
    rubber or crepe rubber sole.
-   [Hans Christian Andersen](Hans_Christian_Andersen "wikilink") wrote
    a fairy tale *[The Goloshes of
    Fortune](The_Goloshes_of_Fortune "wikilink")* about magic galoshes
    which made every wish of their bearers true, but this often didn't
    bring them real fortune or happiness. There are children's movies
    based on this tale, *The Magic Galoshes*
    ([Czechoslovakia](Czechoslovakia "wikilink") \|
    [Austria](Austria "wikilink") \|
    [Germany](Germany "wikilink"), 1986) and
    [Russian](Russia "wikilink") *Galoshi schastya* ().
-   [James Joyce](James_Joyce "wikilink")'s short story "[The
    Dead](The_Dead_(short_story) "wikilink")" discusses "goloshes".
-   The anti-Bolshevik scientist of [Mikhail
    Bulgakov](Mikhail_Bulgakov "wikilink")'s story [Heart of a
    Dog](Heart_of_a_Dog "wikilink") traces the downfall of Russian
    civilization to the disappearance of all the galoshes from the front
    hall of his apartment building (where they were previously stored
    without the fear of thieves) one fine day of March 1917.
-   In the book *[Big Nate on a Roll](Big_Nate_on_a_Roll "wikilink")*,
    Mr. Galvin says he sold galoshes as a child when he was a Timber
    Scout. He says that when Nate is shown drawing his dream skateboard,
    which he can win if he raises money selling cheesey wall hangings.
    It is the first time Mr. Galvin is nice to Nate.
-   In the *[Star Trek](Star_Trek "wikilink")* episode "[A Piece of the
    Action](A_Piece_of_the_Action_(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series) "wikilink")",
    [Scotty](Scotty_(Star_Trek) "wikilink") makes reference to "concrete
    galoshes", which is another term for "[cement
    overshoes](cement_shoes "wikilink")", used by the
    [Mafia](Mafia "wikilink") to dispose of their victims.
-   In the stop-motion holiday special, *[Here Comes Peter
    Cottontail](Here_Comes_Peter_Cottontail "wikilink")*, the [Vincent
    Price](Vincent_Price "wikilink")-voiced villain, January Q.
    Irontail, makes plans to replace the traditional [Easter
    bonnet](Easter_bonnet "wikilink") with *Easter galoshes*.
-   In the *[Mighty Boosh](Mighty_Boosh "wikilink")* episode "[The
    Strange Tale of the Crack
    Fox](The_Mighty_Boosh_(series_3) "wikilink")", the Crack Fox asks
    Vince to move his galoshes before sitting down, referring to a pair
    of used [condoms](condom "wikilink") he calls "squishy boots".
-   In the *[Adventure Time](Adventure_Time "wikilink")* episode "The
    Jiggler", Finn and Jake comment that their exploded pet Jiggler is
    "all over the place, even between the floorboards, and the cupboards
    and the galoshes", which appear to be just a regular pair of rain
    boots.
