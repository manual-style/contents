are a form of traditional [Japanese](Japan "wikilink") footwear that
resemble [clogs](clogs "wikilink") and
[flip-flops](flip-flops "wikilink"). They are a kind of
[sandal](sandal_(footwear) "wikilink") with an elevated wooden base held
onto the foot with a fabric [thong](thong_sandal "wikilink") to keep the
foot well above the ground.

## History

, who were high-ranking [courtesans](courtesans "wikilink") of the
feudal period in [Japan](Japan "wikilink"), wore tall, lacquered
koma-geta or mitsu-ashi (literally, "three legs"). Whereas
*[geisha](geisha "wikilink")* and *[maiko](maiko "wikilink")* wear
*[tabi](tabi "wikilink")* socks, the *oiran* and
*[tayū](tayū "wikilink")* preferred not to do so (even in winter) and
their toes can be seen poking out under many layers of *kimono* while
wearing these tall *geta*. These shoes were most likely worn to ensure
there was no confusion between *geisha*, *maiko* and *oiran* / *tayū*.
One sometimes sees maiko hobbling along in *okobo*, but the pace must
have been even more arduous in these tall *geta*.

Merchants used very high geta (two long teeth) to keep the feet well
above the seafood scraps on the floor

## Use

Geta are primarily worn with *[yukata](yukata "wikilink")*, but
sometimes also with Western clothing during the summer months. As geta
are usually worn only with yukata or other informal Japanese clothes or
Western clothes, there is no need to wear socks. Ordinarily, people wear
slightly more formal [zōri](zōri "wikilink") when wearing
*[tabi](tabi "wikilink")*.

### In weather

Sometimes geta are worn in rain to keep the feet dry, due to their extra
height and impermeability compared to other footwear such as *zōri*.
They make a similar noise to flip-flops slapping against the heel whilst
walking. When worn on water or dirt, flip-flops may flip dirt or water
up the back of the legs. This does not tend to happen with the heavier
Japanese geta.

Geta are not normally worn in snow, because snow often gets stuck to the
teeth of the geta, making it difficult to walk. However, in historical
times, such as in the picture to the right, they were worn in the
snow.![](Brooklyn_Museum_-_Woodblock_print_-_Utagawa_Toyokuni_III_(Kunisada).jpg "fig:Brooklyn_Museum_-_Woodblock_print_-_Utagawa_Toyokuni_III_(Kunisada).jpg")

## Styles

There are several different styles of *geta*. The most familiar style
consists of an unfinished wooden board called a that the foot is set
upon, with a that passes between the big toe and second toe.

![](Geta2.JPG "fig:Geta2.JPG") The two supporting pieces below the base
board, called , are also made of wood, usually very light-weight and
make a distinctive "clacking" sound while walking: . This is sometimes
mentioned as one of the sounds that older Japanese miss most in modern
life. A traditional saying in Japanese translates as "You don't know
until you have worn *geta*." This means roughly, "you can't tell the
results until the game is over."

The original motivation for wearing the high platform shoes was not
fashion, but practical: to keep feet from coming in contact with things
on the ground, e.g. dirt, filth, water, or snow.

The *dai* may vary in shape: oval ("more feminine") to rectangular
("more masculine") and color (natural, lacquered, or stained). The *ha*
may also vary in style; for example, *[tengu](tengu "wikilink")-geta*
have only a single centered "tooth". There are also less common geta
with three teeth.

### Geisha

*[Maiko](Maiko_(geiko) "wikilink")* (*[geisha](geisha "wikilink")* in
training) wear distinctive tall geta called *[okobo](okobo "wikilink")*
which are similar to the [chopines](chopine "wikilink") worn in
[Venice](Venice "wikilink") during the
[Renaissance](Renaissance "wikilink"). Also very young girls wear okobo,
also called "pokkuri" and "koppori", that have a small bell inside a
cavity in the thick "sole". These geta have no "teeth" but are formed of
one piece of wood. The middle part is carved out from below and the
front is sloped to accommodate for walking. Pokkuri are usually red in
color and are not worn with yukata, but a very fancy kimono (such as at
*[shichi-go-san](Shichi-Go-San "wikilink")* festivals). Okobo are
usually worn with tabi.

## Construction

Geta are made of one piece of solid wood forming the sole and two wooden
blocks underneath. These blocks may have a metal plate on the section
that touches the ground in order to lengthen the life span of the geta.
A V-shaped thong of cloth forms the upper part of the sandal.

The teeth are usually not separate, instead, the geta is carved from one
block of wood. The tengu tooth is, however, strengthened by a special
attachment. The teeth of any geta may have harder wood drilled into the
bottom to avoid splitting, and the soles of the teeth may have rubber
soles glued onto them.

The *hanao* can be wide and padded, or narrow and hard, and it can be
made with many sorts of fabric. Printed cotton with traditional Japanese
motifs is popular, but there are also geta with vinyl and leather
*hanao*. Inside the *hanao* is a cord (recently synthetic, but
traditionally [hemp](hemp "wikilink")) that is knotted in a special way
to the three holes of the *dai*. In the wide *hanao* there is some
padding as well. The *hanao* are replaceable. It sits between the two
first toes because having the thong of rectangular geta anywhere but the
middle would result in the inner back corners of the geta colliding when
walking. Recently, as Western shoes have become more popular, more
Western looking geta have been developed. They are more round in shape,
may have an ergonomically shaped *dai*, a thick heel as in Western
clogs, instead of separate teeth, and the thong at the side as in
flip-flops. According to Japanese
[superstition](superstition "wikilink"), breaking the thong on one's
geta is considered very unlucky.[1]
