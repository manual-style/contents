![](Giveh-senejan.jpg "fig:Giveh-senejan.jpg") **Giveh** or **Givah** (,
[Kurdish](Kurdish_languages "wikilink"):کەڵاش)is a kind of soft,
comfortable, durable and handwoven-top shoe common in several parts of
[Iran](Iran "wikilink") especially in rural and mountainous areas of
[Kermanshah Province](Kermanshah_Province "wikilink"). The production
centers of Giveh are the two provinces of
[Yazd](Yazd_Province "wikilink") and Kermanshah in Iran.

Giveh is made up of two parts: sole and upper. The sole is usually
rubber or leather the upper is woven thread. Before the arrival of
rubber industry to the area, Giveh-makers would use a kind of wild-bull
leather to make giveh and the upper was of wool or cotton thread. Most
rich people would wear them. With the arrival of rubber industry,
lower-class people have used rubber in the sole of their givehs.
