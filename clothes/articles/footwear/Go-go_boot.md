**Go-go boots** are a low-heeled style of women's fashion
[boot](boot "wikilink") first introduced in the mid-1960s. The original
go-go boots, as defined by [Andr√© Courr√®ges](Andr√©_Courr√®ges "wikilink")
in 1964, were white, low-heeled, and mid-calf in height,[1] a specific
style which is sometimes called the **Courr√®ges boot**.[2][3] Since
then, the term go-go boot has come to include the knee-high, square-toed
boots with block heels that were very popular in the 1960s and 1970s; as
well as a number of variations including [kitten
heeled](kitten_heel "wikilink") versions and colours other than
white.[4][5]

## Etymology

The term *go-go* is derived from the
[French](French_language "wikilink") expression *[√
gogo](wikt:√†_gogo#French "wikilink")*, meaning "in abundance,
galore",[6] which is in turn derived from the ancient French word *la
gogue* for "joy, happiness".[7] The term "go-go" has also been explained
as a 1964 [back-formation](back-formation "wikilink") of the 1962 slang
term "go", meaning something that was "all the rage"; the term "[go-go
dancer](go-go_dancing "wikilink")" first appeared in print in 1965.[8]
The go-go boot is presumed to have been named after the dance
style.[9][10]

## 1960s

Fashion boots were revived in the early 1960s by designers such as [Beth
Levine](Beth_Levine_(fashion_designer) "wikilink"), although at first
they featured fashionable high heels such as the
[stiletto](stiletto_heel "wikilink") and [kitten
heels](kitten_heel "wikilink").[11] The earliest go-go boots were
mid-calf, white and flat-heeled, as seen in the work of the designer
[Andr√© Courr√®ges](Andr√©_Courr√®ges "wikilink"), who is often credited
with creating the style.[12][13] The simple minimalism of the Courr√®ges
boot was easily and widely reproduced for the mass market.[14][15]
Courr√®ges boots provided the foundation for the development of the go-go
boot, which increasingly came higher up the leg and was made in
alternative colours.[16][17] While remaining low-ish, the heel also
became higher and chunkier.[18] The earliest Courr√®ges boots were made
of leather, such as [kidskin](kidskin "wikilink") or [patent
leather](patent_leather "wikilink"),[19] but many of the subsequent
versions and copies were made in [PVC](PVC "wikilink"),
[vinyl](Vinyl_group "wikilink"), and other plastics.[20]

In 1966, the song "[These Boots Are Made for
Walkin'](These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin' "wikilink")" was released and
performed by a go-go boot wearing [Nancy
Sinatra](Nancy_Sinatra "wikilink"), who is credited with further
popularising the boot.[21] [Tim Gunn](Tim_Gunn "wikilink") suggests that
Sinatra helped establish the boot as "a symbol of female power".[22]
Female dancers on the television shows
*[Hullabaloo](Hullabaloo_(TV_series) "wikilink")* and
*[Shindig!](Shindig! "wikilink")* also wore the short, white boots.[23]
This led to the boots sometimes being called 'hullabaloo boots,' as in
an advertisement run in American newspapers in January 1966 for
hullabaloo boots with "kooky heels and zipper backs" for the "Go-Go
Getter".[24]

## Post-1960s

In the mid-1990s, as part of a general revival of 1960s fashions, go-go
boots came back into style.[25]
