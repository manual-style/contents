The **Golden Gumboot** is a competition between the [Far North
Queensland](Far_North_Queensland "wikilink") towns of
[Tully](Tully,_Queensland "wikilink"),
[Innisfail](Innisfail,_Queensland "wikilink"), and
[Babinda](Babinda,_Queensland "wikilink") in
[Australia](Australia "wikilink") for the wettest town of Australia.
These towns are located in the [Wet Tropics](Wet_Tropics "wikilink") and
on land that was previously covered by
[rainforest](rainforest "wikilink"). These areas experience some of the
highest levels of [rainfall](rainfall "wikilink") in Australia through
[monsoonal](monsoon "wikilink") [rain](rain "wikilink") and
[cyclones](cyclone "wikilink"). The winner for the competition (since
1970) was awarded a [rubber](rubber "wikilink") [boot](boot "wikilink").

Despite the fact that Babinda has had more rainfall than Tully in the
last 40 years, The Golden Gumboot monument was erected in Tully by the
Tully [Lions](Lions_Club "wikilink") and
[Rotary](Rotary_club "wikilink") Clubs on 10 May 2003. The project cost,
including in-kind contributions, was $90,000. The official opening took
place on 10 May 2003. The boot stands at 7.9 metres (25.9Â ft) and
represents the record rainfall for Tully in 1950. The boot is composed
of [fibreglass](fibreglass "wikilink") and has a spiral staircase to the
top of the boot that allows a view of the town. Historical photographs
of floods in the district are displayed on the walls inside the boot for
visitors to view as they climb to the top. The Gumboot was designed,
fabricated and installed by Brian Newell.

Tully holds a Golden Gumboot Festival annually.

The Golden Gumboot was closed after [Cyclone
Yasi](Cyclone_Yasi "wikilink") in 2011, but was reopened early in 2012
by [Andrew Fraser](Andrew_Fraser_(Queensland_politician) "wikilink"),
the Acting Premier of Queensland.[1] Restoration was funding through an
insurance claim and a $20,000 donation.[2]
