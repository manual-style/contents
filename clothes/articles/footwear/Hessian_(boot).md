![](Churchill,_uniform.jpg "fig:Churchill,_uniform.jpg"), 1895\]\] The
**Hessian** (; from [Hesse](Hesse "wikilink") in
[Germany](Germany "wikilink")) is a style of light
[boot](boot "wikilink") that became popular from the beginning of the
19th century.[1]

## History and description

First worn by German soldiers in the 18th century, these military riding
boots became popular in England, particularly during the [Regency
period](Regency_period "wikilink") (1811â€“1820), with their polished
leather and ornamental tassels. Initially used as standard issue
footwear for light cavalry regiments, especially
[hussars](hussars "wikilink"), they would become widely worn by
civilians as well.[2]

The boots had a low heel, and a semi-pointed toe that made them
practical for mounted troops, as they allowed easy use of
[stirrups](stirrup "wikilink").[3] They reached to the knee and had a
decorative tassel at the top of each shaft, with a "v" notch in
front.[4] The Hessian boot would evolve into the rubber work boots known
as "[wellies](Wellington_boot "wikilink")" and the [cowboy
boot](cowboy_boot "wikilink").
