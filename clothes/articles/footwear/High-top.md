![](Fila_foggia.jpg "fig:Fila_foggia.jpg") The **high-top** is a
[shoe](shoe "wikilink") that extends slightly over the wearer's
[ankle](ankle "wikilink"). It is commonly an
[athletic](Sport "wikilink") shoe, particularly for
[basketball](basketball "wikilink"). It is sometimes confused with the
slightly shorter mid-top, which typically extends no higher than the
wearer's ankle. High-tops also should not be confused with
shorter-length boots such as ankle boots, since high-tops usually refer
to [athletic shoes](athletic_shoes "wikilink"), although can also refer
to other above-ankle shoes such as some [hiking
boots](hiking_boots "wikilink").

Examples of basketball shoes that are high-tops are [Converse
All-Stars](Converse_All-Stars "wikilink"), [Nike Air Forces 1, 2, and
3](Air_Force_1_(shoe) "wikilink"), [Reebok
Freestyle](Reebok_Freestyle "wikilink"), Reebok BB4600, [Nike Air
Yeezy](Nike_Air_Yeezy "wikilink") and Foggia Hi LTD from
[Fila](Fila_(company) "wikilink"). Others include skateboarding
sneakers, such as the [Vans](Vans "wikilink") Vault Hi Fi LX which are
quite supportive to the wearer's ankles and are useful to those with
[hypermobility](Hypermobility_(joints) "wikilink") and [fallen
arches](flat_feet "wikilink").

## Design

While most high-top sneakers take the form of either the [Converse
All-Stars](Converse_All-Stars "wikilink") or [Nike Air Forces 1, 2, and
3](Air_Force_1_(shoe) "wikilink"), high-top CVO (Circular Vamp Oxford)
cover the ankle and also have a circular vamp. They come in both lace up
and slip-on, thought the slip-on version is very rare. In [British
English](British_English "wikilink") these would be high-top
[plimsolls](plimsolls "wikilink") again either in lace up or slip-on.
Various manufacturers and models exist, including
[Keds](Keds "wikilink"), [Pro-Keds](Pro-Keds "wikilink"), and
[Converse](Converse_(shoe_company) "wikilink"). These exist for all
genders and all age ranges. The shoes have recently come back in style
in 2014, espically white ones.

Some [dress and casual shoes](Shoe#Dress_and_casual "wikilink") may also
be as high-tops.
