![](Hiking_shoes_Lowa.jpg "fig:Hiking_shoes_Lowa.jpg") **Hiking
(walking) boots** are footwear specifically designed for protecting the
feet and ankles during outdoor walking activities such as
[hiking](hiking "wikilink"). They are one of the most important items of
hiking gear, since their quality and durability can determine a hiker's
ability to walk long distances without injury. Hiking boots are
constructed to provide comfort for walking considerable distance over
rough terrain. Boots that protect the hiker's feet and heel are
recommended. Hiking boots give ankle support and are fairly stiff.[1] A
less popular alternative is to use light [trainers](trainers "wikilink")
with thin soles. Footwear should be neither too loose nor too tight, to
help prevent blisters and sore feet. Hiking socks that wick sweat from
the feet, provide warmth, and cushion the feet are recommended and a
thin, inner sock may also help.[2] Most hiking boots are also designed
for other outdoor activities such as
[backpacking](backpacking_(wilderness) "wikilink"),
[climbing](climbing "wikilink"),
[mountaineering](mountaineering "wikilink"), and
[hunting](hunting "wikilink").

## Types

![](Karrimor.JPG "fig:Karrimor.JPG") hiking trainer.\]\] There are three
main types of walking footwear.[3][4]

1.  **Trail shoes** are made for hiking in dry climates, on
    well-established, less rugged or rocky paths. They are suitable for
    many types of day hikes.
2.  **Trail hikers** are for steeper inclines and muddy paths. They are
    used where a lightweight boot is most suitable. Trail hikers are
    also sturdy, higher-cut, and watertight. These boots provide more
    stability and ankle protection against protruding limbs and rocks
    than hiking shoes do.
3.  **Mountain walking or hiking boots** are designed for mountain and
    hill walking, backpacking and mountaineering. Crampons can be
    attached to them for a better grip on glaciers or hard-packed snow.
    They are extremely strong, durable, and have stiff soles to give the
    ankles support and protection on difficult rocky trails.
    [Mountaineering boots](Mountaineering_boot "wikilink") are usually
    taller and stiffer than hiking boots, providing insulation as well
    as support and protection.[5]

## Parts

1.  Upper - The upper part of a hiking boot is intended to protect and
    support the foot with an all-over snug fit. Uppers should be water
    repellent/proof, but allow the feet to breathe to prevent excess
    moisture from causing blisters and other discomfort.[6]
2.  Soles - Hiking boots have deep-lugged soles of tough rubber to
    provide friction and avoid slipping on any surfaces. Soles absorb
    and redirect shocks, and provides cushion for the feet.
3.  Tongues - The flaps that cover the inlet of the upper are called
    tongues. This is the part the goes underneath the laces. Tongues
    make sure that water, dirt and debris will not enter the boots.
4.  Linings and Paddings - Linings and paddings provide more protection
    and comfort for the feet.
5.  [Insoles](Insole#Insole "wikilink") / Foot beds - Insoles are the
    bottom part of the inner that the feet rest on. Insoles that are
    perfectly shaped to the hiker's feet will ensure maximum support and
    balance.
6.  [Shanks](Shank_(footwear) "wikilink") - The stiff plastic or metal
    plates built into the sole. Boots are made with full, three-quarter,
    or half-length shanks. Longer shanks make for stiffer boots.
7.  Scree Collars - Protects the Achilles tendon and ankle from chafing.
8.  Crampon Connections - [Crampons](Crampons "wikilink") are worn on
    boots to provide traction on snow and ice.

## Rubber boots

Most are constructed of leather, sometimes with a [breathable
waterproof](waterproof_breathable_fabric "wikilink") lining, such as
[Gore-Tex](Gore-Tex "wikilink"). However, the shoes are not comparable
to [rubber boots](rubber_boots "wikilink") when it comes to being
waterproof and drying quickly, making it difficult to cross rivers while
keeping the inside of the boot dry. Although there are rubber lace-up
boots designed for hiking purposes, rubber hiking boots are not ideal
for extensive use because the feet cannot breathe and sweat extensively,
which can lead to foot problems such as blisters, fungal infections and
[trench foot](trench_foot "wikilink"). These drawbacks negate any
advantage rubber boots have in keeping out external moisture. However
non-rubber hiking boots are generally quite expensive and require more
care.
