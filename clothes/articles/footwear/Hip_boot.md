**Hip boots**, or **hip [waders](waders_(footwear) "wikilink")** as they
are sometimes called, are a type of tall [boot](boot "wikilink")
initially designed to be worn by river
[fishermen](fishermen "wikilink"). Hip boots are typically made out of
[rubber](rubber "wikilink"), and completely cover the legs, up to the
tops of the thighs or all the way up to the waist. Hip boots are
designed to protect the fisherman from water, and allow wading out into
deeper waters in hopes of getting a bigger catch. They also help to keep
the feet and legs warm in autumn and winter. Hip boots are also worn by
many ecologists and environmental scientists who do tests in swamps or
lakes to determine the quality of water.

Hip boots are necessary footwear during flooding, and can be a part of
everyday city raingear in order to protect from heavy showers (currently
most popular in [Japan](Japan "wikilink") and
[Russia](Russia "wikilink") as female footwear, usually worn with
[jeans](jeans "wikilink") and [raincoat](raincoat "wikilink")).
