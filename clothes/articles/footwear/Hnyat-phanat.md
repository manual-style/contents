![](Hnyat-phanat.jpg "fig:Hnyat-phanat.jpg") **Hnyat-phanat** (, ) is a
Burmese traditional [sandal](sandal "wikilink"), similar to
[flip-flops](flip-flops "wikilink"). Although it refers to almost any
sandal worn by the people of [Myanmar](Myanmar "wikilink"), it is mostly
used to refer to the traditional Mandalay [velvet](velvet "wikilink")
slippers that originate in Upper Burma (Myanmar).

Hnyat-phanat literally means 'clip footwear', since the slipper is held
in place by the clipping of the big and second toe.

## Design and style

The slipper is very simple and is worn by almost everybody in Myanmar.
It consists of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a Y-shaped strap
that passes between the first (big) and second toes and around either
side of the foot. The main distinguishing feature of Burmese traditional
sandals is the material.

The flat sole is plain with no patterns or designs. It is either coated
with fine soft lacquer or velvet ( *gadiba*), and the same goes for the
Y strap. The colour is usually either brown or black for the lacquered
ones, but can vary substantially for the velvet slippers. Velvet sandals
are traditionally worn at formal occasions like weddings.

Burmese sandals do not have any grip or friction on the lower side of
the sole, and are thus not suitable for use in wet conditions.
