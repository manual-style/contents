Huarache}} ![](Huaraches,_on_ground.jpg "fig:Huaraches,_on_ground.jpg")
**Huaraches** are an open type of [outdoor](outdoor "wikilink")
[footwear](footwear "wikilink"), consisting of a
[sole](Sole_(shoe) "wikilink") held to the wearer's foot by straps
passing over the [instep](instep "wikilink") and around the
[ankle](ankle "wikilink"). The common understanding is that these
sandals were a variant of traditional Mexican
[huaraches](Huarache_(shoe) "wikilink"), the difference being in design
and construction.[1]

These sandals are favoured by [minimalist
runners](Minimalist_shoe "wikilink") for several reasons. They force the
foot and the runner to run with a natural gait. They also help protect
the foot from glass, gravel, and other debris.[2]

In [Christopher McDougall](Christopher_McDougall "wikilink")'s book
*[Born to
Run](Born_to_Run:_A_Hidden_Tribe,_Superathletes,_and_the_Greatest_Race_the_World_Has_Never_Seen "wikilink")*
the author describes the [Raramuri](Raramuri "wikilink") of the Mexican
[Copper Canyons](Copper_Canyon "wikilink") teaching a fellow runner how
to build huaraches.[3]

## Design

![](Man_running,_wearing_huaraches_(running_shoe).jpg "fig:Man_running,_wearing_huaraches_(running_shoe).jpg")
The primary design difference from traditional huaraches is in the
straps that cover the front of the foot. In the traditional sandals, the
straps are woven in an intricate design. In the variant used for
running, the straps are much simpler and less ornate.[4]

## Construction

Huaraches were originally made from leather, and later from the
[tread](tire_tread "wikilink") of used automobile tires. Since then,
rubber manufactured as replacement outsole for shoes, such as the
[Vibram](Vibram "wikilink") Cherry, has been used. More recently,
commercial manufactureres have created pre-cut rubber soles for the
construction of huaraches. Additionally, some manufacturers create soles
shaped to custom outline of the wearer's feet.[5]

The [laces](shoelaces "wikilink") for huaraches are either synthetic,
hemp or [leather](leather "wikilink"). Synthetic laces are usually made
of [polyester](polyester "wikilink") or [nylon](nylon "wikilink").
Generally shoelaces are of narrow construction, and thin cordage similar
to [parachute cord](parachute_cord "wikilink") is used.[6]
