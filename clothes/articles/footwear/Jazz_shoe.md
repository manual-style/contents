![](AcroShoes.jpg "fig:AcroShoes.jpg") A **jazz shoe** is a type of
[shoe](shoe "wikilink") worn by [dancers](dancer "wikilink"). They are
used in [jazz dance](jazz_dance "wikilink") and other styles of dance
including [acro dance](acro_dance "wikilink"), [acrobatic
rock'n'roll](acrobatic_rock'n'roll "wikilink"), and [hip
hop](hip_hop "wikilink"), and in other activities, such as
[aerobics](aerobics "wikilink").

Jazz shoes are available in a variety of styles, with varying features.
They may be high-rise or low-rise, and may be
[slip-ons](slip-on_(shoe) "wikilink") or lace-up
[Oxfords](Oxford_(shoe) "wikilink"). Split-sole jazz shoes allow enhance
shoe flexibility, making it possible to flex the foot more easily. Most
have rubber soles, which provide traction and also help to cushion the
foot, and some have thicker heels for better shock-absorption. Jazz
shoes typically come in a tan or black color. Some have a
[suede](suede "wikilink") patch under the ball of the foot to facilitate
turning. [1]
