**Jipsin** are Korean traditional [sandals](sandal "wikilink") made of
[straw](straw "wikilink"). Koreans have worn straw sandals since ancient
times. They are categorized as *yi* (Ïù¥, ), shoes with a short height,
and the specific name can vary according to the materials used, as with
*samsin*, *wanggolsin*, *cheongol jisin*, and *budeulsin.*[1] In the
[Joseon period](Joseon_period "wikilink"), jipsin were worn mostly by
commoners, working farmers, and scholars while on outings. Today's
Jipsin style is inherited from the Joseon period.
