The **G.R. Kinney Company** was an
[American](United_States_of_America "wikilink") manufacturer and
retailer of shoes from 1894[1] until September 16, 1998.[2] Its listing
on the [New York Stock Exchange](New_York_Stock_Exchange "wikilink"),
symbol KNN, began in March 1923.[3] The shoe concern was started by
George Romanta Kinney whose father ran a [general
store](general_store "wikilink") in rural [Candor, New
York](Candor,_New_York "wikilink"). The father became indebted and
George vowed to repay his indebtedness. In 1894, at the age of 28, he
had saved enough to purchase a Lester retail outlet in [Waverly, New
York](Waverly,_Tioga_County,_New_York "wikilink"). Lester Shoe of
[Binghamton, New York](Binghamton,_New_York "wikilink") was the
predecessor to the [Endicott Johnson
Corporation](Endicott_Johnson_Corporation "wikilink"). Kinney succeeded
by selling affordably priced shoes to working Americans.[4]

The [business chain](business_chain "wikilink") numbered 362 stores at
the conclusion of 1929, with 44 of these opening in the final year of
the decade.[5] [Foot Locker](Foot_Locker "wikilink") began as a division
of the Kinney Shoe Corporation in 1974.[6]

## Chain and later a subsidiary

Kinney Shoes was the largest family chain shoe retailer in the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") at the beginning of 1936, with 335
stores operating nationwide.[7] Although it was selling more shoes at
the conclusion of 1936 than in 1929, its dollar volume was 20% to 30%
below 1929.[8]

On August 31, 1963, the G.R. Kinney Company was sold to [F.W.
Woolworth](F.W._Woolworth "wikilink").[9] Prior to this it was a
subsidiary of the [Brown Shoe Company](Brown_Shoe_Company "wikilink")
which sold it for $45 million.[10] The firm was renamed the Kinney Shoe
Corporation and continued as a fully owned subsidiary of Woolworth.[11]
It retained its own eleven member board of directors and an existing
panel of corporate officers.

## Foot Locker exclusivity

The company continued operating throughout the 1960s and 1970s with
divisions named Stylco (1967), Susie Casuals (1968), and Foot Locker
(1974).[12] On September 16, 1998, the [Venator
Group](Venator_Group "wikilink"), Woolworth's successor, announced that
Kinney's 467 shoe stores and 103 Footquarters stores would close. The
Foot Locker division, started in 1974, continues to this day, with
Venator changing its name in 2001 to Foot Locker.[13] Foot Locker also
maintains the trademarks of the Kinney and Woolworth brands.
