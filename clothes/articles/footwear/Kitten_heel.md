![](1950_woman_shoe1.JPG "fig:1950_woman_shoe1.JPG") A **kitten heel**
is a short [stiletto heel](stiletto_heel "wikilink"), usually from 3.5
centimeters (1.5 inches) to 4.75 centimeters (1.75 inches) high, with a
slight curve setting the heel in from the back edge of the shoe. The
style was popularized by [Audrey Hepburn](Audrey_Hepburn "wikilink"),[1]
and recent followers of the fashion include [Theresa
May](Theresa_May "wikilink"), [Michelle
Obama](Michelle_Obama "wikilink"), and [Hillary
Clinton](Hillary_Clinton "wikilink").[2]

Shoes with kitten heels may be worn at work in an office setting by
people who wish to wear feminine attire that is still practical. For
parties, kitten heels are an alternative for those who find high heels
uncomfortable. Further, kitten heels are also worn by teenagers, who may
be considered too young for high heels.

## Definition

Kitten heels are shoes with a tapered heel of approximately 2.5 to 5
centimeters (1–2 in) in height. They are on the shorter end of stiletto
shoes, which can have heels as tall as 12.5 centimeters (5 in).[3]

## History

Kitten heels were introduced in the late 1950s as formal fashion attire
for young adolescent girls, as higher heels would have been considered
unseemly for girls as young as thirteen because of, for instance, unease
of walk. They were sometimes referred to as "trainer heels" in the US,
indicating their use in getting young girls used to wearing high heels.
However, by the early 1960s, they became fashionable for older teenagers
and eventually for women of all ages. The demise of the [stiletto
heel](stiletto_heel "wikilink") in the late 1960s meant that women could
choose between a wider variety of intermediate length heels, which
decreased the appeal of the kitten heel. However, the kitten heel
reemerged in the 1980s along with [wedge heels](wedge_heel "wikilink"),
and have become once again fashionable since 2003, but are not made in
abundance due to the preference for stiletto heels by women during this
time period.
