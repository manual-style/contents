red painting on top makes the clogs look like leather shoes. It is a
traditional motif on painted clogs.\]\] A **klomp** (plural **klompen**)
is a whole-foot [clog](clog "wikilink") from the
[Netherlands](Netherlands "wikilink").

## Usage

Approximately 3 million pairs of klompen are made each year.[1] They are
sold throughout the Netherlands. A large part of the market is for
tourist souvenirs. However, some Dutch people, particularly
[farmers](Agriculture "wikilink"), [market
gardeners](Greenhouse#Netherlands "wikilink"), and
[gardeners](gardening "wikilink") still wear them for everyday use.
Outside the tourist industry, klompen can be found in local tool shops
and [garden centers](Garden_centre "wikilink").

The traditional all-wooden Dutch clogs have been officially accredited
as safety shoes with the [CE mark](CE_mark "wikilink") and can withstand
almost any penetration including sharp objects and concentrated acids.
They are actually safer than steelcapped protective shoes in some
circumstances, as the wood cracks rather than dents in extreme
accidents, allowing easy removal of the clog and not continued pressure
on the toes by the (edge of the) steel nose.[2]
