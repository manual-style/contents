The **kung fu shoe**, also known as a "[Tai Chi](Tai_Chi "wikilink")
shoe" or as a "[martial arts](martial_arts "wikilink") slipper", is a
type and style of cloth slip-on shoe that is traditionally made in
China, and was originally worn while practicing [kung
fu](kung_fu "wikilink") and other martial arts, and also while
performing [Tai Chi](Tai_Chi "wikilink").

[1] Variants of this shoe are now mass-produced for general-purpose
wear, and there are several slightly different styles. These shoes are
inexpensive and are available worldwide.

One common kind is cheaply produced and is typically black, with minimal
lining; it has a low-sided cloth upper, and a pale brown hard plastic
sole. One variant is made as a lace-up shoe rather than a slip-on shoe.
A version of the shoe for girls and women has a buckle strap and
resembles the [Mary Jane](Mary_Jane_(shoe) "wikilink") shoe. Some
varieties of the kung fu shoe have reinforced cotton soles instead of
plastic ones, and some have rubber soles.

## Military use

Kung fu shoes were used by the low-ranking troops of the [National
Revolutionary Army](National_Revolutionary_Army "wikilink") during the
[Northern Expedition](Northern_Expedition "wikilink") and [Encirclement
Campaigns](Encirclement_Campaigns "wikilink"). Following the [resumed
alliance](Second_United_Front "wikilink") of the
[KMT](Kuomintang "wikilink") and the [Chinese
communists](Communist_Party_of_China "wikilink"), the Kung fu shoes was
widely worn by the troops from autonomous Communist formations (such as
the [New Fourth Army](New_Fourth_Army "wikilink") and the [Eighth Route
Army](Eighth_Route_Army "wikilink")) of NRA. While straw slippers were
issued as a stop-gap especially for new recruits, troops from
[German-trained NRA
Divisions](List_of_German-trained_divisions_of_the_National_Revolutionary_Army "wikilink")
rather used leather shoes while their officers used leather boots.
