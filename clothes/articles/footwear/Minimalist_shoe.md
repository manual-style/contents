**Minimalist shoes** are shoes intended to closely approximate [barefoot
running](barefoot_running "wikilink") or walking conditions in
comparison to traditional shoes.[1][2] They have reduced cushioning,
thin soles, and are of lighter weight than other running shoes, allowing
for more sensory contact for the foot on the ground while simultaneously
providing the feet with some protection from ground hazards and
conditions (such as pebbles and dirt).[3] Research shows that wearing a
minimalist shoe can help improve foot strength and arch function.[4]

## Types

Generally, there are two types of minimalist shoes:[5]

-   *Barefoot Running Shoes* are characterized by their zero drop from
    heel to toe, no arch support, minimal cushioning at the heel, and a
    very thin sole of around 3-10mm. Also, the [toe
    box](toe_box "wikilink") is considerably wider to provide more space
    to the toes, whereby they slightly resemble the shape of ducks feet,
    when viewed from above and compared to traditional shoes. Few
    product lines fall into this category. Examples include the [Vibram
    FiveFingers](Vibram_FiveFingers "wikilink") and
    [Merrell](Merrell_(company) "wikilink") Glove, which use an outsole
    produced by [Vibram](Vibram "wikilink"), or the
    [Xero](Xero_Shoes "wikilink") Prio.
-   *Minimalist Running Shoes* are in between traditional running shoes
    and barefoot running shoes. They have a reduced heel-to-toe drop of
    about 4–8 mm, reduced cushioning and reduced or no arch support. The
    toe box is usually in-between barefoot and traditional running
    shoes.

In recognition of the barefoot running movement, major companies also
started producing shoes targeted at this customer segment. However,
these shoes do not usually meet the requirement of a minimal or barefoot
shoe. Examples include:

-   The [Nike Free](Nike_Free "wikilink"), which has a 17 mm heel and is
    marketed as minimalist running shoe, though this designation is
    disputed by some.[6]
-   The Adidas Adizero line, which has a heel-to-toe drop of 4 to 10mm,
    a total heel height of up to 30mm and a comparatively traditional,
    narrow toe box.
-   The [Champion](Champion_(sportswear) "wikilink") Alpha.

In contrast to *barefoot* and *minimal* shoes, one of the marketing
terms repeatedly employed for this product segment is *natural running*.
