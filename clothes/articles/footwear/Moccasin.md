![](Soft_moccasin.jpg "fig:Soft_moccasin.jpg") A **moccasin** is a
[shoe](shoe "wikilink"), made of [deerskin](deer "wikilink") or other
soft leather,[1] consisting of a sole (made with leather that has not
been "worked") and sides made of one piece of leather,[2] stitched
together at the top, and sometimes with a vamp (additional panel of
leather). The sole is soft and flexible and the upper part often is
adorned with embroidery or beading.[3] Though sometimes worn inside, it
is chiefly intended for outdoor use. Historically, it is the footwear of
many indigenous people of [North
America](North_American_Indians "wikilink"); moreover, hunters, traders,
and European settlers wore them.[4] Etymologically, the *moccasin*
derives from the [Algonquian language](Algonquian_languages "wikilink")
[Powhatan](Powhatan_language "wikilink") word *makasin* (cognate to
[Massachusett](Massachusett_language "wikilink") *mohkisson* /
*mokussin*, [Ojibwa](Anishinaabe_language "wikilink") *makizin*,
[Mi'kmaq](Mi'kmaq_language "wikilink") *mksɨn*),[5][6] and from the
[Proto-Algonquian](Proto-Algonquian "wikilink") word \**maxkeseni*
(shoe).[7]

In the 1800s, moccasins usually were part of a Canadian regalia, e.g. a
[powwow](powwow "wikilink") suit of clothes. The most common style is
that of the [Plains Indians](Plains_Indians "wikilink") moccasin.

Moccasins protect the foot while allowing the wearer to feel the ground.
The [Plains Indians](Plains_Indians "wikilink") wore hard-sole
moccasins, given that their territorial geography featured rock and
cacti. The eastern Indian tribes wore soft-sole moccasins, for walking
in leaf-covered forest ground.

## Contemporary use

In [New Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink") and
[Australia](Australia "wikilink"), [sheep
shearers](sheep_shearer "wikilink")' moccasins are constructed of a
synthetic, cream-colored [felt](felt "wikilink"), with a back seam and
gathered at the top of the rounded toe. These moccasins are laced in the
front, and the lacing is covered with a flap fastened with a
[buckle](buckle "wikilink") at the shoe's outer side. The fastener
arrangement prevents the shearer's handpiece comb from catching in the
laces.[8] Shearers' moccasins protect the feet, grip wooden floors well,
and absorb sweat.[9]

The word *moccasin* can also denote a shoe of deer
[leather](leather "wikilink") adorned with laces.

### Driving moccasins

A *driving moccasin* (driving moc) is a contemporary version of the
traditional Native American moccasin with the addition of rubber tabs on
the sole. The addition of rubber-pad sole adds to the versatility and
longevity of the shoe while maintaining the flexibility and comfort of a
traditional moccasin. They were invented for men who wanted extra grip
while driving.[10] There are two variations of the sole including:

-   *Rubber-dotted* - These have a uniform covering of small, round
    rubber pads.
-   *Separated Pad* - These have larger, flat rubber pads separated by
    only small areas.

### Work boot moccasins

Moc Toe Boots, commonly referred as a "Moc Toe", the boots are normally
combined with hard rubber compounded soles. The moccasin toe [work
boot](Work_boots "wikilink") is a style that reflects the Native
American moccasin. Normally by weld stitching two pieces of leather or
fabric, the pattern creates a U-shaped design around the [toe
box](toe_box "wikilink").
