A **monk strap** (or **monk shoe**) is a style of [dress
shoes](Dress_shoe "wikilink") with no lacing, instead secured on the
feet by one or mutiple buckles and straps. It is a moderately formal
shoe: less formal than a full [Oxford](Oxford_shoe "wikilink")
(American: Balmoral); but more so than an open
[Derby](Derby_shoe "wikilink") (American: Blücher).[1] In between these,
it is one of the main categories of men's shoes.

It often has a cap toe, is occasionally [brogued](Brogues "wikilink"),
and is popular in [suede](suede "wikilink").
