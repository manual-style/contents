**Moon Boot** is a [snow boot](snow_boot "wikilink") brand first created
as [après-ski](après-ski "wikilink") wear in the early 1970s by
manufacturer [Tecnica Group](Tecnica_Group "wikilink") of [Giavera del
Montello](Giavera_del_Montello "wikilink") in
[Italy](Italy "wikilink").[1] They became a popular
[fad](fad "wikilink") in the years following the [Apollo
11](Apollo_11 "wikilink") moon landing, and resurfaced as a
[retrofuturistic](retrofuturistic "wikilink") fashion trend in the early
2000s.[2][3] They received additional exposure through the
[nerdy](nerdy "wikilink") protagonist of the 2004 film *[Napoleon
Dynamite](Napoleon_Dynamite "wikilink")*.[4][5] Starting in 2011 they
have been produced in Ukraine, at the rate of some 700,000 per year.[6]

The boot is constructed with a thin rubber outsole and cellular rubber
midsole covered by [nylon](nylon "wikilink") fabrics and using
[polyurethane](polyurethane "wikilink") foams. Company founder Giancarlo
Zanatta, after watching the lunar landing and being inspired by the
shape and technology of the astronauts' boots, drew sketches and then
began to design and develop the original Moon Boot. Tecnica registered
worldwide the trademark Moon Boot name in 1978.
