**Mukluks**[1] or **Kamik** ([Inuktitut](Inuktitut "wikilink"):
[ᑲᒥᒃ](Inuktitut_syllabics "wikilink") [2]) (singular: ᑲᒪᒃ *kamak*,
plural: ᑲᒦᑦ *kamiit*) are a soft [boot](boot "wikilink"), traditionally
made of [reindeer](reindeer "wikilink") ([caribou](caribou "wikilink"))
skin or [sealskin](Pinniped "wikilink"), and worn by
[Arctic](Arctic "wikilink") aboriginal people, including the
[Inuit](Inuit "wikilink"), [Iñupiat](Iñupiat "wikilink"), and
[Yupik](Yupik_peoples "wikilink")[3].

Mukluks may be worn over an inner boot liner and under a protective
overshoe.[4][5] The term *mukluk* is often used for any soft boot
designed for cold weather, and modern designs may use both traditional
and modern materials.[6] The word "mukluk" is of
[Iñupiat](Iñupiat "wikilink") and [Yupik](Yupik_peoples "wikilink")
origin, from *maklak*, the [bearded seal](bearded_seal "wikilink"),
while "kamik" is an Inuit word. In the Inuipiaq language the "u" makes
an "oo" sound, and so the spelling "maklak" is used with the same
pronunciation.

## Related boots

Another type of boot, sometimes called an **Inuit boot**, originating in
[Greenland](Greenland "wikilink") and the eastern part of
[Alaska](Alaska "wikilink"), is made by binding it with animal
cartilage, and has a centre seam running down to the foot of the boot.

Another type has a soft leather sole, but the upper is knitted out of
wool or a wool-rayon blend. Often called "Slipper Socks", these are
traditionally worn by the people of the [Hindu
Kush](Hindu_Kush "wikilink") Mountains.

In the early 1990s, Métis entrepreneur Sean McCormick went into the
mukluk business and launched Manitobah Mukluks.[7] The shoes were based
on traditional Métis footwear with a city-friendly rubber sole and the
brand quickly became the fastest-growing footwear line in Canada.[8] In
2006 many celebrities were seen wearing the footwear which created
demand for them worldwide.[9] In 2012 [Adam
Azimov](Adam_Azimov "wikilink") produced a video documenting efforts to
interest fashion leaders in wearing mukluks.[10][11]

## Function

As mukluks are soft-soled, and flex [with the
feet](Anatomical_terms_of_motion#Hands_and_feet "wikilink"), they allow
hunters to move very quietly. A wearer can run, tip-toe, and even dance
in mukluks. They are also designed for use in the tundra.[12]

Mukluks weigh little. While, for instance, U.S. Marine
extreme-cold-weather boots weigh eight pounds (4kg), soft-soled boots
made using modern materials weigh less than a tenth of that.[13][14]
Because mukluks weigh little, there is no need for heavy lacing;
[friction](friction "wikilink") is enough to hold them on the foot. Some
mukluks are very lightly laced (through external loops sewn into the
seams, so as not to leak). They may be laced over the arch of the foot,
or around the top of the boot to stiffen it.[15] Many, however, have no
lacing to constrict the [circulation](Circulatory_system "wikilink") and
make the foot cold. The top of the boot stands up somewhat stiffly, and
may be open at the top, which allows moisture to escape.

The design of the mukluk is used for the industrial manufacture of
cold-weather boots, especially paired with a rugged contemporary sole.
The key component of its success is its ability to breathe, that is, to
allow air exchange. This is an advantage in extremely cold conditions
where perspiration may become a factor in frostbite on one's feet. The
bulkiness paired with their poor performance in slush makes them less
ideal for the casual winter wearer.[16]

## Manufacture

![](Eskimos_drilling_ivory_and_making_mukluks,_Port_Clarence,_Alaska,_ca_1900_(HEGG_337).jpeg "fig:Eskimos_drilling_ivory_and_making_mukluks,_Port_Clarence,_Alaska,_ca_1900_(HEGG_337).jpeg")
Mukluks are often made with a wrapped sole, so that the seam around the
sole is on the top and sides of the boot, not on the bottom edge. This
helps avoid wear on the seams and leaks.

Kamiks made for cold, dry winter weather may have fur low down on the
outside, and other features that would be a problem when not on dry,
powdery snow. Kamiks for warm, slushy, muddy, or open-ocean conditions
are stitched finely from waterproof sealskin (see illustration, top
left)[17]. [Blind-stitching](Blind_stitch "wikilink") (not piercing the
full depth of the skin) with sinew, which shrinks when wet, helps keep
mukluks watertight.[18][19] Commercial boots of modern materials will
often require seam-sealing after purchase if they are to be fully
waterproof.

Usually, the uppers of summer kamik are made [ringed
seal](ringed_seal "wikilink") skin, while the soles are made of [bearded
seal](bearded_seal "wikilink"), which is tougher. The skin requires
laborious preparation.[20] Winter kamik are often made of caribou leg
fur; caribou, unlike seals, rely on fur rather than blubber for
insulation, so their fur is warmer.[21][22]

The short overshoes may also be made waterproof for wet conditions[23]
or furry and grippy for dry ones.[24][25]

For insulation, mukluks may be lined with furs such as
[caribou](caribou "wikilink"), [rabbit](rabbit "wikilink"),
[fox](fox "wikilink") and [raccoon](raccoon "wikilink"). Down,
polyester, and closed-celled [EVA foam](EVA_foam "wikilink") is also
used in soft-soled boots.[26] The inner boot is often made with the fur
facing inwards.[27] It may also be made of textile.

Mukluks may be adorned with [pompons](pompon "wikilink"),
[beads](bead "wikilink"), embroidery, and other methods.

After a year's storage, traditional skin kamiks tend to stiffen and need
to be worked and stretched to make them pliable again.[28]
