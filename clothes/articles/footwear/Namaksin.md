**Namaksin** is a kind of traditional [Korean](Korea "wikilink")
[clog](clog_(shoe) "wikilink") made of wood for protection against
[mud](mud "wikilink") and [rain](rain "wikilink"). Namaksin are known as
close-toed shoes made of one piece of wood. There was a misconception
that these traditional clogs came not from Asia but from the
[Netherlands](Netherlands "wikilink") in the past, but in reality, there
had been clogs at least from [Three Kingdoms period of
Korea](Three_Kingdoms_period_of_Korea "wikilink"), which were similar to
[geta](geta_(footwear) "wikilink"), Japanese clogs. Those old namaksin
were called "pyeonggeuk (平屐)". It is presumed that clogs of
[Baekje](Baekje "wikilink") went to Japan, and it became the origin of
geta. Clogs in Baekje had three holes like geta, but clogs in
[Silla](Silla "wikilink") had five holes. How people tied its strings in
that era is unclear. In the Three Kingdoms period, there were two types
of clogs: open-toes shoes, and close-toes shoes. As time went by, the
latter became primary as namaksin. These shoes were worn by Koreans of
all ages and [social](social "wikilink") positions, usually in the rainy
seasons.
