The **New Balance 99X Series** is a series of [athletic
shoes](athletic_shoes "wikilink") produced by [New
Balance](New_Balance "wikilink") since the introduction of the first New
Balance 990 in 1982.

The shoes have been updated sporadically since the original 990 — all
models have used the 99X numbering format and some model numbers have
been reused throughout the years.

On the 30th anniversary of the shoe in 2012, the New York Times
reported, "The 990 has a cult following: according to New Balance
officials, it was favored by [Steve Jobs](Steve_Jobs "wikilink"), and
has also been worn by the actors [Ben Affleck](Ben_Affleck "wikilink"),
[Jennifer Garner](Jennifer_Garner "wikilink") and [Hilary
Duff](Hilary_Duff "wikilink").[1] Forbes, BBC and other media also
reported how Jobs wore the shoes frequently. [2][3][4]

Design of the 990 in 2012 was led by New Balance Senior Designer Andrew
Nyssen.[5]

## Series history

Most of the information on the early models of the 99X Series is
available on two New Balance promotional histories of the series in
video format.[6][7]

New Balance chairman Jim Davis has claimed that the original design
concept actually came in a letter from Steve Jobs, a known New Balance
enthusiast and founder of Apple Computers. Jobs, wrote to Davies because
he was tired of wearing plain leather shoes and he wanted something
"more sporty and hip". He included a rough sketch of what he envisioned
for the shoe and this formed the base that designers built the series
from.

(just asked Jim Davis face to face in November 2018 in Shanghai, China,
that he denied the design story above, saying "We gave him (Steve Jobs)
two, but he just kept buying and buying.)
