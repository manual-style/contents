## History

Nocona Boots was founded in [Nocona, Texas](Nocona,_Texas "wikilink") in
1925 by Enid Justin. She was the daughter of [Justin
Boots](Justin_Boots "wikilink") founder [H.J. "Daddy Joe"
Justin](Herman_Joseph_Justin "wikilink"), who had begun boot-making in
[Spanish Fort, Texas](Spanish_Fort,_Texas "wikilink") in 1879.
[Cowboys](Cowboy "wikilink") ordered his custom-fit boots, which were
ready to pick up after their [cattle
drives](cattle_drive "wikilink").[2] In 1887, the
[railroad](railroad "wikilink") came through Nocona, and the boot
factory moved there to take advantage of better shipping.

Enid started working in her father's shop at the age of 12 in 1906,
where she remained for the next 12 years.[3] After he died in 1918,
other members of the family wanted to move the business to [Ft.
Worth](Fort_Worth,_Texas "wikilink"). Enid felt so strongly her father
wanted the company based in Nocona, she stayed behind when her brothers
moved the factory's equipment to Ft. Worth in 1925.[4] She borrowed
$5,000 and kept seven employees to found the Nocona Boots brand.

The discovery of [oil](oil "wikilink") near Nocona brought many new
customers. Nocona made a 16-inch lace-up boot tough enough to survive
the oil fields, bringing the wildcatters back for more.[5]

In 1981, Nocona Boots merged with Justin Industries, the then parent
company of [Justin Boots](Justin_Boots "wikilink"), bringing the two
boot-making companies full circle. In 1999, the Nocona plant was shut
down and production moved to El Paso, Texas.[6]

## Today

Today, Nocona Boots still handcrafts premium [cowboy
boots](cowboy_boots "wikilink") offering collections in the Fashion,
Legacy, Exotic, Western, Rancher and Competitor categories. The brand
was also the first to offer cowboy boots officially licensed by The
Collegiate Licensing Company, the [College](College "wikilink") Boots
Collection, handcrafted in the U.S.A.[7] Nocona Boots footwear is
available for men, women and children at western specialty stores across
the country and online footwear retailers, including Zappos.

In November 2016, the city of Nocona learned that it would receive a
$500,000 Community Development Block Grant from the Texas Department of
Agriculture to help with costs to turn the original Justin Leather Goods
building located at 100 Clay St. into a community activity center and
farmers market.[8]
