![](Okobo.JPG "fig:Okobo.JPG") in Kyoto wearing Okobo\]\] , also
referred to as *pokkuri*, *bokkuri*, or *koppori geta* from the sound
made when walking,[1] are wooden sandals worn by
*[maiko](Maiko_(geiko) "wikilink")* (apprentice
*[geisha](geisha "wikilink")*) during their apprenticeship. Shorter
*okobo* are also worn by young women to formal occasions such as
[*Seijin no Hi*](Coming_of_Age_Day "wikilink"); these are often finished
with black lacquer and may be decorated with designs of things like
flowers on the side.

The okobo worn by maiko are usually five to six inches tall (13 to
15 cm).[2] They are usually made from willow, and have no finish or a
natural finish. During the summer months, maiko wear black-lacquered
okobo. They are held to the foot by simple thong-like straps in colors
that represent their maiko status. Red straps are worn by new maiko,
while yellow ones are worn by those who have nearly completed their
apprenticeship. Okobo are worn to prevent the wearer's kimono from
touching the ground.[3]
