![](Traditional_shoes.jpg "fig:Traditional_shoes.jpg") **Opanci** are
traditional peasant shoes worn in [Southeastern
Europe](Southeastern_Europe "wikilink") (specifically [Bosnia and
Herzegovina](Bosnia_and_Herzegovina "wikilink"),
[Bulgaria](Bulgaria "wikilink"), [Croatia](Croatia "wikilink"),
[Macedonia](Republic_of_Macedonia "wikilink"),
[Serbia](Serbia "wikilink"), and also [Romania](Romania "wikilink") and
[Albania](Albania "wikilink")). The attributes of the **Opanci** (name
in plural) are: a construction of [leather](leather "wikilink"), lack of
laces, durable, and various ending on toes. In Serbia, the design of the
horn-like ending on toes indicates the region of origin. The Opanci are
considered a [national symbol of
Serbia](National_symbols_of_Serbia "wikilink"), and the traditional
peasant footwear for people in the Balkan region.

## Etymology

[Serbo-Croatian](Serbo-Croatian "wikilink") òpanak/о̀панак, as well as
Bulgarian and Macedonian opinok/опинок, ultimately derive from
[Proto-Slavic](Proto-Slavic "wikilink") word \*opьnъkъ.[1] Proto-Slavic
\*opьnъkъ is composed from the following parts:[2]

-   the preposition/prefix \*o(b)- "around, on, etc." with final \*b
    [assimilated](assimilation_(linguistics) "wikilink") and the
    resulting geminated consonant cluster \*pp simplified to \*p
-   \*-pьn-, yielding Serbo-Croatian *-pan-* with
    [strong](Havlik's_law "wikilink") *[jer](Yers "wikilink")* \*ь
    vocalized to /a/. \*pьn- is the [ablaut](ablaut "wikilink") form of
    the root of the verb \*pęti (from earlier \*pen-ti), originally
    meaning "to extend, stretch, strain" (cf. modern standard
    Serbo-Croatian verbs conveying the same notion such as
    nàpēti/на̀пе̄ти, pròpēti/про̀пе̄ти, ràspēti/ра̀спе̄ти, pòpēti/по̀пе̄ти..),
    but subsequently coming to mean "to climb" (whence the meaning of
    modern standard Serbo-Croatian pȇti/пе̑ти, pènjati/пѐњати).
-   \*-ъkъ, a Slavic suffix

So literally, *òpanak* would roughly mean "climbing footwear"[3] or
"footwear made from stretched (animal hide)".

## History

Archeologists found footprints of leather shoes worn by Geto-Dacians
dating to 2500 BC. [Trajan's Column](Trajan's_Column "wikilink") in Rome
features Dacians wearing this type of leather shoes. Archeological
findings show that the local population was hunting wild game: foxes,
deer, badgers, wolves, bears, whose skins were later manufactured. The
nobility would wear game skin shoes, the poorer ones would wear calf or
swine skin.[4] In the past the traditional shoes were handcrafted out of
leather processed at home. The piece of leather had to be larger than
the sole, with holes on the side so that a thin string of leather can be
filled in and it wraps the piece of leather around the foot, giving it
the form of some footwear. The puckered form gave it a sharp tip. They
would be worn over wool stockings or white pieces of clothing. Nowadays
they are often used as part of the traditional costume by folk dance
groups and folk artists.[5]

![`Opinca_Dacica_Muzeul_capitolini_1.JPG`](Opinca_Dacica_Muzeul_capitolini_1.JPG "Opinca_Dacica_Muzeul_capitolini_1.JPG")

Until 50 years ago, they were usually worn in rural areas of [Bosnia and
Herzegovina](Bosnia_and_Herzegovina "wikilink"),
[Bulgaria](Bulgaria "wikilink"), [Croatia](Croatia "wikilink"),
[Macedonia](Republic_of_Macedonia "wikilink"),
[Romania](Romania "wikilink") and [Serbia](Serbia "wikilink").[6]
Nowadays, they are only used in folk costume, for folkloric dance
ensembles, festivals, feast days or other cultural events.

The largest Opanak in the world, in the Guinness World Book since 2006,
is the 3.2m shoe, size 450, weighing 222 kg, made by *opančar* Slavko
Strugarević, from [Vrnjačka Banja](Vrnjačka_Banja "wikilink"),
[Serbia](Serbia "wikilink").[7]
