**Opinga** ([Gheg Albanian](Gheg_Albanian "wikilink"): Apânga) are
traditional [shoes](shoes "wikilink") worn by
[Albanians](Albanians "wikilink") in [Albania](Albania "wikilink"),
[Kosovo](Kosovo "wikilink"), [North
Macedonia](North_Macedonia "wikilink"),
[Montenegro](Montenegro "wikilink"), [Greece](Greece "wikilink") (by the
[Arvanites](Arvanites "wikilink")) and the
[Arbëresh](Arbëresh "wikilink") villages of
[Italy](Italy "wikilink").[1] It was also worn by countrymen in
[Romania](Romania "wikilink") (opinca), [Serbia](Serbia "wikilink"),
[Croatia](Croatia "wikilink"), [Bosnia and
Herzegovina](Bosnia_and_Herzegovina "wikilink") (opanak),
[Bulgaria](Bulgaria "wikilink") (opinka) and other countries. They are
made of one [leather](leather "wikilink") skin, formed to the feet with
leather or wool strips. A southern Albanian variety of opinga are the
typical turned up leather shoes with red and black wool pompoms on the
ends, which are often used for [folk
dances](list_of_Albanian_dances "wikilink").[2]

## History

![](Albanian_fustanella_-_1850_-_1900.jpg "fig:Albanian_fustanella_-_1850_-_1900.jpg")
The earliest archaeological evidence for opinga dates back to the 5-4th
centuries BC, indicating they were an element in
[Illyrian](Illyrians "wikilink") culture.[3][4] Later evidence of their
use in Albania, comes from works of 16th century iconographic painter
[Onufri](Onufri "wikilink").[5]

It has been suggested that the etymology of the word comes from
[Proto-Albanian](Proto-Albanian_language "wikilink")
*[\*api](wikt:*api "wikilink")* (modern )*,* meaning "step".[6]

In 1610 [Marino Bizzi](Marino_Bizzi "wikilink"), a Venetian patrician in
Dalmatia and [Archbishop of
Antivari](Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Bar "wikilink"), notes that the
men of [Mirdita](Mirdita "wikilink") wore opinga, made of cow skin,
prepared by the men themselves.[7]

The artisans of the [kaza](Sanjak_of_Delvina "wikilink") of
[Përmet](Përmet "wikilink") held the monopoly in the trade of opinga in
the vilayets of [Shkodër](Scutari_Vilayet "wikilink") and
[Janina](Janina_Vilayet "wikilink") until 1841, when that privilege was
revoked under the [Tanzimat reforms](Tanzimat_reforms "wikilink").[8]
