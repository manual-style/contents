**Organ shoes** are [shoes](shoe "wikilink") worn by
[organists](organist "wikilink"), designed to facilitate playing of the
[organ](organ_(music) "wikilink") pedal keyboard. Also, since organ
shoes are worn only at the organ, the use of special footwear avoids
picking up grit or grime that could scar or stain the
[pedal](pedal_keyboard "wikilink") keys.[1] Shoes are not always used;
some famous organists like [Rhoda Scott](Rhoda_Scott "wikilink") play
with bare feet.

## Description

Organ shoes are typically as narrow as comfortably possible, so as to
prevent accidental playing of more than one pedal key at a time.[2] They
usually have both leather [soles](Sole_(shoe) "wikilink") and leather
[heels](heel_(shoe) "wikilink") that are glued into place (rather than
stitched), which allow the organist to slide the feet along and across
the pedals easily. The soles should be thin enough to feel the pedal key
surfaces reasonably easily, but sufficiently stiff for solid and secure
playing contact with the pedal keys.[3] Organ shoes typically have a
slightly higher heel of about one inch - to ease playing with the heel,
and to allow non-adjacent notes to be played at once by one foot.[4]
