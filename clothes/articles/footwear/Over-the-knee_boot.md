**Over-the-knee boots** (or cuissardes, which include
[thighboots](thighboots "wikilink"), top boots, hip-boots, and waders),
*OTK boots*, are long boots that fully or partly cover the knee.
Originally created as a man's riding boot in the 15th century, in the
latter part of the 20th century, the style was redefined as a [fashion
boot](fashion_boot "wikilink") for women. Over-the-knee boots are also
used as a work boot in circumstances requiring additional protection for
the legs (e.g. [fishing waders](Waders_(footwear) "wikilink")).

## As men's footwear

Over-the-knee boots first became popular as [riding
boots](riding_boots "wikilink") for men in the 15th century, when the
growing popularity of doublet and lightweight hose meant that extra
protection was required for the legs when on horseback. This was also
linked to the decline in the use of full plate armour as the use of
firearms became more widespread in warfare. Heavy cavalry in the 16th
and 17th centuries had only limited armour, in the form of a helmet and
breastplate, or cuirass. Thigh-length boots in heavy leather provided
additional protection for the legs. Today, many cavalry regiments still
retain these high boots for ceremonial dress.[1]

Riding boots of this style were widespread in the 17th and 18th century,
and remained in common use through to the late 19th century. They are
the likely source of the term
*[bootlegging](wikt:bootlegging "wikilink")*, which originally came from
the practice of concealing hip flasks of alcohol in the legs of boots.
Because of these historical associations, cuissardes came to convey an
image of potent masculinity, conjuring up images of cavaliers, pirates,
or musketeers.

## As women's footwear

![](WinterWear2011.JPG "fig:WinterWear2011.JPG")s, 2011\]\] The earliest
examples of women wearing over-the-knee boots come from the traditional
[principal boy](principal_boy "wikilink") role in pantomime theater, in
which the young male protagonist of the play is played by a young
actress in boys' clothes. These [breeches
roles](breeches_role "wikilink") were also a rare opportunity for an
early 20th century actress to wear a revealing costume, potentially
increasing the size of the audience.[2] When playing historical
characters such as [Dick Whittington](Richard_Whittington "wikilink"),
the principal boy would often wear over-the-knee boots as part of her
costume,[3] emphasizing her swashbuckling, heroic character.

The adoption of over-the-knee boots as a fashion item for women began in
the early 1960s. In 1962, [Balenciaga](Balenciaga "wikilink")'s fall
collection featured a tall boot by Mancini that just covered the
knee[4][5] and the following year, [Yves Saint
Laurent's](Yves_Saint_Laurent_(designer) "wikilink") couture collection
included thigh-length alligator skin boots by designer [Roger
Vivier](Roger_Vivier "wikilink").[6][7][8] These were based on a design
originally produced by Vivier for the dancer [Rudolf
Nureyev](Rudolf_Nureyev "wikilink") in the ballet [Swan
Lake](Swan_Lake "wikilink"). The adaptation of hyper-masculine boots as
fashion footwear for women has been interpreted as part of a broader
1960s trend against the femininity of Dior's post-war "[New
Look](Christian_Dior_S.A.#The_"New_Look" "wikilink")".[9]

Rising hemlines and the availability of new, brightly colored artificial
materials such as [PVC](PVC "wikilink"),[10] combined to make boots an
attractive fashion option for younger women. As skirts became even
shorter in the late 1960s, there was a resurgence of interest in
[thigh-length boots](thigh-length_boots "wikilink") or
cuissardes.[11][12] [Pierre Cardin](Pierre_Cardin "wikilink") featured
shiny black PVC thighboots as part of his futuristic 1968 couture
collection[13] and Beth Levine designed seamless, stretch vinyl and
nylon stocking boots tall enough to do double duty as
hosiery.[14][15][16] The tallest boots from this period were so high
that they were equipped with suspenders to hold them up.[17][18]

Over the next three decades, the popularity of over-the-knee boots as a
fashion item for women waxed and waned. In the early 1970s, the
multi-colored suede and canvas over-the-knee boots produced by the
London store [Biba](Biba "wikilink")[19] were so sought-after that
queues would form outside the store when a delivery was due.[20] The end
of the decade saw a second-wave of over-the-knee and thigh-length boots;
these were a longer version of the stack-heeled knee-length boots
popular in the late 1970s and were usually worn over jeans.[21][22] In
the late 1980s, over-the-knee boots made a reappearance; these were
loose-fitting, low-heeled styles in suede,[23] often brightly colored or
decorated with brocade.[24] By 1990, [Karl
Lagerfeld](Karl_Lagerfeld "wikilink") had included thigh-length satin
boots in his Fall/Winter Couture collection for
[Chanel](Chanel "wikilink"), using the boots as an alternative to
leggings;[25] there was a brief vogue for thigh-length "riding boots‚Äù in
the early 1990s[26] and over-the-knee styles were intermittently popular
throughout the first decade of the 21st century. In 2009, thigh-length
boots were a subject of major attention by the fashion
press,[27][28][29][30][31][32] receiving guarded approval and a level of
mainstream acceptance that they had never previously achieved; this
trend continued in 2010[33][34][35] and by the following year,
over-the-knee styles had become commonplace.

Thigh-high boots are more flattering on women with longer legs: "The
shorter you are, the less leg there is above the top of the boot, when
wearing footwear that ends above the knee. A very high heel helps to
give the illusion of height, but when there is much more boot visible
than leg; the effect is to optically foreshorten you."[36]

## As work boots

![](Longboots1.jpg "fig:Longboots1.jpg") Hip boots (sometimes
colloquially called "waders"), are a type of boot worn by river
fishermen. Hip boots are typically made out of rubber, and cover the
legs to the tops of the thighs or to the waist. They are designed to
protect the fisherman when wading into deeper waters and keep the feet
and legs warm in autumn and winter. Hip boots are also worn by
ecologists and environmental scientists who do tests in swamps or lakes
to determine the quality of water.

In contrast to hip boots, waders are waterproof boots that extend from
the foot to the chest. Waders are available with boots attached or can
have attached stocking feet (usually made of the wader material), to
wear inside shorter boots. In addition to being used for leisure
purposes, such as angling or waterfowl hunting, industrial, heavy-duty
waders are used as protective clothing in the chemical industry,
agriculture and in the maintenance of water supply, sewerage and other
utilities.
