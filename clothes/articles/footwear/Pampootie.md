**Pampooties** are raw-hide shoes, which were formerly made and worn on
the [Aran Islands](Aran_Islands "wikilink") of [County
Galway](County_Galway "wikilink"), [Ireland](Ireland "wikilink").

## History

They are formed of a single piece of untanned hide folded around the
foot and stitched with twine or a leather strap.[1]

Hide from the buttocks was most often used. The hair was usually left
and this improved the shoe's grip.[2] The raw hide is kept flexible by
use and the constant damp conditions of Western Ireland. However the
shoes are not made to last. They are prone to rot and were usually kept
for as little as a month or less.[3]

Pampooties are similar to the Scottish [cuaran](cuaran "wikilink")
shoes, and are the precursors to
[ghillies](Ghillies_(dance) "wikilink"), Celtic dance shoes. They are
also similar in appearance to American
[moccasins](moccasins "wikilink").[4] Ancient shoes found preserved from
Stone Age Europe have a similar design.[5]
