![](Logo-Pataugas.jpg "fig:Logo-Pataugas.jpg") **Pataugas**
([French](French_language "wikilink"): splasher) is both a shoe and a
brand created on 24 August 1950 by René Elissabid, an industrialist from
[Mauleon](Mauléon-Licharre "wikilink"), a village in the province of
[Soule](Soule "wikilink"), [France](France "wikilink").[1]

The shoe is more a boot, with a rubbered thick lugged
[outsole](Shoe#Shoe_construction "wikilink") obtained with pulp rubber
heated with a gas stove, hence the name "pataugas."

It was the preferred shoe of generations of [scouts](scouts "wikilink"),
[soldiers](soldiers "wikilink") and [hikers](hikers "wikilink") of all
kinds, including earth tones of the various models are a sign of
authenticity.[2]

The Pataugas brand is owned today by Hopps Group.[3] The acquisition of
Pataugas was a milestone in the strategy of the manufacturer, since
Pataugas is once more fashionable and manages to attract a wider
audience.

The French Shoe company [Palladium](Palladium_Boots "wikilink") makes a
similar shoe/boot[4]
