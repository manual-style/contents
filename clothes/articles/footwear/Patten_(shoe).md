**Pattens** are protective overshoes that were worn in Europe from the
[Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink") until the early 20th century.
Pattens were worn outdoors over a normal shoe, had a wooden or later
wood and metal [sole](Sole_(shoe) "wikilink"), and were held in place by
[leather](leather "wikilink") or [cloth](cloth "wikilink") bands.
Pattens functioned to elevate the foot above the [mud](mud "wikilink")
and dirt (including human [effluent](effluent "wikilink") and animal
[dung](Feces "wikilink")) of the street, in a period when
[road](road "wikilink") and [urban](City "wikilink") paving was minimal.

## Etymology

The word *patten* probably derives from the [Old
French](Old_French "wikilink") *patte* meaning hoof or paw.[1]

Women continued to wear pattens in muddy conditions until the nineteenth
or even early 20th century. In appearance, they may resemble
contemporary [clogs](Clog_(shoe) "wikilink") or
[sandals](Sandal_(footwear) "wikilink"), but though historical usage was
apparently not always consistent, the term now is used only to describe
protective overshoes worn over another pair of shoes.

## Medieval period

Pattens were worn during the [Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink")
outdoors and in public places over (outside) the thin
[soled](Sole_(shoe) "wikilink") [shoes](shoe "wikilink") of that
[era](era "wikilink"). Pattens were worn by both men and women during
the [Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink"), and are especially seen in
art from the [15th century](1400-1500_in_fashion "wikilink"): a time
when [poulaines](poulaine "wikilink"), shoes with very long pointed
toes, were particularly in fashion.
Medieval pattens were known in English by the terms: 'patyns',
'clogges', and 'galoches', but the original shades of meaning and
distinction between these terms is now unclear.[2] Medieval and Early
Modern overshoes are now all usually referred to as 'pattens' for
convenience.

### Types

There were three main types of pattens: one with a wooden 'platform'
sole raised from the ground by either with wooden wedges or iron stands.
The second variant had a flat wooden sole often
[hinged](hinge "wikilink"). The third type had a flat sole made from
stacked layers of [leather](leather "wikilink"). Some later European
varieties of these pattens had a laminated sole: light wooden inner
sections with leather above and below. In earlier varieties of pattens,
dating from the 12th century on, the [stilt](stilts "wikilink") or wedge
variety were more common. From the late 14th century, the flat variety
became increasingly common. Leather pattens became fashionable in the
14th and 15th centuries, and in London appear to have begun to be worn
as shoes over hose in the 15th century, spreading to a much wider
section of the public.[3] Most London patten soles were constructed of
[alder](alder "wikilink"), [willow](willow "wikilink") or
[poplar](Populus "wikilink") [woods](wood "wikilink").[4]
In 1390, the [Diocese of York](Diocese_of_York "wikilink") forbade
[clergy](clergy "wikilink") from wearing pattens and clogs in both
church and in processions, considering them to be indecorous: "*contra
honestatem ecclesiae*".[5] Conversely, the famous Spanish
[rabbi](rabbi "wikilink") [Solomon ben Abraham Ibn
Adret](Shlomo_ben_Aderet "wikilink"), "the Rashba", (c. 1233 – c. 1310)
was asked if it was permissible to wear "patines" on
[Shabbat](Shabbat "wikilink"), to which he replied that it was the
custom of "all the wise in the land" to wear them, and certainly
permitted.[6]
Since shoes of the period had thin soles, pattens were commonly used
mainly because of unpaved roads and also that indoor stone floors were
very cold in winter. Furthermore, [refuse](refuse "wikilink") in cities
– animal especially horse [dung](Feces "wikilink") and human
[effluent](effluent "wikilink") (from [chamber
pots](chamber_pot "wikilink"))– was usually thrown directly into the
street (often with minimal advance warning). Making full foot contact
with such an unpleasant surface was, understandably, highly undesirable.
Thus, pattens tended to only make contact with the ground through two or
three strips of wood and raised the wearer up considerably, sometimes by
four inches (ten centimetres) or more in contrast to
[clogs](clogs "wikilink") which usually have a low, flat-bottomed
[sole](Sole_(shoe) "wikilink") integral to the shoe.

## Early Modern period

![](1773_patten.png "fig:1773_patten.png") A later pattern of patten
which seems to date from the 17th century, and then became the most
common, had a flat metal ring which made contact with the ground,
attached to a metal plate nailed into the wooden sole via connecting
metal, often creating a platform of by several inches (more than 7
centimetres).[7] By this time men's shoes had thicker soles and the
wealthier males (the [gentry](gentry "wikilink") or
[gentlemen](gentlemen "wikilink")) commonly wore high [riding
boots](riding_boot "wikilink"), thus pattens seem only to have been worn
by women and [working-class](working-class "wikilink") men in outdoor
occupations. Since dress [hems](hem "wikilink") extended down to the
feet for most of this period, it was necessary to raise the hem above
the ground to keep the dress clean even in well-swept and paved streets.
The [motto](motto "wikilink") of the London [Worshipful Company of
Pattenmakers](Worshipful_Company_of_Pattenmakers "wikilink"), the former
representative [guild](guild "wikilink") for this trade, was and
remains: *Recipiunt Fœminæ Sustentacula Nobis*, Latin for *Women Receive
Support From Us*. The 19th-century invention of cheap rubber
[galoshes](galosh "wikilink") gradually displaced the patten, as did the
widespread use of [urban](City "wikilink")
[paving](pavement_(architecture) "wikilink"), especially elevated, paved
pathways only for [pedestrians](pedestrian "wikilink")- the now
[ubiquitous](ubiquitous "wikilink") [pavements](Sidewalk "wikilink"),
sidewalk in American English or [hard road
surfaces](Road_surface "wikilink").

### Etiquette and practicality

Wearing of pattens inside church was discouraged, if not outright
forbidden: perhaps because of the noise they made, the oft-commented
"clink" being the consensus term for the sound; [Jane
Austen](Jane_Austen "wikilink") wrote of the "ceaseless clink of
pattens" referring to life in [Bath](Bath,_Somerset "wikilink").[8] To
talk excessively and too loudly was coined to be as if one: "had your
"tongue run (or go) on pattens", used by Shakespeare and others.[9] In
houses, pattens were taken off with hats (for men) and overcoats upon
entering, not doing so being considered rude and inconsiderate by
bringing dirt inside – literally a *faux pas* or wrong step. The aunt of
the [Brontë](Brontë "wikilink") Sisters, Miss Branwell, seems to have
been considered notably eccentric for wearing her pattens indoors:

![](Jean-Étienne_Liotard_007.jpg "fig:Jean-Étienne_Liotard_007.jpg"),
who visited Turkey in 1738\]\]

Pattens were not always easy to walk in, and despite their practical
intention, literary evidence suggests that they could appear, at least
to males, as a further aspect of feminine frailty and dependency.
[Samuel Pepys](Samuel_Pepys "wikilink") recorded in his Diary for
January 24, 1660:

From the *Middle Period* Poems of [John Clare](John_Clare "wikilink")
(1820s):




("hitops" are high boots)

From [Thomas Hardy](Thomas_Hardy "wikilink")'s *[The
Woodlanders](The_Woodlanders "wikilink")* of 1887, though set earlier in
the century:

## Other uses of the term

The word could also be used as a term for a wooden soled shoe, that is a
[chopine](chopine "wikilink") or [clog](clog_(shoe) "wikilink"), as
opposed to an overshoe, until at least the nineteenth century. The word
was also used for the traditional wooden outdoor shoes of
[Japan](Japan "wikilink") and other Asian countries.[10] What are in
effect [snowshoes](snowshoe "wikilink") for mud, as used by
[wildfowlers](wildfowler "wikilink"), boatmen, and [Coast
Guards](Coast_Guard "wikilink") may also be called pattens, or
"mud-pattens". These are shaped boards attached to the sole of a shoe,
which extend sideways well beyond the shape of the foot, and therefore
are a different sort of footwear from the patten discussed here.
"Horse-pattens" were used on horses, especially for
[ploughing](plough "wikilink") muddy fields. The word was also used for
[ice-skates](ice_skating "wikilink"), as it is in French (*patiner*, to
skate).

## The Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers

In [London](London "wikilink"), the [Worshipful Company of
Pattenmakers](Worshipful_Company_of_Pattenmakers "wikilink") remains the
[Livery Company](Livery_Company "wikilink"), formerly
[guild](guild "wikilink") of the Patten-makers, or Patteners, and their
adopted church remains [St Margaret
Pattens](St_Margaret_Pattens "wikilink"). The first record of the guild
dates to 1379, and there was still a pattenmaker listed in a London
Trade Directory in the 1920s. A notice, probably 18th century, in the
Guild Church still requests ladies to remove their pattens on entering;
other English churches have similar signs, and in one case, a board with
pegs for ladies to hang them on.
