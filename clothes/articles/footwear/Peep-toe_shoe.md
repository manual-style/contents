A **peep-toe shoe** is a woman's shoe (usually a
[pump](Court_shoe "wikilink"), [slingback](slingback "wikilink"),
bootie, or any other dress shoe) in which there is an opening at the
[toe-box](toe-box "wikilink") which allows the toes to show.

Peep-toe shoes were popular beginning in the 1940s[1][2] but disappeared
by the 1960s.[3] Peep-toe shoes had a brief resurgence in the 1970s/80s,
before falling out of fashion by the mid-1990s. More recently, they have
become popular again, with variations such as "peep-toe boots"
appearing.[4][5]
