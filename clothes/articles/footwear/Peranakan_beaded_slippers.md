**Peranakan beaded slippers**, also known as **kasut manek**,[1]
literally meaning ***beaded shoes***, is a type of
[shoe](shoe "wikilink") that dates back to the early twentieth century.
It refers to beaded [slippers](slippers "wikilink") worn by a
[nyonya](nyonya "wikilink") to complete her [Sarong
Kebaya](Sarong_Kebaya "wikilink") outfit, together with chained
[brooches](brooch "wikilink") (kerosang) and a silver belt (tali
pendeng). The slippers are made of [Peranakan cut
beads](Peranakan_cut_beads "wikilink") (manek potong), which are
treasured as these beads are no longer available. Vintage kasut manek
are intricate and finely stitched, a testimony to the fine workmanship
of yesteryears. The intricacy and fine workmanship of a pair of beaded
slipper is also a hallmark of highly accomplished
[Peranakan](Peranakan "wikilink") women, also known as nyonyas, whose
skills in [embroidery](embroidery "wikilink") and
[beadwork](beadwork "wikilink") are highly valued.[2]

## Description

the beaded slippers were worn by both the Peranakan males
([baba](Peranakan "wikilink"))[3] and females
([nyonya](nyonya "wikilink")) and were popular in the 1930s. Nowadays,
the beaded slippers are more commonly worn by women only. The beaded
slippers were made for two types of occasions. For happy occasions, like
the [Chinese New Year](Chinese_New_Year "wikilink") or birthdays, these
beaded slippers used colorful beads with intricate patterns. For sad
occasions, the beads used were likely to be in black, white or blue
colors (Chinese mourning colors), and the patterns were simple.

The beaded slippers were either opened face
([peep-toe](peep-toe "wikilink")) or covered face. The popular motifs
used for the patterns were flowers, birds, butterflies, and fruits.
These motifs, likely to appeal to the femininity of the Peranakan women,
had both [European](Europe "wikilink") and [Chinese](China "wikilink")
influence. The sample patterns were likely to be
[cross-stitched](cross_stitch "wikilink"), with each stitch representing
a bead. The beads were then used in the actual beading of the slippers.
The Peranakan pattern for the beaded slipper is unique in that even the
background is quite ornate resulting in a colorful patterned mosaic with
a well-defined border.

To sew the pattern, a laced-up wooden frame (pidangan)[4] is used to
provide the right tension for the beading. The beading process starts
from the center of the pattern, moving to the right then left. The main
motif of the pattern is first beaded, followed by the background and
then the border. The border may have a smooth or scallop-edge. When the
beaded pattern is completed, it would be sent to the cobbler to be made
into slippers. Leather is usually the preferred material for the beaded
slippers, and may be either made with low or high heels.
