[shoes](shoe "wikilink"), [boots](boot "wikilink"), or
[sandals](Sandal_(footwear) "wikilink") with an obvious thick sole,
usually in the range of . Platform shoes may also be [high
heels](high_heels "wikilink"), in which case the heel is raised
significantly higher than the [ball of the
foot](ball_of_the_foot "wikilink"). Extreme heights, of both the sole
and heel, can be found in [fetish footwear](fetish_footwear "wikilink")
such as [ballet boots](ballet_boots "wikilink"), where the sole may be
up to high, and the heels up to and more. The sole of a platform shoe
can have a continuous uniform thickness, have a wedge, a separate block
or a [stiletto](stiletto "wikilink") heel. Raising the ankle increases
the risk of a [sprained ankle](sprained_ankle "wikilink").[1]

## History

Platform shoes are known in many cultures. The most famous predecessor
of platform shoes are the Zoccoli in Venice of the 15th century,
designed with the functional goal of avoiding wet feet when the
pavements were flooded. Depending on the current shoe fashion platform
shoes are more or less popular. In the 1970s they were widespread in
both genders in Europe. Today, they are preferred by females.[2]

### Ancient

![](1773_patten.png "fig:1773_patten.png") After their use in [Ancient
Greece](Ancient_Greece "wikilink") for raising the height of important
characters in the Greek theatre and their similar use by high-born
prostitutes or [courtesans](courtesans "wikilink") in London in the
sixteenth century, platform shoes, called
[Pattens](Patten_(shoe) "wikilink"), are thought to have been worn in
Europe in the eighteenth century to avoid the muck of urban streets. Of
the same practical origins are Japanese
*[geta](geta_(footwear) "wikilink")*. There may also be a connection to
the [buskins](buskin "wikilink") of [Ancient
Rome](Ancient_Rome "wikilink"), which frequently had very thick soles to
give added height to the wearer. Another example of a platform shoe that
functioned as protection from dirt and grime is the Okobo- "Okobo"
referring to the sound that the wooden shoe makes when walking. Dating
back to 18th century Japan, the Okobo was worn by maikos, or geishas,
during their apprenticeships. Similar to the Okobo, wooden Kabkabs were
named after the sound they made upon marble flooring. Worn by Lebanese
women between the 14th and 17th centuries, the straps were often made
from velvet, leather, or silk while the wooden stilts were decorated
with silver or pearl. The ancient Indian Paduka, which translates to
footprints of the Gods, was often sported by the upper echelon as a way
to mark their status. The wooden platforms were sometimes carved into
different animal shapes and decorated with ivory and silver.[3] In
[ancient China](ancient_China "wikilink") men wore black boots with very
thick soles made from layers of white cloths. This style of boots are
often worn today on stage for [Peking
opera](Peking_opera "wikilink").[4] During the [Qing
dynasty](Qing_dynasty "wikilink"), aristocratic
[Manchu](Manchu "wikilink") women wore a form of platform shoe with a
separate high heel, a style that was later adopted in Europe during the
1590s.[5]

### Modern

Platform shoes enjoyed some popularity in the United States, Europe and
the UK from the 1930s to the 1950s but not nearly to the extent of their
popularity from the 1960s to the 1980s.

#### 20th century

##### 1930s–1950s

In the early 1930s, Moshe (Morris) Kimel designed the first modern
version of the platform shoe for actress Marlene Dietrich. Kimel, a Jew,
escaped Berlin, Germany, and settled in the United States with his
family in 1939 and opened the Kimel shoe factory in Los Angeles. The
design soon became very popular amongst Beverly Hills elite. In 1938,
The Rainbow was a platform sandal designed by famous shoe designer,
[Salvatore Ferragamo](Salvatore_Ferragamo "wikilink"). “The Rainbow” was
created and was the first instance of the platform shoe returning in
modern days in the West. The platform sandal was designed for [Judy
Garland](Judy_Garland "wikilink"), an American singer, actress, and
[vaudevillian](vaudevillian "wikilink"). This shoe was a tribute to Judy
Garland's signature song “Over the Rainbow” performed in the [Wizard of
Oz](The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film) "wikilink") in 1939. The shoe was a
crafted using uniquely shaped slabs of cork that were covered in suede
to build up the wedge and gold kidskin was used for the straps.[6] His
creation was a result of experimentations with new materials because of
wartime rationing during [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink").
Traditionally heels were built up with leather, but because of the
rationing of leather, he experimented with wood and cork [7] The colors
and design of this shoe still resemble modern shoe standards today.

In the 1940s, platforms were designed with a high arch, but as
exemplified here, they originated with the heel elevated only slightly
above the toes. The platform brings a heavy looking foundation to the
wearer that is in direct polarity to the [stiletto](stiletto "wikilink")
heel. With its reconfiguration of the arch and structure of attenuated
insubstantiality, the high heel suggests the anti-gravitational effect
of the dancer *en pointe*. On the contrary, the platform displays
weightiness more like the flat steps of modern dance.[8]

In the 1950s, platform shoes were not favored in the same way that they
used to be. Fashion returned to the more elegantly shaped shoe.[9]

##### 1960s and 1970s

A resurgence of interest in platform shoes as fashion began as early as
1967 (appearing in both advertisements and articles in 1970 issues of
[*Seventeen* magazine](Seventeen_(American_magazine) "wikilink")), and
continued through to 1979 in Europe and Britain. The fad lasted even
further in the US, lasting until as late as the early 1980s.[10] At the
beginning of the fad, they were worn primarily by young women in their
teens and twenties, and occasionally by younger girls, older women, and
(particularly during the [disco](disco "wikilink") era) by young
men.[11][12] Platform shoes were considered the "party shoe."[13]
Disco-goers used their shoes to bring attention to themselves on the
dance floor.[14] 70s platform shoes were presented in dramatic and showy
ways such as with glitter or tiny lights.[15]

In 1972, at 219 Bowery in Manhattan, Carole Basetta developed a special
mold for making platform shoes and was successful in selling custom-made
shoes to people such as David Bowie, David Johanson of the New York
Dolls, and several other punk artists.[16]

Although platform shoes did provide added height without the discomfort
of spike heels, they seem to have been worn primarily for the sake of
attracting attention. Many [glam rock](glam_rock "wikilink") musicians
wore platform shoes as part of their act. David Bowie, an icon of glam
rock in the 1970s, famously wore platform shoes while performing as his
alter ego Ziggy Stardust. Bowie is regarded as an icon of androgynous
fashion, noted for his queering of gender and performance style.[17][18]

While a wide variety of styles were popular during this period,
including boots, [espadrilles](espadrilles "wikilink"),
[oxfords](oxford_shoe "wikilink"),
[sneakers](Sneaker_(footwear) "wikilink"), and
[sandals](Sandal_(footwear) "wikilink") of all description, with soles
made of wood, [cork](cork_(material) "wikilink"), or synthetic
materials, the most popular style of the late 1960s and early 1970s was
a simple quarter-strap sandal with tan [water
buffalo](domestic_buffalo "wikilink")-hide straps, on a beige
suede-wrapped cork wedge-heel platform sole. These were originally
introduced under the brand name Kork-Ease but the extreme popularity
supported many imitators. Remarkably, there was very little variation in
style, and most of that variation was limited to differences in height.

##### 1980s

As the fad progressed, manufacturers like Candie's stretched the
envelope of what was considered too outrageous to wear, while others,
like [Famolare](Famolare "wikilink") and [Cherokee of
California](Cherokee_(disambiguation) "wikilink"), introduced "comfort"
platforms, designed to combine the added height of platforms with the
support and comfort of sneakers, or even orthopedic shoes, and by the
time the fad finally fizzled in the late 1980s, girls and women of all
ages were wearing them. It may also be a by-product of this fad that
[Scandinavian](Scandinavia "wikilink") [clogs](clogs "wikilink"), which
were considered rather outrageous in the late 1960s and early 1970s, had
become classic by the 1980s.

##### 1990s

[Vivienne Westwood](Vivienne_Westwood "wikilink"), the UK fashion
designer, re-introduced the high heeled platform shoe into high fashion
in the early [1990s](1990s_fashion "wikilink"); it was while wearing a
pair of Super-Elevated Gillie with five-inch platforms and nine-inch
heels that the supermodel [Naomi Campbell](Naomi_Campbell "wikilink")
fell on the catwalk at a fashion show[19]. However, they did not catch
on quickly and platform shoes only began to resurface in mainstream
fashion in the late 1990s, thanks in part to the UK band the [Spice
Girls](Spice_Girls "wikilink"). The all-girl group was often seen in
tall platform sneakers and boots. The footwear brand Buffalo created the
famous platform sneakers worn by members of the group.[20]

The United Kingdom (and European) experience of platform shoes was
somewhat different from that of the United States.[21] the long pointed
shoes of the early 2000s, giving an elongated look to the foot, have
been more popular in the US than in the UK.

#### 21st century

##### 2000s

The platform shoe resurfaced in popularity in the early 2000s when the
YSL Tribute Sandal appeared in 2004, quickly gaining popularity by
celebrities and the fashion world for its sex appeal and added comfort
of a platform sole.[22] The shoe is continued to be released season
after season, despite changes in creative directors.[23]

##### 2010s

During the late [2010s](2010s_fashion "wikilink"), platform boots became
fashionable due to a resurgence of interest in [1970s
fashion](1970s_fashion "wikilink"). These included so-called "nothing
shoes" with clear [Perspex](Perspex "wikilink") soles, and [mule
sandals](mule_sandal "wikilink").[24][25]
