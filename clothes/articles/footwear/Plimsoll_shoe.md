A **plimsoll shoe**, **plimsoll**, **plimsole**, **daps** or **pumps**
([British English](British_English "wikilink"); see [other names
below](#Outside_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink")) is a type of [athletic
shoe](athletic_shoe "wikilink") with a canvas upper and rubber
[sole](Shoe#Shoe_construction "wikilink") developed as beachwear in the
1830s by the [Liverpool Rubber Company](Dunlop_Rubber "wikilink").

Plimsolls have solid rubber soles about 8 or 9 mm thick, to which the
canvas is glued without coming up the sides (as on
[trainers](Sneakers "wikilink")). The effect when running is similar to
running without shoes.

The shoe was originally, and often still is in parts of the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink"), called a "sand shoe" and acquired
the nickname "plimsoll" in the 1870s. This name arose, according to
Nicholette Jones's book *The Plimsoll Sensation*, because the coloured
horizontal band joining the upper to the sole resembled the [Plimsoll
line](Waterline "wikilink") on a ship's hull, or because, just like the
Plimsoll line on a ship, if water got above the line of the rubber sole,
the wearer would get wet.[1]

In the UK plimsolls are commonly worn for schools' indoor [physical
education](physical_education "wikilink") lessons. Regional terms are
common: in [Northern Ireland](Northern_Ireland "wikilink") and central
[Scotland](Scotland "wikilink") they are sometimes known as
*[gutties](Gutta-percha "wikilink")*; "sannies" (from 'sand shoe') is
also used in Scotland.[2] In parts of the [West
Country](West_Country "wikilink") and [Wales](South_Wales "wikilink")
they are known as "daps" or "dappers". In London, the [home
counties](home_counties "wikilink"), much of the [West
Midlands](West_Midlands_(region) "wikilink"), the [West Riding of
Yorkshire](West_Riding_of_Yorkshire "wikilink") and north west of
England they are known as "pumps".[3] There is a widespread belief that
"daps" is taken from a factory sign – "Dunlop Athletic Plimsoles" which
was called "the DAP factory". However, this seems unlikely as the first
citation in the *[Oxford English
Dictionary](Oxford_English_Dictionary "wikilink")* of "dap" for a rubber
soled shoe is a March 1924 use in the *[Western Daily
Press](Western_Daily_Press "wikilink")* newspaper; Dunlop did not
acquire the Liverpool Rubber Company (as part of the merger with the
Macintosh group of companies) until 1925. Plimsolls were issued to the
British military (called 'road slappers' by the common soldiery) until
replaced by trainers in the mid-80's. If white they required hours of
application of shoe whitener, if black they were required to be polished
until they gleamed.

As it was commonly used for corporal punishment in the British
Commonwealth, where it was the typical gym shoe (part of the school
uniform), plimsolling is also a synonym for a
[slippering](slippering "wikilink").
