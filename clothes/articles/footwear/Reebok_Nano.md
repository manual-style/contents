## Product history

### Reebok Nano

Reebok became the official provider of licensed CrossFit footwear and
apparel in 2011.[4] That year, Reebok released the first Reebok Nano.
The shoe was designed to be used for high impact movements,
weightlifting and short-distance running.[5] The shoe's design includes
a spacious [toe box](toe_box "wikilink").[6]

### Reebok Nano 2.0

The following year the Nano 2.0 was released.[7] *[Men's
Fitness](Men's_Fitness "wikilink")* included the shoe on its list of
"*Workout Gear for CrossFit: 15 New Products to Improve Your Daily
Workout.*"[8] The shoe has a wider toe box than the first generation to
allow an athlete's foot to splay more naturally and maximize stability.

### Reebok Nano 3.0

The Nano 3.0 was introduced in 2013. The shoe provides forefoot
cushioning and heel stabilization with its dual density platform. The
shoe has a protective layer in its midsole to prevent fraying caused by
rope climbs and features a wide toe box and midsole to provide stability
during lifts.[9] The Nano 3.0 also introduced the DuraCage construction
for additional protection and lightweight support.
