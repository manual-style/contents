A **rigger boot** is a particular type of pull-on [safety
boot](safety_boot "wikilink") in the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink"). The name "rigger" comes from the
fact that they were standard issue for workers on the [offshore oil
rigs](Brent_oilfield "wikilink") in the North Sea, but are nowadays worn
by most types of manual worker as a general purpose workboot.

Riggers, as they are commonly nicknamed, are usually tan in colour and
go approximately third of the way up the leg and feature a
[steel](steel "wikilink") toe cap for safety. Other distinguishing
features of the boots include pull-on loops around the top of the boot's
shaft and internal fur lining.

Many rigger boots are unbranded or generic brands, some of which may
have steel toe caps which may not conform to the EN-345 standard, and
some workplaces concerned about their lack of adequate ankle support now
ban them.[1][2]

The boots are sometimes made in other colours, such as black, where they
can be worn as fashion items in the [punk](Punk_fashion "wikilink") and
[heavy metal](Heavy_metal_music "wikilink") scenes.
