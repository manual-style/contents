**Rocket boots** is an invention by Soviet scientist Viktor Gordeyev.
The invention is a pair of mechanical devices that a user would wear on
his or her lower legs and feet. Rocket Boots are intended to make it
possible for a person to travel faster and further than by unassisted
walking or running.

There are no actual rockets in the Rocket Boots. Rather, the power comes
from pistons that are filled with a fuel-air mixture, and fired by
compression when the user puts his or her full body weight down into the
boot. When the piston fires, the platform under the user's foot pushes
down on the ground, launching the user forward toward the next step in
an action similar to that of [pogo stick](pogo_stick "wikilink"). The
boots use approximately 4 cc fuel per 6.2 miles (10km).

The boots were initially developed in the 1970s for the Soviet Army, but
development was suspended until 2000. The project was restarted in
Russian Federation by scientists at the [Bashkir State
University](Bashkir_State_University "wikilink")
([Ufa](Ufa "wikilink")), with the aim to develop a product for the
civilian and a military markets.

It is expected that while using the "rocket boots", a person could
travel at an average speed of around 10.5 mph (17 km/h). However, it is
thought that the highest speed for an experienced user is around 22 mph
(35km/h).
