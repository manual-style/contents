A **sabot** is a [clog](Clog_(shoe) "wikilink") from
[France](France "wikilink") or surrounding countries such as Belgium or
Italy. Sabots are whole feet clogs.

Sabots were associated with the lower classes in the 16th to 19th
centuries. During this period, the years of the [Industrial
Revolution](Industrial_Revolution "wikilink"), the word
*[sabotage](sabotage#ety "wikilink")* gained currency. Allegedly derived
from *sabot*, sabotage described the actions of disgruntled workers who
willfully damaged workplace machinery by throwing their sabots into the
works. In truth, *sabotage* is derived from a different French word.[1]

45,000 pairs of Sabot were made in [Jersey](Jersey "wikilink") during
the occupation of the island from 1940–45.[2]
