The **saddle shoe**, also known as "saddle oxford", is a low-heeled
casual shoe, characterized by a plain toe and saddle-shaped decorative
panel placed mid foot.[1] Saddle shoes are typically constructed of
[leather](leather "wikilink") and are most frequently white with a black
or dark blue saddle, although any color combination is possible.

Saddle shoes are worn by both men and women in a variety of styles
ranging from golf cleats to school uniform shoes. They have a reputation
as the typical shoes of school-girls, especially in the 1940s.
