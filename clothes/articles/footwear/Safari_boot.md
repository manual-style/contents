**Safari boots** usually have high uppers to provide ankle support much
like [combat boots](combat_boot "wikilink") and typically made from the
likes of leather or canvas and in brown/tan colours suited to the arid
outback environments.

Safari boots were in fashion during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
[Camel Trophy](Camel_Trophy "wikilink") released the range of 'Adventure
Boots' as well as various brands such as Travel Fox who made the 'world
tour boot' with a side pocket.
