**Saltwater sandals** are a popular type of
[footwear](footwear "wikilink") sold mainly in western and southern
markets of the United States. Saltwater sandals are made of specially
treated natural leathers are distinguished by their interlink strap
design with an adjustable buckle strap around the ankle.

## History

Saltwater sandals originated in the early 1940s as an alternative to
traditional children's leather sandals as a way to cope with leather
shortages in [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"). The sandals were
made primarily from scrap leather left over from making men's shoes.

## Manufacturing

The original saltwater sandals were made by the Hoy Shoe Company of [St.
Louis, MO](St._Louis,_MO "wikilink"), the Hoy Shoe Company continues to
produce them.

## Trends

Saltwater sandals have been a summer staple in the children's footwear
category for more than 60 years. More recently, the Hoy Shoe Company
introduced Sun-San Salt-Water Sandals for women. In the November 4, 2007
issue of [New York Magazine](New_York_(magazine) "wikilink"), fashion
editor Sarah Bernard compared saltwater sandals to Crocs and [UGG
boots](UGG_Australia "wikilink") and identified saltwater sandals as the
emerging Ugly Shoe Trend for 2008.[1]
