**Sandals** are an open type of [footwear](footwear "wikilink"),
consisting of a [sole](Sole_(shoe) "wikilink") held to the wearer's
[foot](foot "wikilink") by straps going over the
[instep](instep "wikilink") and, sometimes, around the
[ankle](ankle "wikilink"). Sandals can also have a heel. While the
distinction between sandals and other types of footwear can sometimes be
blurry (as in the case of *[huaraches](Huarache_(shoe) "wikilink")*—the
woven leather footwear seen in Mexico, and peep-toe pumps), the common
understanding is that a sandal leaves all or most of the
[foot](foot "wikilink") exposed. People may choose to wear sandals for
several reasons, among them comfort in warm weather, economy (sandals
tend to require less material than shoes and are usually easier to
construct), and as a [fashion](fashion "wikilink") choice.

Usually, people wear sandals in warmer climates or during warmer parts
of the year in order to keep their feet cool and dry. The risk of
developing [athlete's foot](athlete's_foot "wikilink") is lower than
with enclosed [shoes](shoe "wikilink"), and the wearing of sandals may
be part of the [treatment](Therapy "wikilink") regimen for such an
infection.

## History

![](Sandalias_del_Neolítico_de_Albuñol_(M.A.N._Inv._595_y_596)_01.jpg "fig:Sandalias_del_Neolítico_de_Albuñol_(M.A.N._Inv._595_y_596)_01.jpg")
sandals from the [6th](6th_millennium_BC "wikilink") or [5th millennium
BC](5th_millennium_BC "wikilink") found in
[Spain](Spain "wikilink").\]\]
![](Egyptian_sandals,_vegetable_fiber_-_Bata_Shoe_Museum_-_DSC00009.JPG "fig:Egyptian_sandals,_vegetable_fiber_-_Bata_Shoe_Museum_-_DSC00009.JPG")

The oldest known sandals (and the oldest known footwear of any type)
were discovered in [Fort Rock Cave](Fort_Rock_Cave "wikilink") in the
[U.S.](United_States "wikilink") state of [Oregon](Oregon "wikilink");
[radiocarbon dating](radiocarbon_dating "wikilink") of the
[sagebrush](Artemisia_tridentata "wikilink") bark from which they were
woven indicates an age of at least 10,000 years.[1]

The word sandal is of Greek origin. The [ancient
Greeks](ancient_Greeks "wikilink") distinguished between *baxeae* (sing.
*baxea*), a sandal made of [willow](willow "wikilink") leaves, twigs, or
fibres worn by comic actors and philosophers; and the
*[cothurnus](cothurnus "wikilink")*, a [boot](boot "wikilink") sandal
that rose above the middle of the leg, worn principally by tragic
actors, horsemen, hunters, and by men of rank and authority. The sole of
the latter was sometimes made much thicker than usual by the insertion
of slices of cork, so as to add to the stature of the wearer.[2]

The [ancient Egyptians](ancient_Egyptians "wikilink") wore sandals made
of [palm tree](palm_tree "wikilink")-leaves and
[papyrus](papyrus "wikilink").[3] They are sometimes observable on the
feet of Egyptian statues and in reliefs, being carried by
[sandal-bearers](sandal-bearer "wikilink"). According to
[Herodotus](Herodotus "wikilink"), sandals of papyrus were a part of the
required and characteristic dress of the Egyptian priests.

In [Ancient Greece](Ancient_Greece "wikilink") sandals were the most
common type of footwear that women wore and spent most of their time at
home. The Greek sandals featured a multitude of straps with which they
securely fastened to the foot. The top of the sandals were usually of
colored leather. The soles were made of cattle skin, of even better
quality and made up of several layers. In [Ancient
Rome](Ancient_Rome "wikilink") residents used to carve their boots and
sandals with elaborate designs.

In Ancient [Levant](Levant "wikilink") sandals ("[Biblical
sandals](Biblical_sandals "wikilink")") were made from non-processed
leather and dry [grass](grass "wikilink"), and had strings or ropes made
of simple, cheap materials. Though, sometimes golden or silver beads and
even gems were added.

In his autobiography [Edward Carpenter](Edward_Carpenter "wikilink")
told how sandals came to be made in England:

## Construction

<img src="Anatomy_of_Sandals.svg" title="fig:Anatomy_of_Sandals.svg" width="250" alt="Anatomy_of_Sandals.svg" />
A sandal may have a [sole](sole_(shoe) "wikilink") made from
[rubber](rubber "wikilink"), [leather](leather "wikilink"),
[wood](wood "wikilink"), [tatami](tatami "wikilink") or
[rope](rope "wikilink"). It may be held to the foot by a narrow thong
that generally passes between the first and second toe, or by a strap or
lace, variously called a latchet, sabot strap or sandal, that passes
over the arch of the foot or around the ankle. A sandal may or may not
have a [heel](heel_(shoe) "wikilink") (either low or
[high](High-heeled_footwear "wikilink")) or heel strap.

    climates, usually using robust rubber outsole, suitable for any
    terrain, and softer [EVA](Ethylene-vinyl_acetate "wikilink") or
    Super EVA foam insole. These sandals are usually shaped to support
    the arched contour of the foot. The straps are usually made of
    polyester or nylon webbing for quick drying after exposure to water
    and to minimize perspiration.[5] Also suitable for many other
    adventure sports and activities where quick drying and reduced
    perspiration is required, including rafting, traveling, paragliding,

    name.

    translucent soft plastic in bright colours; hence the later name of
    jelly sandals or jellies. Recently, a whole range of styles have
    been produced in this material, mainly for women and girls, but the
    classic unisex design remains popular.
