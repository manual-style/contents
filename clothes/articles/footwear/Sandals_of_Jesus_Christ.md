The **Sandals of Jesus Christ** were among the most important
[relics](relic "wikilink") of the [Catholic
Church](Catholic_Church "wikilink") in the [Middle
Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink"). They were donated to [Prüm
Abbey](Prüm_Abbey "wikilink") by [Pope Zachary](Pope_Zachary "wikilink")
(741–752) and [Pope Stephen II](Pope_Stephen_II "wikilink") (752–757).

## Description

The sandals are the remains of an ornate fabric shoe (slipper) allegedly
from the [Merovingian](Merovingian "wikilink") period (5th to 8th
centuries), which were given to the Abbey by Rome in the
[Carolingian](Carolingian "wikilink") period (7th to 9th centuries).

They are considered to be among the most notable of the many relics of
the church; they are mentioned by [Pepin the
Short](Pepin_the_Short "wikilink") in the deed of 762, and he is said to
have received them from [Rome](Rome "wikilink") as a gift of Pope
Zachary (741–752) and [Pope Stephen II](Pope_Stephen_II "wikilink")
(752–757). Pope Zachary had recognized Pepin's election as king, and
Pope Stephen II completed the gift in 754. Apart from its religious
significance, the relic was the physical embodiment of the
[Frankish](Franks "wikilink") king's legitimation by the church.

Pepin managed the expansion of the small [Prüm
Abbey](Prüm_Abbey "wikilink") over 30 years, leaving it as a huge
property named Saint Salvador (Holy Saviour), the favourite monastery of
the Carolingian dynasty, which was legitimized by the relic.

## Competition

The possession of important relics was a means of sustaining church
influence and status. In order to compete with a powerful abbey it was
important to acquire relics of similar provenance and significance. In
the 12th Century the [Roman Catholic Diocese of
Trier](Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Trier "wikilink") became increasingly
powerful and obtained a robe thought to belong to Jesus. Called the
[Seamless robe of Jesus](Seamless_robe_of_Jesus "wikilink"), it was seen
as more significant than the sandals. Over the following four centuries,
Trier won the power struggle against Prüm and by 1524 had become the
major pilgrimage destination. In 1574, Prüm became subordinated to
Trier.
