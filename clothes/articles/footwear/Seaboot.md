rubber sailing wellingtons.\]\] **Seaboots**, also known as **sailing
boots**, are a type of waterproof [boot](boot "wikilink") designed for
use on deck on board boats and ships in bad weather, to keep the legs
dry, and to avoid slipping on the wet rolling deck. Marine footwear is
important in order to stay safe while sailing. Sailing boots are
designed to keep the sailor's feet dry and can be either rubber moulded
or more technical. The most common range of fabrics are
[Gore-Tex](Gore-Tex "wikilink") and leather.

Unlike [wellington boots](wellington_boot "wikilink"), seaboots have
non-marking, slip-resistant soles in order to avoid any damage to the
vessel's deck. They are also thinner, and require thermal socks as the
rubber does not provide enough warmth.
