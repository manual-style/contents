## Etymology

From the context of English language, 'Seven-league boots' originally
arose as a translation from the French 'bottes de sept lieues',[2]
popularised by [Charles Perrault's](Charles_Perrault "wikilink") fairy
tales. A league (roughly ) was considered to represent the distance
walked in an hour by an average man. If a man were to walk 7 hours per
day, he would then walk 7 leagues, or about . In the 17th century,
post-boys' boots were called 'seven-league boots'. While some suggest
that the '7 leagues' references the distance between post houses
(post-boys would only have their boots touch the ground at every coach
inn, when changing the horses), this is inaccurate: the distance between
coach inns was fixed at no more than 5 leagues.[3]
