![](Meylus_I.I._5.jpg "fig:Meylus_I.I._5.jpg"). \]\] **Sheepskin boots**
are [boots](boots "wikilink") made from
[sheepskin](sheepskin "wikilink"). The [wool](wool "wikilink") on
sheepskin has good insulating properties[1] and so such boots are
commonly worn when it is cold.

Sheepskin boots have been worn and used in colder climates since at
least 500 B.C. as a [Mummy](Mummy "wikilink") in
[Subashi](Subashi_(lost_city) "wikilink"), China has been uncovered
wearing a pair.[2] In [ancient Greece](ancient_Greece "wikilink"),
[Plato](Plato "wikilink") wrote that most people would wrap their feet
in warm felt and sheepskin during the hard winters in
[Potidaea](Potidaea "wikilink").[3] In the 19th century, traveller
William Knight observed sheepskin boots being worn by the people of
[Tibet](Tibet "wikilink"). Women dancers wore boots of variegated
colours while male horsemen wore large boots along with heavy sheepskin
trousers and coats.[4] The [Inuit](Inuit "wikilink") people of the polar
regions use sheepskin to make warm boots which have names such as
*kamipak* or *marnguaq*.[5] These are oiled to make them waterproof.[6]
In the Russian winter, the [peasants](peasant "wikilink") often wore
high boots lined with sheepskin to stay warm.[7]

Sheepskin boots were made in [Glastonbury](Glastonbury "wikilink") by
the [Quaker](Quaker "wikilink") firm of [Morlands](Morlands "wikilink").
These were popular and successful in the early days of motoring, as
open-topped vehicles were cold and windy. Morland boots were used by the
expedition of [Sir Edmund Hillary](Sir_Edmund_Hillary "wikilink") which
was the first to climb [Mount Everest](Mount_Everest "wikilink") in
1953. The boots were not used for climbing but for warmth when the
climbers were resting.[8]

[Aviators](Aviator "wikilink") need warm clothing if their aircraft are
unpressurised and the heating is inadequate. Sheepskin jackets, helmets
and boots were commonly used for this purpose in the 20th century.[9]
During [World War I](World_War_I "wikilink"), [Major Lanoe
Hawker](Lanoe_Hawker "wikilink") designed thigh-length sheepskin flying
boots which were made for him by [Harrods](Harrods "wikilink"). These
became popular in the [Royal Flying
Corps](Royal_Flying_Corps "wikilink") where they were known as *fug
boots*.[10][11] These were superseded by the 1930 and 1936 Pattern boot
followed by the introduction of the [Sidcot
suit](Sidcot_suit "wikilink") and more ordinary knee-length fleece-lined
boots were then used.[12] Arctic pilots needed especially warm wear and
continued to use heavy [suspender boots](suspenders "wikilink") of
sheepskin in place of trousers.[13] Both clothing and boots were
electrically heated as the technology for this became available.[14]

In Australia, a soft, slip-on sheepskin boot was developed which were
known as *[ugg boots](ugg_boots "wikilink")*[15] (There are a number or
derivations given for this name, including a cartoon character,
shorthand for "ugly", and the "fug" boots worn in World War
I).[16][17][18][19] This became popular with
[surfers](surfer "wikilink") for warming their feet after surfing in the
cold winter sea.[20] The [UGG Australia](UGG_Australia "wikilink") brand
was imported to the USA where they were sold in speciality retailers
such as surf shops.[21] They then became popular with actors, actresses
and influential celebrities such as [Paris
Hilton](Paris_Hilton "wikilink"), [Leonardo
DiCaprio](Leonardo_DiCaprio "wikilink") and [Oprah
Winfrey](Oprah_Winfrey "wikilink") so sales boomed.[22] There is fierce
competition for this market with rival brands such as [EMU
Australia](EMU_Australia "wikilink").[23]

Sheepskin boots are used in [nursing](nursing "wikilink") for bedridden
patients to prevent [bedsores](bedsores "wikilink"), especially at the
[heel](heel "wikilink").[24]
