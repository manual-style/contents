A **shoe** is an item of [footwear](footwear "wikilink") intended to
protect and comfort the human foot. Shoes are also used as an item of
decoration and [fashion](fashion "wikilink"). The design of shoes has
varied enormously through time and from culture to culture, with
appearance originally being tied to function. Additionally, fashion has
often dictated many design elements, such as whether shoes have very
high heels or flat ones. Contemporary footwear in the 2010s varies
widely in style, complexity and cost. Basic sandals may consist of only
a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost. High fashion
shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, use
complex construction and sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars
a pair. Some shoes are designed for specific purposes, such as
[boots](boot "wikilink") designed specifically for
[mountaineering](mountaineering "wikilink") or
[skiing](skiing "wikilink").

Traditionally, shoes have been made from leather, wood or
[canvas](canvas "wikilink"), but in the 2010s, they are increasingly
made from [rubber](Synthetic_rubber "wikilink"),
[plastics](plastic "wikilink"), and other
[petrochemical](petrochemical "wikilink")-derived materials. Though the
human foot is adapted to varied terrain and climate conditions, it is
still vulnerable to environmental hazards such as sharp rocks and
temperature extremes, which shoes protect against. Some shoes are worn
as safety equipment, such as steel-soled boots which are required on
construction sites.

## History

### Antiquity

sandals from the [6th](6th_millennium_BC "wikilink") or [5th millennium
BC](5th_millennium_BC "wikilink") found in [Spain](Spain "wikilink")

![](Romanwallinscotl00macduoft_raw_0263.png "fig:Romanwallinscotl00macduoft_raw_0263.png"),
Scotland.\]\]

The earliest known shoes are sagebrush bark [sandals](sandal "wikilink")
[dating](carbon_dating "wikilink") from approximately 7000 or 8000 BC,
found in the [Fort Rock Cave](Fort_Rock_Cave "wikilink") in the
[US](United_States "wikilink") state of [Oregon](Oregon "wikilink") in
1938.[1] The world's [oldest leather shoe](Areni-1_shoe "wikilink"),
made from a single piece of cowhide laced with a leather cord along
seams at the front and back, was found in the [Areni-1 cave
complex](Areni-1_cave_complex "wikilink") in
[Armenia](Armenia "wikilink") in 2008 and is believed to date to 3500
BC.[2][3] [Ötzi the Iceman](Ötzi_the_Iceman "wikilink")'s shoes, dating
to 3300 BC, featured brown bearskin bases, deerskin side panels, and a
bark-string net, which pulled tight around the foot.[4] The [Jotunheimen
shoe](Jotunheimen_shoe "wikilink") was discovered in August 2006:
archaeologists estimate that this leather shoe was made between 1800 and
1100 BC,[5] making it the oldest article of clothing discovered in
Scandinavia.

It is thought that shoes may have been used long before this, but
because the materials used were highly perishable, it is difficult to
find evidence of the earliest footwear.[6] By studying the bones of the
smaller toes (as opposed to the big toe), it was observed that their
thickness decreased approximately 40,000 to 26,000 years ago. This led
[archaeologists](archaeologist "wikilink") to deduce that wearing shoes
resulted in less bone growth, resulting in shorter, thinner toes.[7]
These earliest designs were very simple in design, often mere "foot
bags" of leather to protect the feet from rocks, debris, and cold. They
were more commonly found in colder climates.

Many early natives in [North America](North_America "wikilink") wore a
similar type of footwear, known as the [moccasin](moccasin "wikilink").
These are tight-fitting, soft-soled shoes typically made out of leather
or [bison](bison "wikilink") hides. Many moccasins were also decorated
with various beads and other adornments. Moccasins were not designed to
be waterproof, and in wet weather and warm summer months, most [Native
Americans](Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "wikilink") went
[barefoot](barefoot "wikilink").[8]

As civilizations began to develop, thong sandals (the precursors of the
modern [flip-flop](flip-flops "wikilink")) were worn. This practice
dates back to pictures of them in [ancient
Egyptian](ancient_Egypt "wikilink") murals from 4000 BC. One pair found
in Europe was made of [papyrus](papyrus "wikilink") leaves and
[dated](Carbon_dating "wikilink") to be approximately 1,500 years old.
They were also worn in [Jerusalem](Jerusalem "wikilink") during the
first century of the Common Era.[9] Thong sandals were worn by many
civilizations and made from a wide variety of materials. Ancient
Egyptian sandals were made from papyrus and palm leaves. The
[Masai](Maasai_people "wikilink") of Africa made them out of
[rawhide](rawhide_(textile) "wikilink"). In India they were made from
wood. In China and Japan, rice straw was used. The leaves of the
[sisal](sisal "wikilink") plant were used to make
[twine](twine "wikilink") for sandals in South America while the natives
of Mexico used the [Yucca](Yucca "wikilink") plant.[10][11]

While thong sandals were commonly worn, many people in ancient times,
such as the [Egyptians](Ancient_Egypt "wikilink"),
[Hindus](Hindus "wikilink") and [Greeks](Ancient_Greece "wikilink"), saw
little need for footwear, and most of the time, preferred being
barefoot. The Egyptians and Hindus made some use of ornamental footwear,
such as a soleless sandal known as a "Cleopatra", which did not provide
any practical protection for the foot. The ancient Greeks largely viewed
footwear as self-indulgent, unaesthetic and unnecessary. Shoes were
primarily worn in the theater, as a means of increasing stature, and
many preferred to go barefoot.[12] Athletes in the [Ancient Olympic
Games](Ancient_Olympic_Games "wikilink") participated barefoot—and
naked.[13] Even the [gods](Twelve_Olympians "wikilink") and heroes were
primarily depicted barefoot, the [hoplite](hoplite "wikilink") warriors
fought battles in bare feet and [Alexander the
Great](Alexander_the_Great "wikilink") conquered his vast empire with
barefoot armies. The runners of [Ancient
Greece](Ancient_Greece "wikilink") are also believed to have run
barefoot. [Pheidippides](Pheidippides "wikilink"), the first
[marathoner](marathon "wikilink"), ran from [Athens](Athens "wikilink")
to [Sparta](Sparta "wikilink") in less than 36 hours.[14] After the
[Battle of Marathon](Battle_of_Marathon "wikilink"), he ran straight
from the battlefield to Athens to inform the Athenians of the news.[15]

![](6_Schoen_inheemse_soldaat_LegioIIAugusta_BlackBox_endeLimes_fotoAvdOord.jpg "6_Schoen_inheemse_soldaat_LegioIIAugusta_BlackBox_endeLimes_fotoAvdOord.jpg")

The [Romans](Ancient_Rome "wikilink"), who eventually conquered the
Greeks and adopted many aspects of their culture, did not adopt the
Greek perception of footwear and clothing. [Roman
clothing](Clothing_in_ancient_Rome "wikilink") was seen as a sign of
power, and footwear was seen as a necessity of living in a civilized
world, although the slaves and paupers usually went barefoot.[16] Roman
soldiers were issued with [chiral](chiral "wikilink") (left and right
shoe different) footwear.[17] There are references to shoes being worn
in the [Bible](Bible "wikilink").[18]

### Middle Ages and Early Modern period

A common casual shoe in the [Pyrenees](Pyrenees "wikilink") during the
Middle Ages was the [espadrille](espadrille "wikilink"). This is a
sandal with braided jute soles and a fabric upper portion, and often
includes fabric laces that tie around the ankle. The term is
[French](French_language "wikilink") and comes from the
[esparto](esparto "wikilink") grass. The shoe originated in the
[Catalonian](Catalonia "wikilink") region of [Spain](Spain "wikilink")
as early as the 13th century, and was commonly worn by
[peasants](peasant "wikilink") in the farming communities in the
area.[19]

![](Walraversijde49.jpg "fig:Walraversijde49.jpg"), near
[Ostend](Ostend "wikilink"), [Belgium](Belgium "wikilink")\]\]

Many medieval shoes were made using the [turnshoe](turnshoe "wikilink")
method of construction, in which the upper was turned flesh side out,
and was lasted onto the sole and joined to the edge by a seam. The shoe
was then turned inside-out so that the grain was outside. Some shoes
were developed with toggled flaps or
[drawstrings](drawstring "wikilink") to tighten the leather around the
foot for a better fit. Surviving medieval turnshoes often fit the foot
closely, with the right and left shoe being mirror images.[20] Around
1500, the turnshoe method was largely replaced by the welted rand method
(where the uppers are sewn to a much stiffer sole and the shoe cannot be
turned inside-out).[21] The turnshoe method is still used for some dance
and specialty shoes.

By the 15th century, [pattens](Patten_(shoe) "wikilink") became popular
by both men and women in [Europe](Europe "wikilink"). These are commonly
seen as the predecessor of the modern [high-heeled
shoe](high-heeled_footwear "wikilink"),[22] while the poor and lower
classes in Europe, as well as slaves in the New World, were
barefoot.[23] In the 15th century, the
[Crakow](Crakow_(shoe) "wikilink") was
[fashionable](1400–1500_in_fashion "wikilink") in
[Europe](Europe "wikilink"). This style of shoe is named because it is
thought to have originated in [Kraków](Kraków "wikilink"), the capital
of [Poland](Poland "wikilink"). The style is characterized by the point
of the shoe, known as the "polaine", which often was supported by a
[whalebone](Baleen "wikilink") tied to the knee to prevent the point
getting in the way while walking.[24] Also during the 15th century,
[chopines](chopine "wikilink") were created in
[Turkey](Turkey "wikilink"), and were usually 7–8 inches (17.7–20.3 cm)
high. These shoes became popular in [Venice](Venice "wikilink") and
throughout Europe, as a [status symbol](status_symbol "wikilink")
revealing wealth and social standing. During the 16th century, royalty,
such as [Catherine de Medici](Catherine_de_Medici "wikilink") or [Mary I
of England](Mary_I_of_England "wikilink"), started wearing high-heeled
shoes to make them look taller or larger than life. By 1580, even men
wore them, and a person with authority or wealth was often referred to
as, "well-heeled".[25]

Eventually the modern shoe, with a sewn-on sole, was devised. Since the
17th century, most leather shoes have used a sewn-on sole. This remains
the standard for finer-quality dress shoes today. Until around 1800,
welted rand shoes were commonly made without differentiation for the
left or right foot. Such shoes are now referred to as "straights".[26]
Only gradually did the modern foot-specific shoe become standard.

### Industrial era

![](Shoemaker_1821.jpg "fig:Shoemaker_1821.jpg"), from *The Book of
English Trades*, 1821.\]\]

Shoemaking became more commercialized in the mid-18th century, as it
expanded as a [cottage industry](cottage_industry "wikilink"). Large
[warehouses](warehouse "wikilink") began to stock footwear, made by many
small manufacturers from the area.

Until the 19th century, shoemaking was a traditional handicraft, but by
the century's end, the process had been almost completely mechanized,
with production occurring in large factories. Despite the obvious
economic gains of [mass-production](mass-production "wikilink"), the
factory system produced shoes without the individual differentiation
that the traditional shoemaker was able to provide.

The first steps towards mechanisation were taken during the [Napoleonic
Wars](Napoleonic_Wars "wikilink") by the engineer, [Marc
Brunel](Marc_Brunel "wikilink"). He developed machinery for the
mass-production of boots for the soldiers of the [British
Army](British_Army "wikilink"). In 1812, he devised a scheme for making
nailed-boot-making machinery that automatically fastened soles to uppers
by means of metallic pins or nails.[27] With the support of the [Duke of
York](Prince_Frederick,_Duke_of_York_and_Albany "wikilink"), the shoes
were manufactured, and, due to their strength, cheapness, and
durability, were introduced for the use of the army. In the same year,
the use of screws and staples was patented by [Richard
Woodman](Richard_Woodman_(martyr) "wikilink"). Brunel's system was
described by [Sir Richard Phillips](Sir_Richard_Phillips "wikilink") as
a visitor to his factory in [Battersea](Battersea "wikilink") as
follows:

![](Bottoming_room.jpeg "fig:Bottoming_room.jpeg"), 1872.\]\]

> In another building I was shown his manufactory of shoes, which, like
> the other, is full of ingenuity, and, in regard to subdivision of
> labour, brings this fabric on a level with the oft-admired manufactory
> of pins. Every step in it is effected by the most elegant and precise
> machinery; while, as each operation is performed by one hand, so each
> shoe passes through twenty-five hands, who complete from the hide, as
> supplied by the currier, a hundred pairs of strong and well-finished
> shoes per day. All the details are performed by the ingenious
> application of the mechanic powers; and all the parts are
> characterised by precision, uniformity, and accuracy. As each man
> performs but one step in the process, which implies no knowledge of
> what is done by those who go before or follow him, so the persons
> employed are not shoemakers, but wounded soldiers, who are able to
> learn their respective duties in a few hours. The contract at which
> these shoes are delivered to Government is 6s. 6d. per pair, being at
> least 2s. less than what was paid previously for an unequal and
> cobbled article.[28]

However, when the war ended in 1815, [manual
labour](manual_labour "wikilink") became much cheaper, and the demand
for military equipment subsided. As a consequence, Brunel's system was
no longer profitable and it soon ceased business.[29]

Similar exigencies at the time of the [Crimean
War](Crimean_War "wikilink") stimulated a renewed interest in methods of
mechanization and mass-production, which proved longer lasting.[30] A
shoemaker in [Leicester](Leicester "wikilink"), Tomas Crick, patented
the design for a riveting machine in 1853. His machine used an iron
plate to push iron rivets into the sole. The process greatly increased
the speed and efficiency of production. He also introduced the use of
[steam-powered](steam-power "wikilink")
[rolling-machines](rolling-machine "wikilink") for hardening leather and
cutting-machines, in the mid-1850s.[31]

![](The_Shoe_for_'96.jpg "fig:The_Shoe_for_'96.jpg")'' for "The
Regal".\]\]

The sewing machine was introduced in 1846, and provided an alternative
method for the mechanization of shoemaking. By the late 1850s, the
industry was beginning to shift towards the modern factory, mainly in
the US and areas of England. A shoe stitching machine was invented by
the American Lyman Blake in 1856 and perfected by 1864. Entering into
partnership with McKay, his device became known as the McKay stitching
machine and was quickly adopted by manufacturers throughout [New
England](New_England "wikilink").[32] As bottlenecks opened up in the
production line due to these innovations, more and more of the
manufacturing stages, such as pegging and finishing, became automated.
By the 1890s, the process of mechanisation was largely complete.

On January 24, 1899, Humphrey O'Sullivan of [Lowell,
Massachusetts](Lowell,_Massachusetts "wikilink"), was awarded a
[patent](patent "wikilink") for a rubber heel for boots and shoes.[33]

Since the mid-20th century, advances in rubber, plastics, synthetic
cloth, and industrial adhesives have allowed manufacturers to create
shoes that stray considerably from traditional crafting techniques.
Leather, which had been the primary material in earlier styles, has
remained standard in expensive dress shoes, but athletic shoes often
have little or no real leather. Soles, which were once laboriously
hand-stitched on, are now more often machine stitched or simply glued
on. Many of these newer materials, such as rubber and plastics, have
made shoes less biodegradable. It is estimated that most mass-produced
shoes require 1000 years to degrade in a
[landfill](landfill "wikilink").[34] In the late 2000s, some shoemakers
picked up on the issue and began to produce shoes made entirely from
[degradable materials](Cradle_to_Cradle_Design "wikilink"), such as the
[Nike Considered](Nike_Considered "wikilink").[35][36]

In 2007, the global shoe industry had an overall market of
[$](United_States_Dollar "wikilink")107.4 billion, in terms of
[revenue](revenue "wikilink"), and is expected to grow to $122.9 billion
by the end of 2012. Shoe manufacturers in the [People's Republic of
China](People's_Republic_of_China "wikilink") account for 63% of
production, 40.5% of global exports and 55% of industry revenue.
However, many manufacturers in [Europe](Europe "wikilink") dominate the
higher-priced, higher value-added end of the market.[37]

### Culture and folklore

![](Shoehouse.jpg "fig:Shoehouse.jpg")\]\]
![](Shoes_and_Fruit_(p365_20).jpg "fig:Shoes_and_Fruit_(p365_20).jpg")\]\]

As an integral part of human culture and civilization, shoes have found
their way into our culture, folklore, and art. A popular 18th century
[nursery rhyme](nursery_rhyme "wikilink") is *[There was an Old Woman
Who Lived in a
Shoe](There_was_an_Old_Woman_Who_Lived_in_a_Shoe "wikilink")*. This
story tells about an old woman living in a shoe with a lot of children.
In 1948, [Mahlon Haines](Mahlon_Haines "wikilink"), a shoe salesman in
[Hallam, Pennsylvania](Hallam,_Pennsylvania "wikilink"), built an actual
house shaped like a [work boot](boot "wikilink") as a form of
advertisement. The [Haines Shoe House](Haines_Shoe_House "wikilink") was
rented to newlyweds and the elderly until his death in 1962. Since then,
it has served as an [ice cream](ice_cream "wikilink") parlor, a [bed and
breakfast](bed_and_breakfast "wikilink"), and a
[museum](museum "wikilink"). It still stands today and is a popular
roadside attraction.[38]

Shoes also play an important role in the [fairy
tales](fairy_tales "wikilink") *[Cinderella](Cinderella "wikilink")* and
*[The Red Shoes](The_Red_Shoes_(fairy_tale) "wikilink")*. In the
[movie](motion_picture "wikilink") adaption of the [children's
book](children's_literature "wikilink") *[The Wonderful Wizard of
Oz](The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz "wikilink")*, a pair of red ruby slippers
play a key role in the plot. The 1985 comedy *[The Man with One Red
Shoe](The_Man_with_One_Red_Shoe "wikilink")* features an eccentric man
wearing one normal business shoe and one red shoe that becomes central
to the plot.

Athletic sneaker collection has also existed as a part of urban
subculture in the United States for several decades.[39] Recent decades
have seen this trend spread to European nations such as the [Czech
Republic](Czech_Republic "wikilink").[40] A
[Sneakerhead](Sneakerhead "wikilink") is a person who owns multiple
pairs of shoes as a form of collection and fashion. A contributor to the
growth of sneaker collecting is the continued worldwide popularity of
the [Air Jordan](Air_Jordan "wikilink") line of sneakers designed by
[Nike](Nike,_Inc. "wikilink") for [Basketball](Basketball "wikilink")
star [Michael Jordan](Michael_Jordan "wikilink").

In the [Bible](Bible "wikilink")'s [Old
Testament](Old_Testament "wikilink"), the shoe is used to symbolize
something that is worthless or of little value. In the [New
Testament](New_Testament "wikilink"), the act of removing one's shoes
symbolizes servitude. [Ancient Semitic-speaking
peoples](Ancient_Semitic-speaking_peoples "wikilink") regarded the act
of removing their shoes as a mark of reverence when approaching a sacred
person or place.[41] In the [Book of Exodus](Book_of_Exodus "wikilink"),
[Moses](Moses "wikilink") was instructed to remove his shoes before
approaching the burning bush:

![](Salted_Lake_(Salt_Crystal_Shoes_on_a_Frozen_Lake).jpg "fig:Salted_Lake_(Salt_Crystal_Shoes_on_a_Frozen_Lake).jpg")
by [Israeli](Israel "wikilink") artist [Sigalit
Landau](Sigalit_Landau "wikilink")\]\]

The removal of the shoe also symbolizes the act of giving up a legal
right. In [Hebrew](Hebrew "wikilink") custom, the widow removed the shoe
of her late husband's brother to symbolize that he had abandoned his
duty. In [Arab](arab_people "wikilink") custom, the removal of one's
shoe also symbolized the dissolution of marriage.[42]

In [Arab culture](Arab_culture "wikilink"), showing the sole of one's
shoe is considered an insult, and to [throw a
shoe](Shoe_tossing#Insult "wikilink") and hit someone with it is
considered an even greater insult. Shoes are considered to be dirty as
they frequently touch the ground, and are associated with the lowest
part of the body—the [foot](foot "wikilink"). As such, shoes are
forbidden in [mosques](mosque "wikilink"), and it is also considered
unmannerly to cross the legs and display the soles of one's shoes to
someone when talking to them. This insult was demonstrated in
[Iraq](Iraq "wikilink"), first when [Saddam
Hussein](Saddam_Hussein "wikilink")'s statue was toppled in 2003, Iraqis
gathered around it and struck the statue with their shoes.[43] Secondly,
in 2008, [United States](United_States "wikilink") President [George W.
Bush](George_W._Bush "wikilink") had a shoe thrown at him by a
journalist as a statement against the war that was brought to Iraq and
the lives that it has cost.[44] More generally,
[shoe-throwing](shoe-throwing "wikilink") or shoeing, showing the sole
of one's shoe or using shoes to [insult](insult "wikilink") are forms of
protest in many parts of the world. Incidents where shoes were thrown at
political figures have taken place in [Australia](Australia "wikilink"),
[India](India "wikilink"), [Ireland](Ireland "wikilink"),
[Taiwan](Taiwan "wikilink"), [Hong Kong](Hong_Kong "wikilink"),
[Pakistan](Pakistan "wikilink"), the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink"), the [United
States](United_States "wikilink"), and most notably the [Arab
world](Arab_world "wikilink").[45][46]

Empty shoes may also symbolize death. In [Greek](Greece "wikilink")
culture, empty shoes are the equivalent of the American funeral wreath.
For example, empty shoes placed outside of a Greek home would tell
others that the family's son has died in battle.[47] At an observation
memorializing the 10th anniversary of the [September 11
attacks](September_11_attacks "wikilink"), 3,000 pairs of empty shoes
were used to recognize those killed.[48] The [Shoes on the Danube
Bank](Shoes_on_the_Danube_Bank "wikilink") is a memorial in
[Budapest](Budapest "wikilink"), [Hungary](Hungary "wikilink").
Conceived by film director [Can Togay](Can_Togay "wikilink"), he created
it on the east bank of the [Danube River](Danube_River "wikilink") with
sculptor [Gyula Pauer](Gyula_Pauer "wikilink") to honor the Jews who
were killed by fascist [Arrow Cross](Arrow_Cross_Party "wikilink")
militiamen in Budapest during [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink").
They were ordered to take off their shoes, and were shot at the edge of
the water so that their bodies fell into the river and were carried
away. The memorial represents their shoes left behind on the bank.

## Construction

The basic anatomy of a shoe is recognizable, regardless of the specific
style of footwear.

All shoes have a ****, which is the bottom of a shoe, in contact with
the ground. Soles can be made from a variety of materials, although most
modern shoes have soles made from [natural
rubber](natural_rubber "wikilink"),
[polyurethane](polyurethane "wikilink"), or [polyvinyl
chloride](polyvinyl_chloride "wikilink") (PVC) compounds.[49] Soles can
be simple—a single material in a single layer—or they can be complex,
with multiple structures or layers and materials. When various layers
are used, soles may consist of an insole, midsole, and an outsole.[50]

The **** is the interior bottom of a shoe, which sits directly beneath
the foot under the footbed (also known as sock liner). The purpose of
insole is to attach to the lasting margin of the upper, which is wrapped
around the [last](last "wikilink") during the closing of the shoe during
the lasting operation. Insoles are usually made of cellulosic paper
board or synthetic non woven insole board. Many shoes have removable and
replaceable footbeds. Extra cushioning is often added for comfort (to
control the shape, moisture, or smell of the shoe) or health reasons (to
help deal with differences in the natural shape of the foot or
positioning of the foot during standing or walking).[51]

The **** is the layer in direct contact with the ground. Dress shoes
often have leather or resin rubber outsoles; casual or work-oriented
shoes have outsoles made of natural rubber or a synthetic material like
polyurethane. The outsole may comprise a single piece, or may be an
assembly of separate pieces, often of different materials. On some
shoes, the heel of the sole has a rubber plate for durability and
traction, while the front is leather for style. Specialized shoes will
often have modifications on this design: athletic or so called cleated
shoes like soccer, rugby, baseball and golf shoes have spikes embedded
in the outsole to improve traction.[52]

The **** is the layer in between the outsole and the insole, typically
there for shock absorption. Some types of shoes, like running shoes,
have additional material for shock absorption, usually beneath the heel
of the foot, where one puts the most pressure down. Some shoes may not
have a midsole at all.[53]

The **[heel](Heel_(shoe) "wikilink")** is the bottom rear part of a
shoe. Its function is to support the heel of the foot. They are often
made of the same material as the sole of the shoe. This part can be high
for fashion or to make the person look taller, or flat for a more
practical and comfortable use.[54] On some shoes the inner forward point
of the heel is chiselled off, a feature known as a "gentleman's corner".
This piece of design is intended to alleviate the problem of the points
catching the bottom of trousers and was first observed in the 1930s.[55]
A heel is the projection at the back of a shoe which rests below the
[heel bone](Calcaneus "wikilink"). The shoe heel is used to improve the
balance of the shoe, increase the height of the wearer, alter posture or
other decorative purposes. Sometimes raised, the [high
heel](High-heeled_footwear "wikilink") is common to a form of shoe often
worn by women, but sometimes by men too. See also [stiletto
heel](stiletto_heel "wikilink").

The **** helps hold the shoe onto the foot. In the simplest cases, such
as sandals or flip-flops, this may be nothing more than a few straps for
holding the sole in place. Closed footwear, such as boots, trainers and
most men's shoes, will have a more complex upper. This part is often
decorated or is made in a certain style to look attractive. The upper is
connected to the sole by a strip of leather, rubber, or plastic that is
stitched between it and the sole, known as a
[welt](welt_(shoe) "wikilink").[56]

Most uppers have a mechanism, such as laces, straps with buckles,
zippers, elastic, velcro straps, buttons, or snaps, for tightening the
upper on the foot. Uppers with laces usually have a tongue that helps
seal the laced opening and protect the foot from abrasion by the laces.
Uppers with laces also have eyelets or hooks to make it easier to
tighten and loosen the laces and to prevent the lace from tearing
through the upper material. An [aglet](aglet "wikilink") is the
protective wrapping on the end of the lace.

The **** is the front part of the shoe, starting behind the toe,
extending around the eyelets and tongue and towards back part of the
shoe.

The **** is the part of the shoe closest to a person's center of
symmetry, and the lateral is on the opposite side, away from their
center of symmetry. This can be in reference to either the outsole or
the vamp. Most shoes have [shoelaces](shoelaces "wikilink") on the
upper, connecting the medial and lateral parts after one puts their
shoes on and aiding in keeping their shoes on their feet. In 1968, [Puma
SE](Puma_SE "wikilink") introduced the first pair of sneakers with
[Velcro](Velcro "wikilink") straps in lieu of shoelaces, and these
became popular by the 1980s, especially among children and the
elderly.[57][58]

The **** is the part that covers and protects the toes. People with toe
deformities, or individuals who experience toe swelling (such as [long
distance runners](long-distance_running "wikilink")) usually require a
larger toe box.[59]

## Types

There are a wide variety of different types of shoes. Most types of
shoes are designed for specific activities. For example,
[boots](boot "wikilink") are typically designed for work or heavy
outdoor use. [Athletic shoes](Athletic_shoe "wikilink") are designed for
particular sports such as running, walking, or other sports. Some shoes
are designed to be worn at more [formal](dress_shoe "wikilink")
occasions, and others are designed for casual wear. There are also a
wide variety of shoes designed for different types of dancing.
Orthopedic shoes are special types of footwear designed for individuals
with particular foot problems or special needs. Other animals, such as
[dogs](dog "wikilink") and [horses](horse "wikilink"), may also wear
special shoes to protect their feet as well.

Depending on the activity for which they are designed, some types of
footwear may fit into multiple categories. For example, [Cowboy
boots](Cowboy_boots "wikilink") are considered boots, but may also be
worn in more formal occasions and used as [dress
shoes](dress_shoe "wikilink"). [Hiking boots](Hiking_boots "wikilink")
incorporate many of the protective features of boots, but also provide
the extra flexibility and comfort of many [athletic
shoes](athletic_shoe "wikilink"). [Flip-flops](Flip-flops "wikilink")
are considered casual footwear, but have also been worn in formal
occasions, such as visits to the [White
House](White_House "wikilink").[60][61]

### Athletic

![](Puma_shoes.jpg "fig:Puma_shoes.jpg") [Athletic
shoes](Athletic_shoe "wikilink") are specifically designed to be worn
for participating in various sports. Since
[friction](friction "wikilink") between the foot and the ground is an
important force in most sports, modern athletic shoes are designed to
maximize this force, and materials, such as [rubber](rubber "wikilink"),
are used. Although, for some activities such as
[dancing](dancing "wikilink") or [bowling](bowling "wikilink"), sliding
is desirable, so shoes designed for these activities often have lower
coefficients of friction.[62] The earliest athletic shoes date back to
the mid 19th century were [track
spikes](track_spikes "wikilink")—[leather](leather "wikilink") shoes
with metal [cleats](cleat_(shoe) "wikilink") on the soles to provide
increased friction during running. They were developed by J.W. Foster &
Sons, which later become known as [Reebok](Reebok "wikilink"). By the
end of the 19th century,
[Spalding](Spalding_(sports_equipment) "wikilink") also manufactured
these shoes as well. [Adidas](Adidas "wikilink") started selling shoes
with track spikes in them for [running](running "wikilink") and
[soccer](Association_football "wikilink") in 1925. Spikes were
eventually added to shoes for [baseball](baseball "wikilink") and
[American football](American_football "wikilink") in the 20th
century.[63] [Golfers](Golf "wikilink") also use shoes with small metal
spikes on their soles to prevent slipping during their swing.[64]

The earliest rubber-soled athletic shoes date back to 1876 in the
[United Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink"), when the New Liverpool
Rubber Company made [plimsolls](plimsolls "wikilink"), or sandshoes,
designed for the sport of [croquet](croquet "wikilink"). Similar
rubber-soled shoes were made in 1892 in the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") by Humphrey O'Sullivan, based on
[Charles Goodyear](Charles_Goodyear "wikilink")'s technology. The
[United States Rubber Company](United_States_Rubber_Company "wikilink")
was founded the same year and produced rubber-soled and heeled shoes
under a variety of brand names, which were later consolidated in 1916
under the name, [Keds](Keds_(shoes) "wikilink"). These shoes became
known as, "sneakers", because the rubber sole allowed the wearer to
sneak up on another person. In 1964, the founding of
[Nike](Nike,_Inc. "wikilink") by [Phil Knight](Phil_Knight "wikilink")
and [Bill Bowerman](Bill_Bowerman "wikilink") of the [University of
Oregon](University_of_Oregon "wikilink") introduced many new
improvements common in modern running shoes, such as rubber waffle
soles, breathable [nylon](nylon "wikilink") uppers, and cushioning in
the mid-sole and heel. During the 1970s, the expertise of
[podiatrists](podiatrist "wikilink") also became important in athletic
shoe design, to implement new design features based on how feet reacted
to specific actions, such as running, jumping, or side-to-side movement.
Athletic shoes for women were also designed for their specific
physiological differences.[65]

![](A_classic_Black_pair_of_Converse_All_Stars_resting_on_the_Black_&_White_Ed._Shoebox_(1998-2002).JPG "A_classic_Black_pair_of_Converse_All_Stars_resting_on_the_Black_&_White_Ed._Shoebox_(1998-2002).JPG")

Shoes specific to the sport of [basketball](basketball "wikilink") were
developed by [Chuck Taylor](Chuck_Taylor_(salesman) "wikilink"), and are
popularly known as [Chuck Taylor
All-Stars](Chuck_Taylor_All-Stars "wikilink"). These shoes, first sold
in 1917, are double-layer [canvas](canvas "wikilink") shoes with rubber
soles and toe caps, and a high heel (known as a "high top") for added
support. In 1969, Taylor was inducted into the [Naismith Memorial
Basketball Hall of
Fame](Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame "wikilink") in
recognition of this development, and in the 1970s, other shoe
manufacturers, such as Nike, Adidas, Reebok, and others began imitating
this style of athletic shoe.[66] In April 1985, Nike introduced its own
brand of basketball shoe which would become popular in its own right,
the [Air Jordan](Air_Jordan "wikilink"), named after the then-rookie
[Chicago Bulls](Chicago_Bulls "wikilink") basketball player, [Michael
Jordan](Michael_Jordan "wikilink"). The Air Jordan line of shoes sold
$100 million in their first year.[67]

As [barefoot running](barefoot_running "wikilink") became popular by the
late 20th and early 21st century, many modern shoe manufacturers have
recently designed footwear that mimic this experience, maintaining
optimum flexibility and natural walking while also providing some degree
of protection. Termed as [Minimalist shoes](Minimalist_shoe "wikilink"),
their purpose is to allow one's feet and legs to feel more subtly the
impacts and forces involved in running, allowing finer adjustments in
running style.[68] Some of these shoes include the [Vibram
FiveFingers](Vibram_FiveFingers "wikilink"),[69] [Nike
Free](Nike_Free "wikilink"),[70] and [Saucony](Saucony "wikilink")'s
Kinvara and Hattori.[71][72] Mexican
[huaraches](Huarache_(running_shoe) "wikilink") are also very simple
running shoes, similar to the shoes worn by the
[Tarahumara](Tarahumara "wikilink") people of northern Mexico, who are
known for their distance running abilities.[73] [Wrestling
shoes](Wrestling_shoes "wikilink") are also very light and flexible
shoes that are designed to mimic bare feet while providing additional
traction and protection.

Many athletic shoes are designed with specific features for specific
activities. One of these includes [roller
skates](roller_skates "wikilink"), which have metal or plastic wheels on
the bottom specific for the sport of roller skating. Similarly, [ice
skates](ice_skates "wikilink") have a metal blade attached to the bottom
for locomotion across [ice](ice "wikilink"). [Skate
shoes](Skate_shoes "wikilink") have also been designed to provide a
comfortable, flexible and durable shoe for the sport of
[skateboarding](skateboarding "wikilink").[74] [Climbing
shoes](Climbing_shoe "wikilink") are rubber-soled, tight-fitting shoes
designed to fit in the small cracks and crevices for [rock
climbing](rock_climbing "wikilink"). [Cycling
shoes](Cycling_shoe "wikilink") are similarly designed with rubber soles
and a tight fit, but also are equipped with a metal or plastic cleat to
interface with [clipless
pedals](bicycle_pedal#Clipless_pedals "wikilink"), as well as a stiff
sole to maximize power transfer and support the foot.[75] Some shoes are
made specifically to improve a person's ability to [weight
train](weight_training "wikilink").[76]

### Boot

![](S3_safety_footwear.jpg "fig:S3_safety_footwear.jpg") safety
boots\]\]

A boot is a special type of shoe which covers the
[foot](foot "wikilink") and the [ankle](ankle "wikilink") and extends up
the [leg](human_leg "wikilink"), sometimes as far as the
[knee](knee "wikilink") or even the [hip](hip "wikilink"). Most boots
have a [heel](heel_(shoe) "wikilink") that is clearly distinguishable
from the rest of the [sole](sole_(shoe) "wikilink"), even if the two are
made of one piece. They are typically made of leather or rubber,
although they may be made from a variety of different materials. Boots
are worn both for their functionality—protecting the foot and leg from
water, snow, mud or hazards or providing additional ankle support for
strenuous activities—as well as for reasons of style and
[fashion](fashion "wikilink").

[Cowboy boots](Cowboy_boots "wikilink") are a specific style of [riding
boot](riding_boot "wikilink") which combines function with fashion. They
became popular among [cowboys](cowboy "wikilink") in the [western United
States](western_United_States "wikilink") during the 19th century.
Traditional cowboy boots have a [Cuban
heel](High-heeled_footwear#Men_and_heels "wikilink"), rounded to pointed
toe, high shaft, and, traditionally, no lacing.[77] They are normally
made from cowhide [leather](leather "wikilink") but may be made from
more exotic skins such as [ostrich](ostrich "wikilink"),
[anaconda](anaconda "wikilink"), or [elephant](elephant "wikilink")
skins.[78]

[Hiking boots](Hiking_boots "wikilink") are designed to provide extra
ankle and arch support, as well as extra padding for comfort during
[hiking](hiking "wikilink"). They are constructed to provide comfort for
miles of walking over rough terrains, and protect the hiker's feet
against water, mud, rocks, and other wilderness obstacles. These boots
support the ankle to avoid twisting but do not restrict the ankle's
movement too much. They are fairly stiff to support the foot. A properly
fitted [boot](boot "wikilink") and/or friction-reducing patches applied
to troublesome areas ensures protection against
[blisters](blister "wikilink") and other discomforts associated with
long hikes on rugged terrain.[79]

During [wet](water "wikilink") or [snowy](snow "wikilink") weather,
[snow boots](snow_boot "wikilink") are worn to keep the foot warm and
dry. They are typically made of [rubber](rubber "wikilink") or other
[water-resistant](water-resistant "wikilink") material, have multiple
layers of insulation, and a high heel to keep snow out.[80] Boots may
also be attached to [snowshoes](snowshoe "wikilink") to increase the
distribution of weight over a larger [surface
area](surface_area "wikilink") for walking in [snow](snow "wikilink").
[Ski boots](Ski_boots "wikilink") are a specialized snow boot which are
used in [alpine](alpine_skiing "wikilink") or [cross-country
skiing](cross-country_skiing "wikilink") and designed to provide a way
to attach the skier to his/her [skis](ski "wikilink") using [ski
bindings](ski_binding "wikilink"). The ski/boot/binding combination is
used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the
snow. [Ice skates](Ice_skate "wikilink") are another specialized boot
with a metal blade attached to the bottom which is used to propel the
wearer across a sheet of [ice](ice "wikilink").[81] [Inline
skates](Inline_skates "wikilink") are similar to ice skates but with a
set of three to four wheels in lieu of the blade, which are designed to
mimic ice skating on solid surfaces such as wood or concrete.[82]

Boots are designed to withstand heavy wear to protect the wearer and
provide good traction. They are generally made from sturdy leather
uppers and non-leather outsoles. They may be used for
[uniforms](uniform "wikilink") of the [police](police "wikilink") or
[military](military "wikilink"), as well as for protection in industrial
settings such as [mining](mining "wikilink") and
[construction](construction "wikilink"). Protective features may include
[steel-tipped toes](steel-toe_boots "wikilink") and soles or
[ankle](ankle "wikilink") guards.[83]

### Dress and casual

[Dress shoes](Dress_shoe "wikilink") are characterized by smooth and
supple leather uppers, leather soles, and narrow sleek figure. Casual
shoes are characterized by sturdy leather uppers, non-leather outsoles,
and wide profile.

Some designs of dress shoes can be worn by either gender. The majority
of dress shoes have an upper covering, commonly made of leather,
enclosing most of the lower foot, but not covering the ankles. This
upper part of the shoe is often made without apertures or openings, but
may also be made with openings or even itself consist of a series of
straps, e.g. an open toe featured in women's shoes. Shoes with uppers
made high to cover the ankles are also available; a shoe with the upper
rising above the ankle is usually considered a boot but certain styles
may be referred to as high-topped shoes or
[high-tops](high-top "wikilink"). Usually, a high-topped shoe is secured
by laces or zippers, although some styles have elastic inserts to ease
slipping the shoe on.

#### Men's

![](Blucher_(PSF).jpg "fig:Blucher_(PSF).jpg"), is distinguished by its
open lacing.\]\] Men's shoes can be categorized by how they are closed:

-   [Oxfords](Oxford_shoe "wikilink") (also referred as "Balmorals"):
    the vamp has a V-shaped slit to which the laces are attached; also
    known as "closed lacing". The word "Oxford" is sometimes used by
    American clothing companies to market shoes that are not Balmorals,
    such as [bluchers](bluchers "wikilink").
-   [Derby shoe](Derby_shoe "wikilink"): the laces are tied to two
    pieces of leather independently attached to the vamp; also known as
    "open lacing" and is a step down in dressiness. If the laces are not
    independently attached to the vamp, the shoe is known as a [blucher
    shoe](blucher_shoe "wikilink"). This name is, in American English,
    often used about derbys.
-   [Monk-straps](Monk_shoe "wikilink"): a buckle and strap instead of
    lacing
-   [Slip-ons](Slip-on_shoe "wikilink"): There are no lacings or
    fastenings. The popular [loafers](loafer "wikilink") are part of
    this category, as well as less popular styles, such as elastic-sided
    shoes.

Men's shoes can also be decorated in various ways:

-   Plain-toes: have a sleek appearance and no extra decorations on the
    vamp.
-   Cap-toes: has an extra layer of leather that "caps" the toe.
-   [Brogues](Brogues "wikilink") (American: wing-tips): The toe of the
    shoe is covered with a perforated panel, the wing-tip, which extends
    down either side of the shoe. Brogues can be found in both balmoral
    and blucher styles, but are considered slightly less formal.

Formal high-end men's shoes are manufactured by several companies around
the world, amongst others in Great Britain, France, Hungary, Romania,
Croatia, Italy, and to a lesser extent in the United States. Notable
British brands include: [Church's](Church's "wikilink") English Shoes
(est. 1873), [John Lobb Bootmaker](John_Lobb_Bootmaker "wikilink") (est.
1849), [Edward Green Shoes](Edward_Green_Shoes "wikilink") (est. 1890),
and Crockett & Jones (est. 1879). Both John Lobb and Edward Green offer
[bespoke](bespoke_shoes "wikilink") products. In between the world wars,
men's footwear received significant innovation and design, led by
[cobblers](Shoemaker "wikilink") and
[cordwainers](cordwainer "wikilink") in London's West End.[84] A
well-known French maker is [J.M. Weston](J.M._Weston "wikilink").
[Armani](Armani "wikilink") of Italy was a major influence on men's shoe
design in the 1960s–1980s until they returned to the larger proportions
of its forebears, the welt-constructed Anglo-American dress shoe
originally created in [Edwardian England](Edwardian_England "wikilink").
Another well-known Italian company is [Salvatore Ferragamo Italia
S.p.A.](Salvatore_Ferragamo_Italia_S.p.A. "wikilink"). Higher end
companies in the United States are [Allen
Edmonds](Allen_Edmonds "wikilink") and [Alden Shoe
Company](Alden_Shoe_Company "wikilink"). Alden, located in New England,
specializes in genuine shell cordovan leather from the only remaining
horse tannery in the USA, in Chicago[85] and is completely manufactured
domestically, whereas Allen Edmonds, of Wisconsin, is a larger company
that outsources some of its production.[86]

#### Women's

![](My_Shoes.jpg "fig:My_Shoes.jpg")
![](Red_High_Heel_Pumps.jpg "fig:Red_High_Heel_Pumps.jpg")

There is a large variety of shoes available for women, in addition to
most of the men's styles being more accepted as unisex. Some broad
categories are:

-   [High-heeled footwear](High-heeled_footwear "wikilink") is footwear
    that raises the heels, typically 2 inches (5 cm) or more above the
    toes, commonly worn by women for formal occasions or social outings.
    Variants include [kitten heels](kitten_heel "wikilink") (typically
    1½-2 inches high) and [stiletto heels](stiletto_heel "wikilink")
    (with a very narrow heel post) and wedge heels (with a wedge-shaped
    sole rather than a heel post).
-   [Mules](Mule_(footwear) "wikilink") are shoes or slippers with no
    fitting around the heel (i.e. they are backless)
-   [Slingbacks](Slingback "wikilink") are shoes which are secured by a
    strap behind the heel, rather than over the top of the foot.
-   [Ballet flats](Ballet_flat "wikilink"), known in the UK as
    ballerinas, ballet pumps or skimmers, are shoes with a very low heel
    and a relatively short vamp, exposing much of the instep. They are
    popular for warm-weather wear, and may be seen as more comfortable
    than shoes with a higher heel.
-   [Court shoes](Court_shoe "wikilink"), known in the United States as
    pumps, are typically high-heeled, slip-on dress shoes.

### Unisex

-   [Clog](Clog_(shoe) "wikilink")
-   [Platform shoe](Platform_shoe "wikilink"): shoe with very thick
    soles and heels
-   [Sandals](Sandal_(footwear) "wikilink"): open shoes consisting of a
    sole and various straps, leaving much of the foot exposed to air.
    They are thus popular for warm-weather wear, because they let the
    foot be cooler than a closed-toed shoe would.
-   [Saddle shoe](Saddle_shoe "wikilink"): leather shoe with a
    contrasting saddle-shaped band over the instep, typically white
    uppers with black "saddle".
-   [Slip-on shoe](Slip-on_shoe "wikilink"): a dress or casual shoe
    without shoelaces or fasteners; often with tassels, buckles, or
    coin-holders (penny loafers).
-   [Boat shoes](Boat_shoe "wikilink"), also known as "deck shoes":
    similar to a loafer, but more casual. Laces are usually simple
    leather with no frills. Typically made of leather and featuring a
    soft white sole to avoid marring or scratching a boat deck. The
    first boat shoe was invented in 1935 by [Paul A.
    Sperry](Paul_A._Sperry "wikilink").
-   [Slippers](Slipper "wikilink"): For indoor use, commonly worn with
    [pajamas](pajamas "wikilink").

### Dance

A wide variety of footwear is used by dancers. The choice of dance shoe
type depends on the style of [dance](dance "wikilink") that is to be
performed and, in many cases, the characteristics of the surface that
will be danced on.

-   [Pointe shoes](Pointe_shoe "wikilink") are designed for ballet
    dancing. These have a toe box that is stiffened with glue and a
    hardened sole so the dancer can stand on the tips of their toes.
    They are secured by elastic straps and ribbons that are tied to the
    dancer's ankles.
-   [Ballet shoes](Ballet_shoe "wikilink") are soft, pliable shoes made
    of canvas or leather, with either continuous or two-part sole (also
    called *split-sole*), used for ballet dancing. The sole is typically
    made of leather, with thicker material under the ball and heel of
    the foot, and thinner and thus more flexible material under the arch
    so that the foot can be easily pointed. They are typically secured
    by elastics across the top of the foot.
-   [Ghillies](Ghillies_(dance) "wikilink") are soft shoes that are used
    in [Irish dance](Irish_dance "wikilink"), [Scottish country
    dance](Scottish_country_dance "wikilink"), and [highland
    dance](Highland_Dance "wikilink").
-   [Jazz shoes](Jazz_shoe "wikilink") typically have a two-part
    rubberized sole (also called *split-sole*) to provide both
    flexibility and traction, and a short heel. They are secured to the
    foot by laces or elastic inserts.
-   Tango and [Flamenco shoes](Flamenco_shoes "wikilink") are used for
    [tango](tango_(ballroom) "wikilink") or
    [flamenco](flamenco "wikilink") dancing.
-   Ballroom shoes fall into two categories: Ballroom and Latin
    American. Both are characterised by [suede](suede "wikilink") soles.
    Men's ballroom shoes are typically lace-ups with one-inch heels and
    patent leather uppers. Ladies' ballroom shoes are typically court
    shoes with two-inch heels, made of fabric that can be colored to
    match the dancer's dress. In contrast to the low Ballroom heel,
    which evenly distributes weight across the foot, Latin American
    shoes have higher heels designed to shift weight onto the toes.
    Latin shoes are also more flexible than ballroom shoes. Men's Latin
    shoes typically have 1.5- to 2-inch high, shaped heels, while
    Ladies' Latin shoes have 2,5-inch to 3-inch heels. Ladies shoes are
    typically open-toed and strapped.
-   Dance sneakers are lightweight
    [sneakers](Sneakers_(footwear) "wikilink") with reinforced rubber
    toes that allows dancers to briefly stand on their toes. These are
    known by various trademarked names, such as dansneakers.
-   Foot thongs are slip-on, partial foot covers that cover the ball of
    the dancer's foot so as to reduce friction while executing turns,
    thus making it easier to perform turns and also protecting the foot
    from skin abrasions. From a distance, flesh colored foot thongs give
    a dancer the appearance of having bare feet. They are known by
    various names depending on the manufacturer, including dance paws,
    foot undies, and foot paws.
-   [Tap shoes](Tap_shoe "wikilink") have metal plates mounted to the
    bottoms of the toe and heel. The metal plates, which are known as
    *taps*, make a loud sound when struck against a hard performance
    surface. Tap shoes, which are used in [tap
    dancing](tap_dancing "wikilink"), may be made from any style of shoe
    to which taps can be attached.
-   Character shoes are leather shoes with one- to three-inch heels,
    usually with one or more straps across the instep to secure it to
    the foot. They may be soft-soled (suede) or hard-soled. They may be
    converted to tap shoes by attaching taps.

### Orthopedic

Orthopedic shoes are specially-designed footwear to relieve discomfort
associated with many foot and ankle disorders, such as blisters,
[bunions](bunion "wikilink"), [calluses](callus "wikilink") and corns,
[hammer toes](hammer_toe "wikilink"), [plantar
fasciitis](plantar_fasciitis "wikilink"), or heel spurs. They may also
be worn by individuals with [diabetes](diabetes "wikilink") or people
with [unequal leg length](unequal_leg_length "wikilink"). These shoes
typically have a low heel, tend to be wide with a particularly wide toe
box, and have a firm heel to provide extra support. Some may also have a
removable insole, or [orthotic](orthotics "wikilink"), to provide extra
arch support.[87]

## Measures and sizes

![](MarikinaRiverBankShoesjf9425_30.JPG "MarikinaRiverBankShoesjf9425_30.JPG")

The measure of a foot for a shoe is from the heel to the longest toe.
Shoe size is an alphanumerical indication of the fitting size of a shoe
for a person. Often it just consists of a number indicating the length
because many shoemakers only provide a standard width for economic
reasons. There are several different shoe-size systems that are used
worldwide. These systems differ in what they measure, what unit of
measurement they use, and where the size 0 (or 1) is positioned. Only a
few systems also take the width of the feet into account. Some regions
use different shoe-size systems for different types of shoes (e.g.,
men's, women's, children's, sport, or safety shoes).

[Units](Units_of_measurement "wikilink") for [shoe
sizes](shoe_size "wikilink") vary widely around the world. European
sizes are measured in *Paris Points*, which are worth two-thirds of a
centimeter. The UK and American units are approximately one-quarter of
an inch, starting at 8¼ inches. Men's and women's shoe sizes often have
different scales. Shoes size is often measured using a [Brannock
Device](Brannock_Device "wikilink"), which can determine both the width
and length size values of the foot.

## Accessories

-   Foam tap: a small foam pad placed under the ball of the foot to push
    the foot up and back if the shoe is too loose.
-   Heel grip: used to prevent the shoe from slipping on the heel if the
    fit is not perfect
-   Overshoes or [galoshes](galoshes "wikilink"): a rubber covering
    placed over shoes for rain and snow protection.
-   Shoe bag: a bag that protects shoes against damage when they are not
    being worn.
-   Shoe brush and polishing cloth: used to apply polish to shoes.
-   [Shoe insert](Shoe_insert "wikilink"), insole or inner sole:
    orthopedic or regular insert of various materials for cushioning,
    improved fit, reduced abrasion or to keep shoe fresh and increase
    its durability. These include padding and inner linings. Inserts may
    also be used to correct foot problems.
-   [Shoe polish](Shoe_polish "wikilink"): a waxy material spread on
    shoes to improve appearance and glossiness, and provide protection.
