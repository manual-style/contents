India.\]\] **Shoeshiner** or **boot polisher** is an occupation in which
a person cleans and buffs [shoes](shoe "wikilink") and then applies [a
waxy paste](shoe_polish "wikilink") to give a shiny appearance and a
protective coating. They are often known as **shoeshine boys** because
the job was traditionally done by a male child. Other synonyms are
**bootblack** and **shoeblack**. While the role is denigrated in much of
[Western civilization](Western_culture "wikilink"), shining shoes is an
important source of income for many children and families throughout the
world. Some shoeshiners offer extra services, such as [shoe
repairs](shoemaking "wikilink") and general
[tailoring](tailoring "wikilink"). Some well-known people started their
working life as shoeshiners, including singers and presidents.

## History

shows a person getting a shoeshine.\]\]

Shoe polish was not well known as a commercial product until the early
20th century. Throughout the late 19th century shoeshine boys plied
their trade on the streets, particularly those in the cities of the
United Kingdom. The earliest known
[daguerreotype](daguerreotype "wikilink") (photograph) of a human,
*[View of the Boulevard du
Temple](View_of_the_Boulevard_du_Temple "wikilink")*, features a man
having his shoes shined in the lower corner of the print.[1] Though the
image shows Paris' busy [Boulevard du
Temple](Boulevard_du_Temple "wikilink"), the long exposure time (about
ten or twelve minutes) meant that moving traffic cannot be seen;
however, the two men at lower left (one apparently having his boots
polished by the other) remained still long enough to be distinctly
visible.

## Modern profession

The profession is common in many countries around the world, with the
revenue earned by the shoeshiner being a significant proportion of a
family income, particularly when the father of the family has died or
can no longer work.[2] In [Afghanistan](Afghanistan "wikilink") some
children will work after school and can earn 100 Afghanis (around £1)
each day.[3] Many [street children](street_children "wikilink") use
shoeshining as their only means of income.

Some cities require shoeshiners to acquire licences in order to work
legally. In August 2007 shoeshiners in [Mumbai](Mumbai "wikilink"),
India were told that they could no longer work on the railway stations
due to "financial irregularities". Every Shoeshine Association was asked
to reapply for their licence, with many worried that they would lose out
to a rival.[4]
