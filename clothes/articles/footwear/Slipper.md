**Slippers** are light [footwear](footwear "wikilink") that are easy to
put on and off and are intended to be worn indoors, particularly at
home.[1]

## History

The recorded history of slippers can be traced back to the 12th century
when the Vietnamese had been wearing slippers. But in the West, the
record can only be traced to 1478.[2][3]

## Types

The following is a partial list of types of slippers:

-   Open-heel slippers – usually made with a fabric upper layer that
    encloses the top of the foot and the toes, but leaves the heel open.
    These are often distributed in expensive hotels, included with the
    cost of the room.
-   Closed slippers – slippers with a heel guard that prevents the foot
    from sliding out.
-   Slipper boots – slippers meant to look like boots. Often favored by
    women, they are typically furry boots with a fleece or soft lining,
    and a soft rubber sole. Modeled after [sheepskin
    boots](sheepskin_boots "wikilink"), they may be worn outside.
-   Sandal slippers – cushioned [sandals](sandal "wikilink") with soft
    rubber or fabric soles, similar to
    [Birkenstock](Birkenstock "wikilink")'s cushioned sandals.
-   Evening slipper, also known as the "Prince Albert" slipper in
    reference to [Albert, Prince
    Consort](Albert,_Prince_Consort "wikilink"). It is made of velvet
    with leather soles and features a [grosgrain](grosgrain "wikilink")
    bow or the wearer’s initials embroidered in gold.

Some slippers are made to resemble something other than a slipper and
are sold as a [novelty item](novelty_item "wikilink"). The slippers are
usually made from soft and colorful materials and may come in the shapes
of animals, animal paws, vehicles, cartoon characters, etc.

Not all shoes with a soft fluffy interior are slippers. Any shoe with a
rubber sole and laces is a normal outdoor shoe. In India, rubber
[chappals](chappal "wikilink") (flip-flops) are worn as indoor shoes.[4]

## In popular culture

The fictional character [Cinderella](Cinderella "wikilink") is said to
have worn glass slippers; in modern parlance, they would probably be
called glass [high heels](high_heels "wikilink"). This motif was
introduced in Charles Perrault's 1697 version of the tale, "Cendrillon
ou la petite pantoufle de verre" ("Cinderella, or The Little Glass
Slipper"). For some years it was debated that this detail was a
mistranslation and the slippers in the story were instead made of fur
(French: *vair*), but this interpretation has since been discredited by
folklorists.[5]

Derek "The Slipper Man" Fan holds the [Guinness World
Records](Guinness_World_Records "wikilink") record for wearing a pair of
dress slippers for 23 years straight as of June 30, 2007.[6]

A pair of [ruby slippers](ruby_slippers "wikilink") worn by [Judy
Garland](Judy_Garland "wikilink") in *[The Wizard of
Oz](The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film) "wikilink")* sold at Christie's in June
1988 for $165,000. The same pair was resold in May 2000 for $666,000. On
both occasions they were the most expensive shoes from a film to be sold
at auction.[7]

*Grandpa's Slippers* is an award-winning book by [Joy
Watson](Joy_Watson "wikilink").[8]

In Hawaii and many islands of The [Caribbean](Caribbean "wikilink"),
slippers, or "slippahs" is used for describing
[flip-flops](flip-flops "wikilink").

The term 'house shoes' (elided into *how-shuze*) is common in the
[American South](American_South "wikilink").[9]
