![](Muddy_Snow_Boots.jpg "fig:Muddy_Snow_Boots.jpg") A **snow boot** is
a type of [boot](boot "wikilink"), generally waterproof, or
water-resistant. The boot, in almost all cases, has a high side, keeping
snow from entering the boot, and a rubber sole, to keep water out.
Because of their water-resistant material, snowboots are often used in
wet, slushy, muddy, and, of course, snowy situations. This means not a
half inch dusting of snow, of water, but quite deep, heavy wet snow,
slush, or mud.[1]

## Uses

Snowboots are used by people to easily walk in snowy or wet situations,
and by children playing in snowy, relatively wet, or muddy lawns,
fields, etc. They are also usable for walking in streams in winter, as
they are well-insulated, while still waterproof.[2]

## Difference between snow boots and other boots

Snow boots have many differences between them

-   Snow boots are waterproof or water resistant, but winter boots are
    not.
-   The two boot types have different uses. The snow boot is used on
    very wet or snowy conditions, while winter boots are better used on
    well-maintained roads or paths, or even while shopping.
-   Snow boots are made of easy-to-clean materials, but winter boots are
    not. However, this cleanability and waterproofing comes at the cost
    that snow boots are heavier, less breathable, and more expensive.
-   Snow boots always extend partway up the leg, unlike hiking boots.
-   Snow boots are always moderately to heavily insulated, with the
    insulation under the waterproof/water-resistant layer.[3]
