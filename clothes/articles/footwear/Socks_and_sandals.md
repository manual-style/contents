Wearing **socks and sandals** together is a controversial
[fashion](fashion "wikilink") combination and social phenomenon that is
discussed in various countries and cultures. In some places it is
considered a fashion [faux pas](wikt:faux_pas "wikilink").[1]

## History

![](BLW_Pair_of_socks.jpg "fig:BLW_Pair_of_socks.jpg"). The split toes
were designed for use with sandals. Dating from 300–500, they were
excavated from [Oxyrhynchus](Oxyrhynchus "wikilink") on the Nile in
Egypt.\]\] The earliest evidence of wearing [socks](sock "wikilink") and
[sandals](sandal "wikilink") is documented at the archaeological site
between [Dishforth](Dishforth "wikilink") and
[Leeming](Leeming,_North_Yorkshire "wikilink") in [North
Yorkshire](North_Yorkshire "wikilink"), England. The discovery suggests
that [old Romans](Ancient_Rome "wikilink") wore socks with sandals at
least 2,000 years ago.[2]

## Reception

Saurabh Bhatia, the author of the book *Indian Corporate Etiquette*,
advises readers: "If, for some reason, you are not wearing socks with
sandals, ensure your toes are clean and your toe-nails are closely
clipped". Joshua Belter, the author of *The Book of Rules: The Right Way
to Do Everything*, points out that wearing socks with sandals reduces
the amount of cooling feet experience. However, energy design handbooks
include light socks and sandals as part of a high-[thermal
flux](thermal_flux "wikilink") tropical attire.

### Regional phenomenon

According to Brian Shea of *The Evening Sun*, wearing socks and sandals
is popular among the older generation and
[Germans](Germans "wikilink").[3]

The Britons are, according to *[The China
Post](The_China_Post "wikilink")*, "famed for fashion blunders like
wearing socks with sandals".[4]

Wearing socks and sandals is considered rather unaesthetic in the [Czech
Republic](Czech_Republic "wikilink"); however, some people prefer socks
and sandals, and a part of the population prefers both the options
(sandals with and without socks).[5]

Socks and sandals is a regular [Pacific
Northwest](Pacific_Northwest "wikilink") phenomenon.[6] Seattle based
insurance company [PEMCO](PEMCO "wikilink") used the "Sandals & Socks
Guy" character as part of a 2007 advertising campaign that portrayed
this as a typically Pacific Northwest fashion.[7][8] *[The Daily
Dot](The_Daily_Dot "wikilink")* highlighted "sandals and socks" as a
term entered into a [web search engine](web_search_engine "wikilink")
more often by Washingtonians than residents of any other state.[9]

### Subculture phenomenon

Wearing socks and sandals is associated by some with [geek
culture](geek_culture "wikilink"). Socks and sandals were noted as a
"high crime of fashion" when introduced as [Xbox Live
avatar](Avatar_(Xbox_Live) "wikilink") accessory [downloadable
content](downloadable_content "wikilink") in 2009.[10]

### Formal attire

While socks and sandals are most commonly associated with casual attire,
there is a small movement attempting to popularize the fashion choice
within the world of business fashion. Even the popular outdoor footwear
company, Chaco, has introduced a dress sandal line, called Wayfarer.

### 2010s fashion trend

In 2010, the newspaper *[Daily
Telegraph](The_Daily_Telegraph "wikilink")* reported that wearing socks
and sandals was a hit for spring/summer of that year.[11] Starting in
2010, and again in 2014, several sources reported that socks and sandals
had become a fashion trend in the United States and the United Kingdom,
appearing in several [runway shows](runway_show "wikilink"), including
those of [Miu Miu](Miu_Miu "wikilink") (2010) and [fashion
designers](fashion_design "wikilink") [Vivienne
Tam](Vivienne_Tam "wikilink") and [Mary-Kate and Ashley
Olsen](Mary-Kate_and_Ashley_Olsen "wikilink") (2014), and picked up by
celebrities.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]

## Health impact

For good hygiene, it is usual to change socks every day. The sock
captures sweat, debris and products of bacterial fermentation, which are
natural products of human skin, and otherwise would be deposited on the
inner surface of footwear. Socks prevent the penetration from the
footwear to the skin of substances that are released from the footwear
construction materials, biofilm and impurity.

Wearing shoes without socks could be related with risk of developing
fungal problems and infections.[20]
