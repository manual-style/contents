The **spectator shoe**, also known as **co-respondent shoe**, is a style
of low-heeled, [oxford](Oxford_shoe "wikilink"),
[semi-brogue](Brogue_shoe#Semi-brogues_(or_Half_brogues) "wikilink") or
[full brogue](Brogue_shoe#Full_brogues_(or_Wingtips) "wikilink")
constructed from two contrasting colours, typically having the toe and
heel cap and sometimes the lace panels in a darker colour than the main
body of the shoe. This style of shoe dates from the nineteenth century
but reached the height of popularity during the 1920s and 1930s.

## Description

Common colour combinations include a white shoe body with black, brown
or tan toe and heel caps, but other colours can be used. The spectator
is typically an all leather shoe, but can be constructed using a canvas,
mesh or suede body. The spectator was originally constructed of willow
calf leather and white buck or reverse calf suede. The white portion was
sometimes made from a mesh material, for better ventilation in hot
weather.

## Saddle shoe

The [saddle shoe](saddle_shoe "wikilink"), another style of two-tone
oxford shoe, can be distinguished from the spectator shoe by noting the
saddle shoe's plain toe and distinctive, saddle-shaped decorative panel
placed mid foot.

## Origin of name

[John Lobb](John_Lobb "wikilink"), the famous English footwear maker,
claimed to have designed the first spectator shoe as a
[cricket](cricket "wikilink") shoe in 1868.

In the 1920s and 1930s in England, this style was considered too
flamboyant for a gentleman, and therefore was called a tasteless style.
Because the style was popular among [lounge
lizards](lounge_lizard "wikilink") and
[cads](Rake_(character) "wikilink"), who were sometimes associated with
[divorce](divorce "wikilink") cases, a nickname for the style was
[co-respondent](co-respondent "wikilink") shoe, a pun on the colour
arrangement on the shoe, and the legal description of a third party
caught *[in flagrante delicto](in_flagrante_delicto "wikilink")* with
the guilty party in a case of [adultery](adultery "wikilink"). [Wallis
Simpson](Wallis_Simpson "wikilink") was famed for wearing this style,
although it was said that she was an adulteress and that it was [Edward
VIII](Edward_VIII "wikilink") who acted the part of co-respondent.[1]

## In television

In [J.G. Ballard](J.G._Ballard "wikilink")'s novel and [Steven
Spielberg](Steven_Spielberg "wikilink")'s film *[Empire of the
Sun](Empire_of_the_Sun "wikilink")*, protagonist Jim Graham ([Christian
Bale](Christian_Bale "wikilink")) covets a fellow prisoner's spectator
[golf shoes](golf_shoes "wikilink"). After the prisoner dies, he is
given the shoes as a gift from Dr. Ransome ([Nigel
Havers](Nigel_Havers "wikilink")).

In the 1992 film *[Hoffa](Hoffa "wikilink")*, [Jack
Nicholson](Jack_Nicholson "wikilink") and [Danny
DeVito](Danny_DeVito "wikilink") were supplied with spectators from
Wisconsin shoemaker [Allen Edmonds](Allen_Edmonds "wikilink")
(specifically the Broadstreet model).

In the 1920s-set crime drama, "[Boardwalk
Empire](Boardwalk_Empire "wikilink")", the character Enoch "Nucky"
Thompson, can be seen wearing pink-and-black spectators, especially in
the opening credits sequence.[2]
