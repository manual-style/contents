A **steel-toe boot** (also known as a **safety boot**, **steel-capped
boot** or **safety shoe**) is a durable [boot](boot "wikilink") or
[shoe](shoe "wikilink") that has a protective reinforcement in the
[toe](toe "wikilink") which protects the foot from falling objects or
compression, usually combined with a mid sole plate to protect against
punctures from below.

Although traditionally made of [steel](steel "wikilink"), the
reinforcement can also be made of a [composite
material](composite_material "wikilink"), a plastic such as
[thermoplastic polyurethane](thermoplastic_polyurethane "wikilink")
(TPU) or even [aluminum](aluminum "wikilink"). Steel-toe boots are
important in the [construction](construction "wikilink") industry and in
many industrial settings. [Occupational safety and
health](Occupational_safety_and_health "wikilink") legislation or
[insurance](insurance "wikilink") requirements may require the use of
such boots in some settings, and may mandate
[certification](product_certification "wikilink") of such boots and the
display of such certification directly on the boots. The markings on the
boot label will indicate the national or international standards that
the boot was intended to meet, and identify the level of protection
offered for impact, penetration, electric shock, and chemical hazards.
Safety shoes are effective in keeping the feet of industrial workers
safe from sharp and heavy objects while working in factories. Footwear
for use in chemical processing or semiconductor manufacturing may also
be rated to dissipate [static
electricity](static_electricity "wikilink") while still protecting the
wearer from electric shock.

Safety footwear now comes in many styles, including
[sneakers](Sneaker_(footwear) "wikilink") and [clogs](clogs "wikilink").
Some are quite formal, for supervising engineers who must visit sites
where protective footwear is mandatory.

Some brands of steel-toe footwear have become fashionable within
[subcultures](subculture "wikilink") such as
[skinhead](skinhead "wikilink"), [punk](Punk_fashion "wikilink"), and
[rivethead](rivethead "wikilink"). While brands that were previously
renowned within the fashion industry have also diversified into the
safety footwear market, industrial brands like
[Caterpillar](Caterpillar_Inc.#Financial_products_and_brand_licensing "wikilink"),
Rock Fall and JCB have also issued licenses to produce safety footwear.

## Safety criteria

### United States

![](OZAPATO_S3_Safety_Boot.jpg "OZAPATO_S3_Safety_Boot.jpg")

In the United States, the applicable standard for protective footwear is
[ASTM](American_Society_for_Testing_and_Materials "wikilink") standards
F2412-05, Standard Test Methods for Foot Protection and
[ASTM](American_Society_for_Testing_and_Materials "wikilink") F2413-05,
Standard Specification for Performance Requirements for Foot Protection.

OSHA requires compliance of
[ANSI](American_National_Standards_Institute "wikilink") Z41.1-1991,
"American National Standard for Personal Protection-Protective
Footwear," if purchased after July 5, 1994,[1] or
[ANSI](American_National_Standards_Institute "wikilink") standard "USA
Standard for Men's Safety-Toe Footwear," Z41.1-1967.[2] if purchased
before.

**California** has updated its regulations with the new 2005
[ASTM](American_Society_for_Testing_and_Materials "wikilink") standards
F 2412-05, Standard Test Methods for Foot Protection and
[ASTM](American_Society_for_Testing_and_Materials "wikilink") F 2413-05,
Standard Specification for Performance Requirements for Foot
Protection.[3]

Some safety shoes have symbols on the outside, to indicate the
protection that the shoe offers. These include:

-   **Green Triangle** indicates that it is a class 1 toe cap with
    puncture-resistant sole
-   **Yellow Triangle** indicates that it is a class 2 toe cap with
    puncture-resistant sole.
-   **White Square (with [Ω](ohm "wikilink"))** indicates electrical
    protection.
-   **Yellow Square (with SD)** indicates anti-static protection.
-   **Red Square (with C)** indicates electrically conductive.
-   **Fir Tree** indicates protection against chain-saws.

### Canada

![](CSABootSymbols.jpg "CSABootSymbols.jpg")

The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) have been using symbols on
safety footwear for more than 30 years., published in CSA standard Z195.
Each shape & color represents specific safety criteria for all safety
footwear and apparel purchased in Canada.

-   **Green triangle with CSA symbol** - Sole puncture protection with a
    Grade 1 protective toe. (Heavy work environment: construction;
    machine shops; where sharp objects are present)
-   **Yellow triangle with registered symbol** - Sole puncture
    protection with a Grade 2 protective toe. (Light industrial work
    environments)
-   **White rectangle with orange Greek letter [omega](omega "wikilink")
    and CSA symbol** - Soles that provide [electric
    shock](electric_shock "wikilink") resistance, with Ω (capital omega)
    being the symbol for [ohms](ohm "wikilink") of [electrical
    resistance](electrical_resistance "wikilink"). (Any industrial
    environment where live [electrical
    conductors](electrical_conductor "wikilink") can occur)
-   **Yellow rectangle with green letters "SD", a grounding symbol and
    CSA symbol** - Capable of dissipating an
    [electrostatic](electrostatic "wikilink") charge in a controlled
    manner. (Any industrial environment where a [static
    discharge](static_discharge "wikilink") can be a hazard for workers
    or equipment)
-   **Red rectangle with a black letter C, grounding symbol and CSA
    symbol** - Soles that are electrically conductive (Any industrial
    environment where low-power electrical charges can be a hazard for
    workers or equipment)
-   **White label with green [fir](fir "wikilink") tree symbol and CSA
    symbol** - Provides protection when using
    [chainsaws](chainsaw "wikilink"). ([Forestry](Forestry "wikilink")
    workers & others required to use a chainsaw)
-   **Blue Square with CSA symbol** - Grade 1 protective toe only. (For
    all other environments not listed above)

Generally, a safety shoe is a shoe that follows at least one of five
criteria. The criteria that a safety shoe adheres to can be found by
looking for the CSA (Canadian Standards Association) alphanumerical code
found inside the shoe. This code is made up of a combination of 5
different symbols:

-   1, 2 or 0;
-   P or 0;
-   M or 0;
-   E, S or C;
-   X or 0.

1.  The first code indicates if the shoe has a steel-toe cap (a metal
    shell embedded on top of the toes part of the shoe). "0" means there
    is none. "1" means that there is, and it resists an impact of 125
    joules (22.7 kg object falling from 56 cm above). "2" means that it
    resists an impact of 90 joules.
2.  The second code indicates if the shoe has soles that protect the
    arches of the feet from punctures. "P" means it does. "O" means it
    doesn't.
3.  The third code indicates if the shoe has a metatarsus protection
    against shocks and collisions. "M" means it does. "O" doesn't.
4.  The fourth code indicates the shoe's electrical properties. "E"
    means it resists electrical shocks. "S" means it disperses static
    electrical. "C" means it conducts electricity.
5.  This last code is found only on shoes that protect the foot from
    chainsaws, i.e. [chainsaw
    boots](Chainsaw_safety_clothing#Boots "wikilink"). "X" it does, "O"
    does not.

There is also EN ISO 20346:2004 [4] for protective footwear (must comply
to basic safety requirements but toe cap impact resistance requirement
is lower - 100 Joules) & EN ISO 20347:2004 for Occupational Footwear
(must comply to basic safety requirements with anti static or slip
resistant properties. This standard does not require a protective toe
cap)

## Use as a weapon

Steel-toe boots have been used in assaults, such as the attack on Josie
Lou Ratley, a Florida teenager.[5] Nightclubs and other entertainment
venues frequently include a "no steel toecaps" rule as part of their
[dress code](dress_code "wikilink") to mitigate the possibility of
serious injury to other patrons if the wearer becomes violent. Use of
[bovver boots](bovver_boot "wikilink") in [football
hooliganism](football_hooliganism "wikilink") was countered by warnings
to fans that they would have to remove such boots in order to attend
football matches.[6]
