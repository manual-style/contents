**The Original Car Shoe**, or simply **Car Shoe**, is a [high
fashion](high_fashion "wikilink") brand owned by
[Prada](Prada "wikilink").[1]

## Early years

Car Shoe was founded in 1963 by Gianni Mostile. The brand soon became
best known for its signature [moccasin](moccasin "wikilink") which
feature tiny rubber nubs. The brand earned a patent from the Italian
Ministry of Industry and Trade and its advocates included [Giovanni
Agnelli](Giovanni_Agnelli "wikilink"), U.S. President [John F.
Kennedy](John_F._Kennedy "wikilink")[2] and [Roberto
Rossellini](Roberto_Rossellini "wikilink").

## Prada takeover

In 2001, Car Shoe was assimilated by Prada, which soon opened stores in
[Milan](Milan "wikilink") and [Capri](Capri "wikilink") in the next two
years and introduced the line into over 200 major boutiques
internationally. Prada launched Car Shoe's first bags in 2004.

Car Shoe's traditional driving shoe is now available in a wide range of
colours and leathers, and even in a new children's collection.

Under Prada's control, Car Shoe sales have seen much growth. Its 2005
turnover of 17 million euros ($21 million) represented a remarkable 180%
surge in sales from 6 million euros ($7.5 million) in 2004, and its
sales increased by 33% in 2008 compared to the previous year.

According to Fashion Wire Daily, Car Shoe is one of six most copied
labels in the [Chinese capital](Chinese_capital "wikilink").
