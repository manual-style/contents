**Thigh-high boots**, known also as **thigh-length boots** or simply
**thigh boots**, are boots that extend above the knees to at least
mid-thigh. Other terms for this footwear include *[over-the-knee
boots](over-the-knee_boot "wikilink")* (abbreviated OTK boots; the full
term is also used for the 15th century riding boots for men, later
adopted by women) and, especially when cuffed, *pirate boots*. Lengths
vary from reaching just over the knee to reaching almost to the crotch
(referred to as *crotch boots* or *crotch-high boots*).

Thigh boots are made of materials ranging from various leathers to
various synthetic materials (including
[vinyl](Polyvinyl_chloride "wikilink"),
[polyurethane](polyurethane "wikilink"), or [latex](latex "wikilink"))
to various fabrics (such as silk or polyester
[microfiber](microfiber "wikilink")). Many are constructed with zippers,
but some are designed as pull-on boots. Heel heights vary, but most
styles are either flat or with heels greater than 3 inches (7.5 cm).
Heel styles vary from metal spikes to chunky. Like other boots, they can
also have [platform soles](Platform_shoe "wikilink").

Thigh boots are considered by many to be [erotic](erotic "wikilink") or
[kinky](Kink_(sexuality) "wikilink"). They are used as [fetish
clothing](fetish_clothing "wikilink") in [boot
fetishism](boot_fetishism "wikilink") and [shoe
fetishism](shoe_fetishism "wikilink"). Cheaper thigh boots are often
worn by prostitutes and [professional
dominatrices](professional_dominatrix "wikilink"), so many people
consider them icons of such trades. Because of the latter, they are
often associated with [sadomasochism](sadomasochism "wikilink").
Nevertheless, they are frequently sold by
[couture](Haute_couture "wikilink") designers, perhaps because of the
implied eroticism.

Thigh-high boots are more flattering on women with longer legs: "The
shorter you are, the less leg there is above the top of the boot, when
wearing footwear that ends above the knee. A very high heel helps to
give the illusion of height, but when there is much more boot visible
than leg; the effect is to optically foreshorten you."[1]

## History

### Late Victorian era

![](Stiefel_overknee_boots_circa_1900.jpg "fig:Stiefel_overknee_boots_circa_1900.jpg")
exhibit.\]\] Laced leather boots were fashionable throughout the
[Victorian era](Victorian_era "wikilink") for women. By the end of the
19th century, over-the-knee length laced leather boots were becoming a
trend among London prostitutes wanting a style that would appeal to foot
fetishists and clients interested in finding a
[dominatrix](dominatrix "wikilink").[2]

### 1960s

**Kinky boots**, also referred to as **fetish boots**, are
[boots](boot "wikilink") made typically with [patent
leather](patent_leather "wikilink") and high [stiletto
heels](stiletto_heel "wikilink").[3] Their extreme characteristics
intended to present a dramatic sexy appearance, such as by a
[prostitute](prostitute "wikilink") or
[dominatrix](dominatrix "wikilink"). Characteristics often include very
high heels, thigh- or crotch-high length, or unusual colors or
materials.

Boots of this type, and specifically the thigh-high leather boots worn
by [Honor Blackman](Honor_Blackman "wikilink") in her role as [Cathy
Gale](Cathy_Gale "wikilink") in *[The
Avengers](The_Avengers_(TV_series) "wikilink")*, are referred to in the
1964 song "[Kinky Boots](Kinky_Boots_(song) "wikilink")" by Blackman and
her *Avengers* co-star [Patrick Macnee](Patrick_Macnee "wikilink").

## In fashion

In the world of women's fashion, thigh boots run through cycles in both
popularity and design. As referenced by several authors, the popularity
of the motion picture *Pretty Woman* hurt the credibility of thigh boots
as wardrobe staples.[4] Nevertheless, in any fall fashion season, at
least one or more designers and retailers will take a chance on their
appeal.

Like shoes in general, fashion thigh boots are marketed through several
different channels. A key differentiator among these channels is the
[price point](price_point "wikilink") and construction:

-   [Couture](haute_couture "wikilink") fashion designers
-   Fashion designers
-   Couture shoe designers
-   Boutique brands
-   Fashion and shoe retailers

Couture fashion designers marketing thigh boots will vary from year to
year. Introducing a boot model is typically tied to the designer's theme
for the line. These boots will typically be marketed at the highest
price point for thigh boots and, usually, for shoes in general. Fashion
designers market similarly, though at a lower price point.

A number of couture shoe design houses regularly include thigh boots in
their collections, and the price point will be at a premium, just as
with the couture fashion designers. Examples of these designers are:

-   Brian Atwood
-   [Manolo Blahnik](Manolo_Blahnik "wikilink")
-   [Jimmy Choo](Jimmy_Choo "wikilink")
-   [Christian Louboutin](Christian_Louboutin "wikilink")
-   [Sergio Rossi](Sergio_Rossi "wikilink") (of Gucci Group)
-   [Stuart Weitzman](Stuart_Weitzman "wikilink")
-   [Giuseppe Zanotti](Giuseppe_Zanotti "wikilink") (of Vicini S.p.A.)

Couture fashion designers regularly use the shoe design houses to design
the boots and shoes for their collections.

Thigh boots are a regular staple of several Italian boutique brands,
including:

-   Gianmarco Lorenzi
-   Left and Right
-   Le Silla
-   Loriblu
-   Icône

The price point for these boots can be very high, particularly at retail
boutiques, but will vary more than for couture designers. Some brands
are available through [eBay](eBay "wikilink") sellers and clearance
sellers (e.g., [YOOX](YOOX "wikilink")) at discounted prices. The lowest
price tier is typically the fashion retailers. Retailers who regularly
market thigh boots in their line include:

-   [Aldo](Aldo_Group "wikilink")
-   [bebe](bebe_stores "wikilink")
-   [Victoria's Secret](Victoria's_Secret "wikilink")

### Autumn 2010

In Autumn 2010, thigh-high boots repeated as a fashion highlight from
Autumn 2009. Designers and fashion houses who showed them with their
designs included:

-   [Burberry Prorsum](Burberry_Prorsum "wikilink")[5]
-   [Christian Dior](Christian_Dior_S.A. "wikilink")[6]
-   [Hermès](Hermès "wikilink")[7]
-   [Vionnet](Vionnet "wikilink")[8]

### Autumn 2009

The Autumn 2009 fashion season featured thigh-high boots as a key
fashion accessory for the season, resulting in the style being declared
a fashion trend in early 2009. Reaching a wider audience through fashion
magazine editorials, the footwear style was shown in two different
feature layouts in the September 2009 issue of US *Vogue*.[9][10]
Numerous [high street](high_street "wikilink") fashion stores featured
thigh-high boots in their Autumn 2009 collections, with many fashion
designers also featuring them in their
[ready-to-wear](ready-to-wear "wikilink") collections.

[Miuccia Prada](Miuccia_Prada "wikilink") pushed the margins of fashion
with her thigh boots designed after [hip boots](hip_boot "wikilink") for
fishing.[11] One version even featured garters to suspend the tops from
a belt. Right behind her was [Stella
McCartney](Stella_McCartney "wikilink"),[12] featuring three
crotch-length boots with synthetic uppers, in following with her usual
animal-friendly practice. All three had snipped toes and extreme
[stiletto heels](stiletto_heel "wikilink"), and one featured a
multi-patterned, pierced upper.

Other design houses showing thigh boots in their Autumn 2009 lines
included:

-   [Alexander McQueen](Alexander_McQueen "wikilink")[13]
-   [Catherine Malandrino](Catherine_Malandrino "wikilink")[14]
-   [Celine](Celine "wikilink")
-   [Chloé](Chloé "wikilink")[15]
-   [Gucci](Gucci "wikilink")[16]
-   [Halston](Halston "wikilink")[17]
-   [Louis Vuitton](Louis_Vuitton "wikilink")[18]

As for the couture shoe designers, Christian Louboutin marketed no less
than four different styles in Autumn 2009 – a front-lacing mid-thigh
length with sculpted heel and hidden platform (Supra Fifré), a
crotch-length, skin-tight boot with hidden platform, a chunky mid-thigh
boot (Contente), and a chunky platform mid-thigh boot. In addition to
one heeled thigh boot featuring an elastic cuff just above the knee and
two pairs of flat over-the-knee boots in their couture line, Jimmy
Choo's limited edition [capsule
collection](capsule_collection "wikilink") for [H&M](H&M "wikilink")[19]
featured a mid-thigh black leather boot with a four-inch heel.

### Spring 2009

[Givenchy](Givenchy "wikilink")[20] kicked off the thigh boot trend
conspicuously out of season in early 2009 with a western-style thigh
boot in black leather.

### Autumn 2008

[Fendi](Fendi "wikilink")[21] supported the thigh boot cause in Autumn
2008 with a chunky suede boot that featured a metallic leather accent
around the ankle of the boot and at the top of the heel. The boot was
carried by several different retail outlets and was available in black,
brown, taupe, and gray.

### Autumn 2007

[Burberry Prorsum](Burberry_Prorsum "wikilink")[22] championed the thigh
boot in Autumn 2007 with a black [patent
leather](patent_leather "wikilink") model, which was shown with several
pieces from their medieval knight-inspired line. The boot featured a
four-inch heel and pointed toe.

### Autumn 2006

[Karl Lagerfeld](Karl_Lagerfeld "wikilink") styled all of his designs in
the Autumn 2006 [Chanel](Chanel "wikilink") collection[23] with thigh
boots. The boots were finished in a variety of materials, including
black suede and different shades of blue denim.

### Autumn 2005

[Karl Lagerfeld](Karl_Lagerfeld "wikilink") showed the Chanel[24] black
leather thigh boot with many of his Autumn 2005 designs that actress
Anne Hathaway later wore in *The Devil Wears Prada*, which made her a
fashion icon.

### Autumn 2003

[Narciso Rodriguez](Narciso_Rodriguez "wikilink")[25] created a stir in
Autumn 2003 when almost half the models in his ready-to-wear show were
wearing his thigh boots with his clothing line. The boots featured
four-inch heels and pointed toes. [Phoebe
Philo](Phoebe_Philo "wikilink") at [Chloé](Chloé "wikilink")[26] showed
leather and suede thigh boots in several colors, including red and
green, in addition to the more typical black and brown.

### Autumn 2001

[Roberto Cavalli](Roberto_Cavalli "wikilink")[27] showed many of his
designs in Autumn 2001 with his thigh boots. The boots featured
four-inch heels and pointed toes.

## Thigh-high boots in contemporary media

Thigh-high boots have been worn by many celebrities in recent years.
[Ariana Grande](Ariana_Grande "wikilink") has incorporated many styles
of thigh-high boots into her [signature
look](Trademark_look "wikilink"). Because of this many articles were
published advertising thigh-high boots, resulting in a surge of demand
for the item.[28] [29] This could also be linked to the fact that the
years of 2018-2019 saw a trend of popular [90's]('90's "wikilink")
trends becoming fashionable again.[30]
==Fetish==

![](Thigh_High_Boots.jpg "fig:Thigh_High_Boots.jpg")
![](Red-thigh-high-boots-dubidub.jpg "fig:Red-thigh-high-boots-dubidub.jpg")

Thigh boots as articles of [fetish clothing](Fetish_fashion "wikilink")
date back to at least the 1950s when [Irving
Klaw](Irving_Klaw "wikilink") used them in the costuming of the women in
his erotic photography. Since that time, they have been a staple of
fetish and adult photography. For instance, [Bob
Guccione](Bob_Guccione "wikilink") photographed the 1982
*[Penthouse](Penthouse_(magazine) "wikilink")* Pet of the Year, [Corinne
Alphen](Corinne_Alphen "wikilink"), in a pair of black leather thigh
boots for her feature layout. Similarly, [Dwight
Hooker](Dwight_Hooker "wikilink") photographed the
*[Playboy](Playboy "wikilink")* 25th Anniversary
[Playmate](Playboy_Playmate "wikilink"), [Candy
Loving](Candy_Loving "wikilink"), in white leather over-the-knee boots
for her layout.[31]

Until the 2000s, fetish thigh boots were generally distinguished from
fashion boots by being more extreme in many design dimensions,
particularly heel height and platform height. In the late 2000s, this
trend began to change as couture designers, particularly [Christian
Louboutin](Christian_Louboutin "wikilink"), began to experiment with
more extreme designs in their shoes. Consequently, the difference
between the two now is more a function of the materials used. In
particular, fetish thigh boots tend to be constructed of
[polyurethane](polyurethane "wikilink") (PU) or vinyl (often incorrectly
referred to as [patent leather](patent_leather "wikilink")). In
addition, they are generally produced in China and sold at low cost.
Some European cobblers have specialized in higher-priced thigh boots for
the fetish market.

## Iconography and symbolism in motion pictures

Motion pictures in which thigh boots were prominent in an actress'
wardrobe include:

-   In the 1990 film *[Pretty Woman](Pretty_Woman "wikilink")*, the
    protagonist, Vivian Ward (played by [Julia
    Roberts](Julia_Roberts "wikilink")), wears her black vinyl thigh
    boots throughout much of the first part of the movie as a symbol of
    her role as a prostitute.
-   In the 2006 film *[The Devil Wears
    Prada](The_Devil_Wears_Prada_(film) "wikilink")*, the protagonist,
    Andy Sachs (played by [Anne Hathaway](Anne_Hathaway "wikilink")),
    completes her ugly-duckling-to-swan transformation by strutting
    confidently into her employer's offices wearing a pair of Chanel
    black leather thigh boots.[32] Andy's wardrobe for this scene and
    the rest of the movie was styled by noted costumer, stylist, and
    designer [Patricia Field](Patricia_Field "wikilink").

<!-- -->

-   In the live-action versions of 101 Dalmatians and 102 Dalmatians,
    Glenn Close (Cruella) wears thigh high red PVC and thigh / crotch
    high black PVC boots respectively; boots end up in molasses, mud and
    caked in.
