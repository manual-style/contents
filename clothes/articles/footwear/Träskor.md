**Träskor** are Swedish [clogs](clog "wikilink"). Swedish clogs are
usually made from [alder](alder "wikilink"), but sometimes
[birch](birch "wikilink") or [pine](pine "wikilink") is used. Clogs are
mainly manufactured in the southern part of the country, both as
handicrafts and in factories. In 1905 there were 22 factories employing
241 people. One manufacturer is based in [Vollsjö](Vollsjö "wikilink")
in [Skåne](Skåne "wikilink"), clogs for business use are therefore
branded "Vollsjö slippers".

The most common model in Sweden is one with soles made of wood and
uppers of leather. Older models are usually entirely of wood, painted to
mimic leather or are sometimes richly painted with floral motifs.
