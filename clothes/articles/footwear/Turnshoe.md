A **turnshoe** is a type of [leather](leather "wikilink")
[shoe](shoe "wikilink") that was used during the [Middle
Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink"). It was so named because it was put
together [inside out](wikt:inside_out "wikilink"), and then was turned
right-side-out once finished: this hides the main seam between the sole
and [vamp](shoe#Vamp_(upper) "wikilink")—prolonging the life of the shoe
and inhibiting moisture leaking in through the seam.

In the beginning, turnshoes consisted of only one piece of leather sewn
on only one side. In the late early and the high medieval ages,
turnshoes mostly consisted of one [sole](shoe#Sole "wikilink") (cowhide
or bovinae) and one piece of [vamp or
upper](shoe#Vamp_(upper) "wikilink") (goat or cowhide or
caprinae/bovinae). In the [late Middle
Ages](late_Middle_Ages "wikilink"), additional elements were added, like
doubled soles.

Turnshoes were displaced by [welted shoes](Welt_(shoe) "wikilink") in
the beginning of the 16th century. Turnshoes were most often made in the
home.
