The ***tzangion***(, ), plural***tzangia*** (τζαγγία) was a type of boot
or sandal, which in the [Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink") became an
important part of the [Byzantine
Emperors](List_of_Byzantine_emperors "wikilink")'
[regalia](regalia "wikilink").

In the 4th century, the *tzange* was a type of elegant shoe, but its use
as an imperial vestment in Byzantium only began later, and was
influenced by eastern, most likely,
[Persian](Sasanian_Empire "wikilink"), usage. Thus the first occurrence
of the *tzangia* as a sign of royal power is in [John
Malalas](John_Malalas "wikilink")' description of the coronation of
[Tzath I](Tzath_I_of_Lazica "wikilink") as king of
[Lazica](Lazica "wikilink") under [Justin I](Justin_I "wikilink"), where
Tzath was dressed in Roman imperial garb, but wore *tzangia*, decorated
with pearls "in the Persian manner", rather than the Roman emperor's
*[kothornoi](cothurnus "wikilink")*. By the 9th century, the wearing of
red *tzangia* had become firmly associated with the imperial office, so
much so that rebels putting them on signified their
[usurpation](usurpation "wikilink") of the imperial title. In the
mid-14th century, [Pseudo-Kodinos](Pseudo-Kodinos "wikilink") reports
that the *tzangia* were tall boots decorated with eagles out of pearls
and precious stones.

The term is the root for the Greek term for shoemaker, *tsangaris*
(τσαγκάρης), via *tzangarios* (τζαγγάριος), although a maker of imperial
*tzangia* was called *tzangas* (τζαγγάς).
