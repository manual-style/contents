are a type of Japanese [slippers](slippers "wikilink") worn indoors at
home, school or certain companies and public buildings where street
shoes are prohibited.

Japanese culture mandates that people should remove their shoes when
entering homes and other buildings, especially where the floors may have
rugs, polished wood floors, or *[tatami](tatami "wikilink")* (grass
mats). *Uwabaki* are light, flexible shoes which are easy to slip on and
off, designated for indoor use. As they are not generally worn outside,
the soles are kept clean, and thus cleaning and maintenance of the
building's floors are kept to a minimum.

At the entrance of every school, from [preschool](preschool "wikilink")
to [college](college "wikilink"), there is a
*[genkan](genkan "wikilink")* with an assigned
[locker](Locker_(cabinet) "wikilink")
(*[getabako](getabako "wikilink")*) for each student to put his or her
*uwabaki*. A student's grade level is often indicated by a colored
stripe across the toes; the body color of the slipper is always white.
