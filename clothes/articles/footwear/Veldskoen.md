2015\|258x258px\]\] **Veldskoene** (or vellies, colloquial, alternately
velskoens; pronounced "FELL-skooner" (silent "r") or "FELL-skoons") are
[Southern African](Southern_African "wikilink") walking
[shoes](shoes "wikilink") made from vegetable-tanned
[leather](leather "wikilink") or soft
[rawhide](rawhide_(material) "wikilink") uppers attached to a leather
footbed and rubber sole without [tacks](tacks "wikilink") or
[nails](nail_(fastener) "wikilink").

The name comes from [Afrikaans](Afrikaans "wikilink") vel ("skin")
(later assimilated to veld ("field")) and skoene ("shoes"). They were
first made by the [Dutch East India
Co.](Dutch_East_India_Company "wikilink") in the 17th century by the
first [Dutch](Dutch_people "wikilink") settlers in South Africa. Their
design is believed to be based on the traditional
[Khoisan](Khoisan "wikilink") footwear observed by these settlers. The
footwear was later embedded into the Afrikaans psyche when velskoene
were used as the footwear of the [Great Trek](Great_Trek "wikilink").
Easy to make, lightweight and extremely tough, vellies could withstand
the harsh conditions of the great migration north. Vellies became part
of South African, [Zimbabwean](Zimbabwe "wikilink") (previously
[Rhodesian](Rhodesia "wikilink")) and [Namibian](Namibian "wikilink")
[society](society "wikilink"), worn by all classes and professions but
favoured by farmers and safari guides. Nathan Clark's company, [C&J
Clark](C._&_J._Clark "wikilink"), made the [desert
boot](desert_boot "wikilink") famous but Clark's design is modeled after
the same round toe and style last used to manufacture velskoene. Clark
was inspired by the shape and design of velskoene he discovered for sale
in the bazars of [Cairo](Cairo "wikilink"), which were imported to
[Egypt](Egypt "wikilink") from South Africa.
![](Veldskoen_Shoes.jpg "fig:Veldskoen_Shoes.jpg") They are sometimes
considered light [boots](boots "wikilink"), and can essentially be
considered a subset of [chukka boots](chukka_boots "wikilink") or desert
boots although vellies tend to have a lower topline.[1] Veldskoene soles
are sometimes cut from old car tyres rather than [crepe
rubber](crepe_rubber "wikilink").

Veldskoene saw considerable use by the [Rhodesian
Army](Rhodesian_Security_Forces "wikilink") during the [Rhodesian Bush
War](Rhodesian_Bush_War "wikilink") as tough light-weight boots. Vellies
along with canvas [Sneaker](Sneakers "wikilink") were also favourites of
the [Selous Scouts](Selous_Scouts "wikilink") as the creped sole made
going untracked easier than the heavy lugs normally found on infantry
boots.
