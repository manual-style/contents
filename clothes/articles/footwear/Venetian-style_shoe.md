**Venetian-style shoes** (**venetian-style
[loafers](loafers "wikilink")**) are mid-heel slippers with an
[upper](wiktionary:upper "wikilink") or top part that is slightly open
to the kick of the foot and the [ankle bone](ankle_bone "wikilink"). The
venetian-style shoe and its lack of ornamentation contrasts with the
[loafer](loafer "wikilink") which may have slotted straps,
[vamps](Shoe#Vamp,_or_upper "wikilink") and even
[tassels](tassels "wikilink"). The term came from [Great
Britain](Great_Britain "wikilink").[1]

Loafers are "slip-on shoes with a
[moccasin](Moccasin_(footwear) "wikilink") toe construction and slotted
straps stitched across vamps".[2] A loafer may even be "decorated with
metal chains or tassels".[3] A penny-loafer has a "tongue and strap".[4]

By the 20th century, the slip-on loafers were common male footwear.
During this period other popular shoes included low, laced
[oxfords](oxford_shoe "wikilink") in various leathers, ankle boots, and
specialized sport shoes. During the 1950s, the loafer became
fashionable.[5]
