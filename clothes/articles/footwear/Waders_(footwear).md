**Waders** denotes a [waterproof](waterproof "wikilink")
[boot](boot "wikilink") extending from the foot to the thigh, the chest
or the neck. They are traditionally made from vulcanised
[rubber](rubber "wikilink"), but available in more modern
[PVC](Polyvinyl_chloride "wikilink"), [neoprene](neoprene "wikilink")
and [Gore-Tex](Gore-Tex "wikilink") variants. Waders are generally
distinguished from counterpart waterproof boots by shaft height; the
[hip boot](hip_boot "wikilink") extending to the thigh and the
[Wellington boot](Wellington_boot "wikilink") to the knee. For the sake
of emphasis, therefore, waders are sometimes defined by the extent of
their coverage as **thigh waders**, **chest waders** or **full-body
waders**. As a [drysuit](drysuit "wikilink") variant, full-body waders
come with leaktight cuffs or gloves fitted to the sleeves and with a
leaktight collar or hood fitted to the neck, enabling the wearer to
remain dry when standing or walking in deeper water. Waders are
available with boots attached or can have attached stocking feet
(usually made of the wader material), to wear inside boots, or inside
[swimfins](swimfins "wikilink") in the case of [float
tube](float_tube "wikilink") fishing.

## Origin

The first manufactured waders were made as early as the 1850s by a
company called Hodgman. When rubber became popular around 1912, they
started making the waders out of this particularly waterproof and
durable material.[1] Then rubber was more or less perfected in 1942 for
World War II, so they used the same technology to make waders that are
closer to what we have today.[2]

## Types

There are two main types of waders: stocking-foot and boot-foot.
Stocking-foot is separate from the boot and connects to it, while
boot-foot includes the boot already.[3]

## Uses

![](Men_fly_fishing.jpg "fig:Men_fly_fishing.jpg") Waders have a wide
range of applications. For leisure purposes, they are worn while
[angling](angling "wikilink"), water [gardening](gardening "wikilink"),
playing with [model boats](model_boats "wikilink"), [waterfowl
hunting](waterfowl_hunting "wikilink"), and off-road riding of
[all-terrain vehicles](all-terrain_vehicles "wikilink"). In the world of
work, heavy-duty waders are used predominantly in the [chemical
industry](chemical_industry "wikilink"),
[agriculture](agriculture "wikilink"),
[aquaculture](aquaculture "wikilink") and in the maintenance of
[water](water "wikilink") supply, [sewerage](sanitary_sewer "wikilink")
and other utilities. Waders are frequently worn by
[pastors](pastors "wikilink") during full-immersion
[baptism](baptism "wikilink") and they have an important application
during [flooding](flood "wikilink"), when walking outdoors or indoors.

[Trench foot](Trench_foot "wikilink") is common in those who spend a lot
of time in the water without proper protection. People like fly
fishermen use waders because they stay in the water for hours on end,
and they need the proper protection.[4]

Depending on the kind of fish that the fisherman is catching, they might
not need waders. Some fish are best caught on land. But some fish are
best caught when the fisherman is soaked and chest deep in the water.
Waders are also essential for keeping warm during colder months, because
they keep the cold water off the skin, which otherwise could cause
hypothermia or other problems. However many fishermen use them even in
the summer to keep dry, but waders can get hot so sometimes men wear
nothing but their boxers under chest waders.

## Environmental impact

Many states in the US are beginning to ban certain types of waders,
specifically those with porous, felt soles. These kinds of soles easily
host various types of invasive species that could be carried from one
water source to another. The invasive organisms and plants pose a threat
to fish stocks and important fish habitats. For example, effective March
1, 2012, most counties in Missouri ban these kinds of waders while sport
fishing in fresh water.[5] And in all of Alaska, as of January 1, 2012,
the same law applies.[6] In New Zealand, the use of felt-soled waders
and boots for sports fishing was banned in 2008 as part of the
containment measures put in place following the discovery of the
invasive alga, [didymo](Didymosphenia_geminata "wikilink"), in South
Island rivers in 2004.[7]
