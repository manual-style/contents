![](Waraji_on_tatami.jpg "fig:Waraji_on_tatami.jpg")\]\] are
[sandals](sandal_(footwear) "wikilink") made from
[straw](straw "wikilink") [rope](rope "wikilink") that in the past were
the standard footwear of the common people in Japan.

## Use

Waraji are basically a form of [zōri](Zōri "wikilink"), so they are worn
very similarly. The main difference (in wear) between zōri and waraji is
that one's toes traditionally protrude slightly over the edge of the
waraji. This does not happen with zōri. The other difference is that one
normally doesn't wear [tabi](tabi "wikilink") with waraji, as opposed to
zōri.

Nowadays, it is mainly Buddhist monks who wear waraji. Most Japanese
wear zōri or [geta](Geta_(footwear) "wikilink").

### Tying

Everyone tied their waraji differently from one another. There was no
standard way to tie waraji.
