Wellington boots, c. 1845\]\] The **Wellington boot** was originally a
type of leather [boot](boot "wikilink") adapted from [Hessian
boots](Hessian_(boot) "wikilink"). They were worn and popularised by
[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of
Wellington](Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington "wikilink"). The
"Wellington" boot became a staple of practical foot wear for the British
[aristocracy](aristocracy "wikilink") and middle class in the early 19th
century. The name was subsequently given to waterproof boots made of
rubber and they are no longer associated with a particular class. They
are now commonly used for a range of agricultural and outdoors pursuits.

## Design and use

![](Sailing_boots.jpg "fig:Sailing_boots.jpg"), [Le
Chameau](Le_Chameau "wikilink"), Jeantex,
[Aigle](Aigle_(company) "wikilink"), Gill,
[Helly-Hansen](Helly-Hansen "wikilink") and Newport short and tall
rubber sailing wellingtons.\]\] Wellington boots in contemporary usage
are waterproof and are most often made from rubber or [polyvinyl
chloride](polyvinyl_chloride "wikilink") (PVC), a
[halogenated](halogenated "wikilink") [polymer](polymer "wikilink").
They are usually worn when walking on wet or muddy ground, or to protect
the wearer from heavy showers and [puddles](puddles "wikilink"). They
are generally just below knee-high although shorter boots are available.

The "Wellington" is a common and necessary safety or hygiene shoe in
diverse industrial settings: for heavy industry with an integrated
reinforced toe; protection from mud and grime in
[mines](Mining "wikilink"), from chemical spills in chemical plants and
from water, dirt, and mud in horticultural and agricultural work; and
serving the high standard of hygiene required in [food
processing](food_processing "wikilink") plants, [operating
theatres](operating_theater "wikilink"), and dust-free [clean
rooms](clean_room "wikilink") for electronics manufacture.

[Sailing wear](Sailing_wear "wikilink") includes short and tall
[sailing](sailing "wikilink") wellingtons with non-marking,
slip-resistant soles to avoid damage to a boat's deck. These boots
require thermal socks to be worn underneath as the rubber does not
provide enough warmth.

## History

### Origins

![](DukeWellingtonJamesLonsdale.jpg "fig:DukeWellingtonJamesLonsdale.jpg")
at [Waterloo](Battle_of_Waterloo "wikilink"). By [James
Lonsdale](James_Lonsdale_(painter) "wikilink"), 1815. Here he is
portrayed wearing tasselled Hessian boots\]\]

The [Duke of
Wellington](Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington "wikilink")
instructed his shoemaker, Hoby of St. James's Street, London, to modify
the 18th-century [Hessian boot](Hessian_(boot) "wikilink"). The
resulting new boot was fabricated in soft calfskin leather, had the trim
removed and was cut to fit more closely around the leg. The heels were
low cut, stacked around an inch (2.5 centimetres), and the boot stopped
at mid-calf. It was suitably hard-wearing for riding, yet smart enough
for informal evening wear. The boot was dubbed the *Wellington* and the
name has stuck in English ever since. In the 1815 portrait by James
Lonsdale, the Duke can be seen wearing the more formal Hessian style
boots, which are tasselled.[1]

Wellington's utilitarian new boots quickly caught on with patriotic
British gentlemen eager to emulate their war hero.[2] Considered
fashionable and foppish in the best circles and worn by
[dandies](dandies "wikilink"), such as [Beau
Brummell](Beau_Brummell "wikilink"), they remained the main fashion for
men through the 1840s. In the 1850s they were more commonly made in the
calf-high version, and in the 1860s they were both superseded by the
ankle boot, except for riding. Wellington is one of the two British
Prime Ministers to have given his name to an item of clothing, the other
being [Sir Anthony Eden](Sir_Anthony_Eden "wikilink") (see [Anthony Eden
hat](Anthony_Eden_hat "wikilink")) whilst [Sir Winston
Churchill](Sir_Winston_Churchill "wikilink") gave his name to a
[cigar](cigar "wikilink"), and William Gladstone (four times prime
minister between 1868 and 1894) gave his to the [Gladstone
Bag](Gladstone_Bag "wikilink"), the classic doctor's
[portmanteau](portmanteau_(luggage) "wikilink").

### Modifications

Wellington boots were at first made of leather. However, in 1852 [Hiram
Hutchinson](Hiram_Hutchinson "wikilink") met [Charles
Goodyear](Charles_Goodyear "wikilink"), who had just invented the
[sulfur vulcanisation](sulfur_vulcanisation "wikilink") process for
natural rubber. While Goodyear decided to manufacture tyres, Hutchinson
bought the patent to manufacture footwear and moved to France to
establish *À l'Aigle* ("to the Eagle") in 1853, to honour his home
country. Today the company is simply called
[Aigle](Aigle_(company) "wikilink"). In a country where 95% of the
population were working on fields with [wooden
clogs](clog_(shoe) "wikilink") as they had been for generations, the
introduction of the wholly waterproof, Wellington-type rubber boot
became an instant success: farmers would be able to come back home with
clean, dry feet.

### Production in World War I

Production of the Wellington boot was dramatically boosted with the
advent of [World War I](World_War_I "wikilink") and a requirement for
footwear suitable for the conditions in Europe's flooded and muddy
[trenches](trench_warfare "wikilink"). The North British Rubber Company
(now [Hunter Boot Ltd](Hunter_Boot_Ltd "wikilink")) was asked by the
[War Office](War_Office "wikilink") to construct a boot suitable for
such conditions. The mills ran day and night to produce immense
quantities of these trench boots. In total, 1,185,036 pairs were made to
meet the [British Army](British_Army "wikilink")'s demands.

### Production in World War II

In [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), Hunter Boot was again
requested to supply vast quantities of Wellington and thigh boots. 80%
of production was of war materials – from (rubber) ground sheets to life
belts and gas masks. In the [Netherlands](Netherlands "wikilink"), the
British forces were working in flooded conditions which demanded
Wellingtons and thigh boots in vast supplies.

By the end of the war in 1945, the Wellington had become popular among
men, women and children for wet weather wear. The boot had developed to
become far roomier with a thick sole and rounded toe. Also, with the
rationing of that time, labourers began to use them for daily work.

### Post-war

![](Hunter_rainboots.jpg "fig:Hunter_rainboots.jpg") wellington
boots\]\]

The lower cost and ease of rubber "Wellington" boot manufacture, and
being entirely waterproof, lent itself immediately to being the
preferred protective material to leather in all forms of industry.
Increased attention to occupational health and safety requirements led
to the [steel toe](steel_toe "wikilink") or steel-capped Wellington: a
protective (commonly internal) toe-capping to protect the foot from
crush and puncture injuries. Although traditionally made of steel, the
reinforcement may be a composite or a plastic material such as
[thermoplastic polyurethane](thermoplastic_polyurethane "wikilink")
(TPU). Such steel-toe Wellingtons are nearly indispensable in an
enormous range of industry and are often mandatory wear to meet local
occupational health and safety legislation or insurance requirements.

In July 1956, the [Monopolies and Restrictive Practices
Commission](Competition_Commission "wikilink") published its *Report on
the Supply of Certain Rubber Footwear*,[3] which covered rubber boots of
all kinds including wellingtons and overboots. This 107-page official
publication addressed contemporary concerns about unfair pricing of
rubber footwear manufactured in the UK or imported from overseas. The
appendices include lists of rubber footwear manufacturers and
price-lists of each company's range of wellington boots available in the
mid-1950s.

Green Wellington boots, introduced by [Hunter Boot
Ltd](Hunter_Boot_Ltd "wikilink") in 1955, gradually became a shorthand
for "country life" in the UK.[4] In 1980, sales of their boots
skyrocketed after Lady Diana Spencer (future [Princess
Diana](Diana,_Princess_of_Wales "wikilink")) was pictured wearing a pair
on the Balmoral estate during her courtship with Prince Charles.[5][6]

## Usage and terminology

![](Gummistiefel_bunt_fcm.jpg "Gummistiefel_bunt_fcm.jpg")

### Australia

Though most commonly called "gum boots", an alternative name, "Blucher
Boot", is occasionally used by some older Australians.
[Blücher](Gebhard_Leberecht_von_Blücher "wikilink") was Wellington's
colleague at the [Battle of Waterloo](Battle_of_Waterloo "wikilink") and
there is speculation that some early emigrants to Australia, remembering
the battle, may have confused a different design the [Blucher
shoe](Blucher_shoe "wikilink") developed by Blucher. The Australian poet
[Henry Lawson](Henry_Lawson "wikilink") wrote a poem to a pair of
Blucher Boots in 1890.[7]

### North America

Usually called rubber boots, but sometimes
[galoshes](galoshes "wikilink"), mud boots, rain boots, mucking boots,
billy boots, or gum-boots, are popular in Canada and the United States,
particularly in springtime when melting snows leave wet and muddy
ground. Young people can be seen wearing them to school or university
and taking them to summer camps.

While green is popular in Britain, red-soled black rubber boots are
often seen in the United States, in addition to Canadian styles. Rubber
boots specifically made for cold weather, lined with warm insulating
material, are especially popular practical footwear for Canadian
winters. This same style of lined boot is also popular among those who
work in or near the ocean as one can wade in and out of shallow, but
cold, ocean water, while staying dry and warm.

In the US white mid-calf rubber boots are worn by workers on [shrimp
boats](Shrimp_fishery "wikilink") and construction workers pouring
concrete.

Leather boots similar to Wellington's original [Hessian
boots](Hessian_(boot) "wikilink") have been marketed in North America as
"Ranch Wellingtons" or "Western Wellingtons". These boots have more
rounded toes, lower heels, and less radically scalloped tops than
typical "[cowboy boots](cowboy_boot "wikilink")".

### New Zealand

![](Skellerup_Red_Band_rubber_knee_boots.jpg "fig:Skellerup_Red_Band_rubber_knee_boots.jpg")
Red Band rubber knee boots popular in New Zealand\]\] In [New
Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink"), Wellingtons are called "gumboots",
"wellies", or "Redbands" (after a popular
[Skellerup](Skellerup "wikilink") brand), and are considered essential
foot wear for farmers. Gumboots are often referred to in New Zealand
popular culture such as the rurally-based *[Footrot
Flats](Footrot_Flats "wikilink")* comic strip. The farming town of
[Taihape](Taihape "wikilink") in the [North
Island](North_Island "wikilink") proclaims itself "Gumboot capital of
the World" and has annual competitions and events such as [Gumboot
Day](Gumboot_Day "wikilink"), where [gumboots are
thrown](wellie_wanging "wikilink"). Most gumboots are black, but those
worn by [abattoir](abattoir "wikilink") workers, butchers, fishermen and
by hospital operating theatre staff and surgeons are white, and
children's sizes come in multiple colours.

The term "gum boot" in New Zealand is thought to derive from the
19th-century [kauri-gum](kauri_gum "wikilink") diggers, who wore this
footwear, or perhaps because the boots were made from [gum
rubber](gum_rubber "wikilink"). The term is often abbreviated to
"gummies". New Zealand comedy character [Fred
Dagg](Fred_Dagg "wikilink") paid tribute to this iconic footwear in his
song "Gumboots" a modified version of [Billy
Connolly](Billy_Connolly "wikilink")'s "If It Wisnae Fur Yer Wellies".

### Nordic countries

The boots are very popular in Scandinavian countries, with conditions
and climate similar to Canada. In fact, before its entry into the mobile
phone business, rubber boots were among the best-known products of
[Nokia](Nokia "wikilink").[8][9] Both the [Finnish Defence
Forces](Finnish_Defence_Forces "wikilink") and the [Swedish Armed
Forces](Swedish_Armed_Forces "wikilink") issue rubber boots[10] to all
soldiers for use in wet conditions and during the winter with felt
liners.

### Russia

In Russia rubber boots were first introduced in the 1920s. Immediately,
they became extremely popular because of Russian weather conditions.
During the rule of [Joseph Stalin](Joseph_Stalin "wikilink"), 17
rubber-boot factories were built in different parts of the [Soviet
Union](Soviet_Union "wikilink"). Along with
[valenki](valenki "wikilink") in winter, rubber boots became *the*
traditional footwear in springs and autumns.

When [Nikita Khrushchev](Nikita_Khrushchev "wikilink") came to power,
the boot became charged politically in the context of the "Battle for
Modesty" campaign, where rubber footwear was proclaimed as "socialism
style" (thus fashionable), while leather, which was obviously more
expensive, was derided as "capitalism style" (thus unfashionable).
During the period 1961–1964, leather footwear disappeared from Soviet
shops. When [Leonid Brezhnev](Leonid_Brezhnev "wikilink") came to power
in 1964, the usual leather footwear returned to shops, and rubber boots
quickly lost their popularity, returning to their original role of
utility footwear.

Nowadays, Wellington boots in Russia have the same role as in most
countries.

### United Kingdom

Wellington boots are a commonly used form of waterproof footwear in the
UK, and usually referred to as "Wellies". Wellington boots are
particularly popular for small children when they want to jump in
puddles, which is an activity encouraged by the popular children's TV
character [Peppa Pig](Peppa_Pig "wikilink").
