![](Whole-cut_shoe.jpg "fig:Whole-cut_shoe.jpg") In shoemaking,
**wholecut shoes** are shoes which are made from a single piece of
flawless leather with or without a backseamâ€”in the latter case it is
called a *seamless wholecut*.[1][2] These shoes can be entirely plain
and smooth or with tiny perforated decorations. Various types of shoes
can be made wholecut, but usually the term refers to classic dress
shoes. The absence of decorative features and overall conservative look
tend to make wholecuts appropriate for black-tie occasions.[3][4][5]
