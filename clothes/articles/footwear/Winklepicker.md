**Winklepickers**, or **winkle pickers**, are a style of shoe or boot
worn from the 1950s onward by British [rock and
roll](rock_and_roll "wikilink") fans. The feature that gives both the
boot and shoe their name is the very sharp and long pointed toe,
reminiscent of [medieval](medieval "wikilink") footwear and
approximately the same as the long pointed toes on some women's
high-fashion shoes and [boots](Boot "wikilink") in the 2000s.

The extremely pointed toe was called the *winkle picker* because in
England [periwinkle snails](Common_periwinkle "wikilink"), or winkles,
are a popular seaside [snack](snack "wikilink") which is eaten using a
pin or other pointed object to extract the soft parts out of the coiled
[shell](gastropod_shell "wikilink") carefully, hence the phrase: "to
winkle something out", and based on that, *winklepickers* became a
humorous name for shoes with a very pointed tip. Other countries had
other humorous names, e.g. in Norway and Sweden they were called
*myggjagere/myggjagare*, literally "Mosquito hunter". They are still
popular in the [raggare](raggare "wikilink") and
[rockabilly](rockabilly "wikilink") subcultures. In some parts of the
U.S. they are called "roach stompers."

## History

### Origins

Winklepicker shoes, inspired by the [Poulaines](Poulaine "wikilink")
worn by the medieval French nobility,[1] were a conspicuous contrast to
the [brothel creepers](brothel_creeper "wikilink") worn by [Teddy
Boys](Teddy_Boy_(youth_culture) "wikilink"). The male shoes were lace-up
Oxford style with a low heel and an exaggerated pointed toe. A Chelsea
Boot style (elastic-sided with a two-inch, and later as much as
two-and-one-half-inch, [Cuban
heel](High-heeled_footwear#Men_and_heels "wikilink")) was notably worn
by the Beatles but although it had a pointed toe, was not considered to
be a winklepicker. Winklepicker shoes from [Stan's of
Battersea](Stan's_of_Battersea "wikilink") were also worn by the Teddy
Girls as well as being a fleeting fashion for young women generally.

### 1960s

In the early 1960s, the winklepicker toe was popular with modernists,
the forerunners of the mods. In the early 1960s, the point was
effectively chopped off (they hung on for longer than that in the UK)
and gave rise to the "chisel toe" on the footwear of both genders.
However, winklepickers with traditional sharp-point styles made a
comeback of sorts in the late 1970s and early 1980s (either as
previously unworn old-stock, second-hand originals, or
contemporary-production attempted copies) and worn by several subculture
groups including mods, rockabillies, punks, rock'n'roll revivalists, and
in the [goth](Goth_subculture "wikilink") scene, where they are known as
"pikes".[2]

Winklepickers with stiletto heels for women swept the UK in the late
1950s, and at one stage, the High Street versions were commonly worn by
a large part of the adult female populace of the UK. They were often
manufactured in Italy, but the handmade versions, notably those from
Stan's Shoes of Battersea, were the most extreme, if somewhat
bulky-looking at the toe compared with the Italian styles.[3]

The original 1960s winklepicker stilettos were similar to the long,
pointed toe that has been fashionable on women's shoes and boots in
Europe of late. The long, sharp toe was always teamed with a [stiletto
heel](stiletto_heel "wikilink") (or spike heel), which, as today, could
be as low as one-and-a-half inches or as high as five inches, though
most were in the three- to four-inch range. The stiletto heels on the
original 1960s styles were, however, much more curved in at the rear
(also sometimes sharply waisted and slightly flared out at the top
piece) than most of the recent pointy-toed fashion shoes, which often
have straighter, thicker, more set-back heels, rather at odds with the
look of the pointed toe. In most cases, too, the modern shoe toes lack
the length of the true 1960s winklepicker and bear more resemblance to
the less pointed mass-produced versions of the era.[4]

They attained some notoriety, when they first appeared, as a result of
being worn in gang fights (sometimes by both sexes), although there is
some question as to the accuracy of contemporary newspaper accounts. In
fact, although the winklepicker looks lethal, it would be far more
likely for damage to be caused to the delicately pointed shoe than to
the opponent in any serious kicking incident.[5]

### Modern day

By the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, winklepickers
were worn with 1960s [mod](Mod_(subculture) "wikilink") blazers,
[Western shirts](Western_shirt "wikilink"), vintage [T
shirts](T_shirt "wikilink"), and [skinny jeans](skinny_jeans "wikilink")
by many [indie pop](indie_pop "wikilink") bands and musicians, such as
of [Kings of Leon](Kings_of_Leon "wikilink"), [Kaiser
Chiefs](Kaiser_Chiefs "wikilink"), [The Kills](The_Kills "wikilink"),
[The Horrors](The_Horrors "wikilink"), [Jack
White](Jack_White "wikilink"), [Mod Fun](Mod_Fun "wikilink"), [Neils
Children](Neils_Children "wikilink"), [Blanaid
Montague](Blanaid_Montague "wikilink"),
[Klaxons](Klaxons_(English_band) "wikilink"), and [Daniel
Johns](Daniel_Johns "wikilink"). The shoes are closely related to
British [Garage Rock](Garage_Rock "wikilink") band [The
Horrors](The_Horrors "wikilink"),[6] who even went as far as to have a
winklepicker boot with three buckles on their official merchandise
t-shirt along with the words "I am a horror." [Faris
Badwan](Faris_Badwan "wikilink") has personally endorsed [Paolo
Vandini](Paolo_Vandini "wikilink") Veers. They are also worn by English
comedians [Russell Brand](Russell_Brand "wikilink")[7] and [Noel
Fielding](Noel_Fielding "wikilink") and English DJ and TV presenter
[Alex Zane](Alex_Zane "wikilink").

Currently, winklepicker boots are very popular in Germany among the
modern Vogue [Goth](Goth_subculture "wikilink") and [Punk
subcultures](Punk_subculture "wikilink"), who refer to the boots as
"pikes".

Although slightly pointed toes are often a feature of women's fashion
shoes, they are usually nowadays "tamed down" or shortened (often with a
sacrifice of comfortable toe space) for mass market appeal.
