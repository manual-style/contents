**Wrestling shoes** are active wear used in competition and practice for
the sport of [wrestling](amateur_wrestling "wikilink"). Generally light
and flexible, they try to mimic the bare foot, while providing slightly
more traction and ankle support and less chance of contracting a disease
or hurting the opponent with exposed toe nails. As a result, wrestling
shoes tend to have a [high top](high_top "wikilink") design to provide
ankle support and cushioning.

Some powerlifters find wrestling shoes to be useful when lifting because
of how little shock absorption they provide.
