**Wörishofer** is a type of
[orthpaedic](orthopaedic_footwear "wikilink") ladies'
[sandal](sandal "wikilink") made in [Bad
Wörishofen](Bad_Wörishofen "wikilink"). They have a
[cork](Cork_(material) "wikilink") wedge in the sole which is light and
acts as a [shock absorber](shock_absorber "wikilink"). They were first
designed in the 1940s and have been considered practical but ugly. But
in 2010, they became fashionable, being worn by celebrities such as
[Kirsten Dunst](Kirsten_Dunst "wikilink") and [Maggie
Gyllenhaal](Maggie_Gyllenhaal "wikilink").[1] Their effectiveness as a
fashion accessory is due to the confidence with which they are worn —
the wearer is indicating that they are so beautiful that they can
transcend the frumpiness of the shoe. In this, they are similar to other
practical shoes which have been fashionable, including
[Birkenstocks](Birkenstocks "wikilink"), [crocs](crocs "wikilink"), [Dr.
Martens](Dr._Martens "wikilink"), [Dr.
Scholl's](Dr._Scholl's "wikilink") and [Ugg
boots](Ugg_boots "wikilink").[2]

[Podiatrist](Podiatrist "wikilink") Beverley Ashdown rated them 8/10 in
a comparison with other fashionable ugly shoes.[3]
