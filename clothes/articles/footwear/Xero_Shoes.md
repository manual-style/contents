**Xero Shoes** is a type and brand of lightweight minimalist footwear
manufactured by **Feel the World Inc.** Designed for
[walking](walking "wikilink"), [running](minimalist_running "wikilink"),
and athletics, the footwear has thin and flexible soles that are
contoured to the shape of the human foot.[1]

## History

A high-school [sprinter](sprint_(running) "wikilink"), Steven Sashen got
back into the sport after a 30-year break.[2] However, after two years
of injury-prone competition, he joined a local barefoot running club in
Boulder, CO at the suggestion of a friend who gave him a copy of *[Born
To
Run](Born_to_Run:_A_Hidden_Tribe,_Superathletes,_and_the_Greatest_Race_the_World_Has_Never_Seen "wikilink")*
by [Christopher McDougall](Christopher_McDougall "wikilink").[3] As a
result of running barefoot, his [gait](gait "wikilink") changed and
injuries abated.[4]

Sashen wanted to continue the barefoot experience in areas which
required foot covering, so he developed his own [modern
huarache](Huarache_(running_shoe) "wikilink")-style sandal similar to
those worn by the [Tarahumara](Tarahumara "wikilink") Indians in
Mexicoâ€™s Copper Canyon,[5] consisting of a thin rubber sole sourced from
[Vibram](Vibram "wikilink") in [Italy](Italy "wikilink") and
[nylon](nylon "wikilink")-[polypropylene](polypropylene "wikilink")
laces (this original style is now sold as the Xero Shoes "Cherry" in the
classic kit).[6]

After making the first pair for his wife Lena Phoenix and a second for
himself, Sashen got requests from friends for their own minimalist
sandals. Sashen launched a website selling this DIY sandal kit at
invisibleshoe.com in late November, 2009.

In August 2012, the company engaged [Dennis
Driscoll](Dennis_Driscoll "wikilink") who has previously developed
products for [Avia](Avia_(shoes) "wikilink"), [Crocs](Crocs "wikilink"),
[Dr. Martens](Dr._Martens "wikilink"), and [Wilson Sporting
Goods](Wilson_Sporting_Goods "wikilink") as a chief product officer, and
renamed the brand Xero Shoes in December 2012.[7] It has since sold
shoes and sandals in various styles and designs to customers in 94
countries.[8][9]

The company has since moved from online-sales only to also [channel
marketing](Channel_(marketing) "wikilink") via select [high
street](high_street "wikilink") based [North
American](North_American "wikilink") retailers and
[Amazon.com](Amazon.com "wikilink"), priced from $19.95 to $149.99.[10]
