[thumb\|Knee-high ballet boots](/File:Ballet_boots2.jpg "wikilink")

The **ballet boot** is a contemporary style of [fetish
footwear](/shoe_fetishism "wikilink") that merges the look of the
[pointe shoe](/pointe_shoe "wikilink") with a [high
heel](/high-heeled_footwear "wikilink"). The idea is to restrict the
wearer's feet almost *[en pointe](/en_pointe "wikilink")*, like those of
a ballerina, with the aid of long, slender
[heels](/heel_(shoe) "wikilink") ([Dori shoes](/Dori_shoes "wikilink")).
When upright, the feet are held nearly vertical by the shoe, thus
putting nearly all of the body's weight on the tips of the toes.
However, a properly tight fit (firmly laced) will hold the shoe to the
wearer's instep and heel, thereby reducing the weight on the wearer's
toes.

## Construction

The heel height is usually 7 inches (18 centimetres) or more - it is as
long as possible, so that the wearer's foot (ankle and toes) are fully
pointed/extended in the shoe; any longer would prohibit standing or
would require a platform. The boots may rise to any height on the leg.
The [knee-high](/Knee-high_boots "wikilink") and
[thigh-high](/Thigh-high_boots "wikilink") versions may also have
[zippers](/zipper "wikilink") (zips) to allow them to be donned and
doffed more easily. The thigh-high versions may be designed to stop the
leg being bent at the knee, further restricting mobility. There are also
"ballet shoe" designs, including
[sandals](/Sandal_(footwear) "wikilink"),
[mules](/mule_(footwear) "wikilink"), and [Mary
Janes](/Mary_Jane_(shoe) "wikilink"), many of which have buckles.

Some styles are equipped with supports similar to the [toe
box](/toe_box "wikilink") and shank of [pointe
shoes](/pointe_shoes "wikilink"), though, unlike those of the pointe
shoe, the structural design, construction, and integrity provide only
limited mobility.

## History

[Ballerinas](/Ballerina "wikilink") began dancing *en pointe* in the
[Romantic era](/Romantic_era "wikilink"), with the first recorded
performance in 1832 by [Marie Taglioni](/Marie_Taglioni "wikilink"), in
*[La Sylphide](/La_Sylphide "wikilink")*. The soft
[satin](/satin "wikilink") slippers that were used took many decades to
develop into the stiff-tipped pointe shoes that we have come to
recognize in the 20th and 21st centuries, which allow for a greater
range of virtuosic technique. Aside from the ballet *pointe* shoe,
another common ancestor to ballet boots and shoes is a Viennese fetish
boot (circa 1900), which sported a dramatic 11-inch (28-centimetre)
heel; the heel was actually longer than the sole of the shoe, thus
making standing and/or walking impossible. Having grown in popularity
since the 1980s, ballet boots and shoes are now available worldwide and
for online purchase.

## Usage

Ballet boots, unlike shoes, are often used for walking by those with
practice. Despite the perception that ballet boots are only used for
[sexual purposes](/Human_sexual_activity "wikilink"), they have been
shown in pop culture and in the fashion industry. The ballet heels used
for walking are of a much higher quality than those that are used
primarily for fetish wear. Ballet boots of low quality are not intended
for prolonged standing or walking, often they cannot be used for
standing at all, nor are they functional for dancing. Instead, they act
as a fetish object for sexual gratification, heightening the erotic
appeal with the elements of bondage and submission. They are thus
sometimes used in [BDSM](/BDSM "wikilink") play. The boots, however, can
cause enough discomfort by themselves: shortly after they are donned,
the calves often begin to [cramp](/cramp "wikilink") and sting from
overexertion if the wearer is not used to them. Beginners often find
momentary walking and/or standing in them to be difficult and painful,
which may also appeal to [masochists](/Sadomasochism "wikilink").
[Arch](/Arches_of_the_foot "wikilink")-training devices and
[techniques](/Foot_gymnastics "wikilink") are sometimes used to increase
the wearer's instep in order to fit high heels such as these.
