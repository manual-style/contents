A **ballet shoe**, or **ballet slipper**, is a lightweight shoe designed
specifically for ballet dancing. It may be made from soft leather,
canvas, or satin, and has flexible, thin soles. Traditionally, women
wear pink shoes and men wear white or black shoes. Tan colored
slippers—which are unobtrusive and thus give the appearance of dancing
barefoot—are worn in modern ballets and sometimes modern dancing by both
men and women.

All dancers typically wear ballet slippers at the beginning of a ballet
class, whereas female dancers may change into [pointe
shoes](/pointe_shoes "wikilink") for centre work and performance.

Ballet shoes must fit very closely to the foot, for safety and to retain
maximum flexibility.

## Construction

Ballet shoes traditionally have a leather sole which does not reach all
the way to the edges of the shoe. A modern development is the split
sole, which provides greater flexibility and emphasizes the shape of the
foot when pointed. They are usually made from soft leather, canvas or
satin. [Leather](/Leather "wikilink") shoes are long-lasting.
[Canvas](/Canvas "wikilink") shoes are less expensive but wear faster
than average leather ballet shoes. [Satin](/Satin "wikilink") shoes are
often used for performances but can wear out very quickly.

Shoes are secured with the use of [elastic](/Elastomer "wikilink"), most
often with a single band across the arch of the foot, or with two bands
that cross in an "X" shape at the top of the arch. In the case of double
band shoes, some ballet slipper manufacturers will attach one end of
each band to the shoe as part of the production process, and leave it to
the purchaser to attach the free ends of the bands for optimal fit.

## History

Women began to dance ballet in 1682, twenty years after King [Louis XIV
of France](/Louis_XIV_of_France "wikilink") ordered the founding of the
[Royal Academy of
Dance](/Paris_Opera#The_Opera_under_Louis_XIV "wikilink"). At that time,
the standard women's ballet shoe had [heels](/heel_(shoe) "wikilink").
Mid 18th century dancer [Marie Camargo](/Marie_Camargo "wikilink") of
the [Paris Opéra Ballet](/Paris_Opéra_Ballet "wikilink") was the first
to wear a non-heeled shoe. After the [French
Revolution](/French_Revolution "wikilink"), heels were completely
eliminated from standard ballet shoes, as they still are.
