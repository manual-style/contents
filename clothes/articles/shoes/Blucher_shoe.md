[thumb\|230px\|left\|Open lacing with vamp in one piece – the hallmark
of a blucher shoe](/File:Bluecher-Schaftschnitt.jpg "wikilink") A
**blucher** ( or , , **Blücher**) is a style of [shoe](/shoe "wikilink")
with open lacing, its [vamp](/Vamp_(shoe) "wikilink") made of a single
piece of leather ("one cut"), with [shoelace](/shoelace "wikilink")
eyelets tabs sewn on top.[1]

The blucher is similar to a [derby](/Derby_shoe "wikilink"): both
feature open lacing, in contrast to the [Oxford
shoe](/Oxford_shoe "wikilink"), which uses close lacing, but in the
derby the upper has large quarters with eyelets sewn on top, while in
the blucher the upper is made of one cut, with only the small eyelet
tabs sewn on top. In [American English](/American_English "wikilink")
these terms are sometimes confused, with "blucher" also being used to
refer to derby shoes, and "Oxford" also being used to refer to bluchers.

The blucher is named after the 18th century Prussian field marshal
[Gebhard Leberecht von
Blücher](/Gebhard_Leberecht_von_Blücher "wikilink"). General von Blücher
commissioned a boot with side pieces lapped over the front in an effort
to provide his troops with improved footwear. This design was adopted by
armies across Europe.[2]
