**Caulk boots** or **calk boots** Â (also called **cork boots**, **timber
boots**, **logger boots**, **logging boots**, or **corks**) are a form
of rugged footwear that are most often associated with the timber
industry but could be, though rarely are, worn for hiking and in
industries such as manufacturing and construction, owing to their safety
features.

Timber boots are typically made of leather or rubber uppers extending
over the ankle, with a thick rubber sole to provide protection, and
bearing steel spikes for traction.
