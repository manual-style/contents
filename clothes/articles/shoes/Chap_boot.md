[thumb](/file:Rubber_hip_boots.jpg "wikilink") **Chap boots** are a form
of [footwear](/footwear "wikilink"). They are tall
[boots](/boot "wikilink") which cover the whole
[leg](/human_leg "wikilink") up to the [crotch](/crotch "wikilink"),
with a strap attached to the outer side. These straps consist of a loop
of material through which a [belt](/Belt_(clothing) "wikilink") is
threaded to hold the boots up. Thus the boots act similarly to a pair of
[chaps](/chaps "wikilink"). Such boots are often seen as part of [boot
fetishism](/boot_fetishism "wikilink").[1]
