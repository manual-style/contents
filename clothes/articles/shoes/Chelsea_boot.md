**Chelsea boots** are close-fitting, ankle-high boots with an elastic
side panel. They often have a loop or tab of fabric on the back of the
boot, enabling the boot to be pulled on. The boot dates back to the
Victorian era, when it was worn by both men and women.

Chelsea boots and some of its variants were considered an iconic element
of the 1960s in Britain, particularly the
[mod](/Mod_(subculture) "wikilink") scene.

## History

The design is credited to [Queen Victoria](/Queen_Victoria "wikilink")'s
shoemaker J. Sparks-Hall.[1] The shoemaker, J. Sparks-Hall claimed that
"She (Queen Victoria) walks in them daily and thus gives the strongest
proof of the value she attaches to the invention".[2] In his advertising
of the period, he refers to the boot as *J. Sparkes-Hall's Patent
Elastic Ankle Boots*.[3] The boot became popular for horse riding as
well as walking.[4]

[Charles Goodyear](/Charles_Goodyear "wikilink")'s development of
[vulcanised rubber](/Vulcanization "wikilink") enabled the invention of
the elastic gusset boot. The advantage of elasticised boots meant they
could be easily removed and put on again. By the late 1840s, the fashion
began to catch on. This became a prominent style in the West until the
onset of [World War I](/World_War_I "wikilink").[5]

In the 1950s and '60s, Chelsea boots became popular in the UK – and
their association with the [King's Road](/King's_Road "wikilink") (a
street in [Chelsea](/Chelsea,_London "wikilink") and
[Fulham](/Fulham "wikilink") in inner western London) set of [Swinging
London](/Swinging_London "wikilink") – worn by everyone from the
[Rolling Stones](/Rolling_Stones "wikilink") to [Jean
Shrimpton](/Jean_Shrimpton "wikilink") – is believed to explain how the
name "Chelsea" became attached to the boot.[6][7]

### Beatle boots

Theatrical and ballet shoe maker [Anello &
Davide](/Anello_&_Davide "wikilink") created a variant of the Chelsea
boot in 1961 with [Cuban
heels](/High-heeled_footwear#Men_and_heels "wikilink") and pointed toes
for [the Beatles](/the_Beatles "wikilink"), after [John
Lennon](/John_Lennon "wikilink") and [Paul
McCartney](/Paul_McCartney "wikilink") saw some Chelsea boots in its
shop window and commissioned four pairs with higher, Cuban heels – this
style became known as [Beatle boots](/Beatle_boots "wikilink").[8]

Beatle boots, as were Chelsea boots, were frequently adopted by
[mods](/Mod_(subculture) "wikilink") and worn with tailored suits.[9]

### Other variations

Variants and similar boots include a type of [riding
boot](/riding_boot "wikilink") called [jodhpur
boots](/jodhpur_boot "wikilink") as well as assorted work boot designs,
including [Australian work boots](/Australian_work_boots "wikilink")
like those manufactured by [Blundstone](/Blundstone_Footwear "wikilink")
and other companies: such work boots may have [steel
toes](/steel_toe "wikilink").

In Brazil this kind of boot, often rugged and of low-quality, are
associated with the countryside population and construction workers,
being cheap to acquire, popularly known as 'Botinhas Catitó' after one
of its brands.
