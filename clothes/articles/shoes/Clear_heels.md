[thumb\|right\|An example of an Ellie-821, an 8-inch clear
high-heel.](/Image:Ellie821heel.JPG "wikilink") **Clear heels** (also
referred to as **stripper shoes**[1]) are [high-heeled
footwear](/high-heeled_footwear "wikilink") made from a transparent
material.

Heels sometimes contain novelties such as flashing lights, coloured
liquid or even fish. Materials used to create the heel design include
[polycarbonate](/polycarbonate "wikilink"), [PVC](/PVC "wikilink"),
[lucite](/lucite "wikilink") and [acrylic
resin](/acrylic_resin "wikilink").[2][3] The transparency may be used
deceptively with a [ballerina](/ballerina "wikilink") style to give the
appearance of standing on [tiptoe](/tiptoe "wikilink") or *[en
pointe](/en_pointe "wikilink")*.[4]

A more romantic style resembling [Cinderella](/Cinderella "wikilink")'s
[glass slipper](/Cinderella "wikilink") has been designed for social
events such as the [prom](/prom "wikilink") but generally designs are
more provocative with very high heels.[5][6][7][8]

Popular brands include Pleaser and Luscious.[9] In 2009, *New York
Magazine* indicated that the style was "on trend" for the Spring 2010
shows, notably in Milan at [Dsquared2](/Dsquared2 "wikilink"),
[Prada](/Prada "wikilink"),[10] and [Fendi](/Fendi "wikilink").[11][12]
The association between clear heels and erotic performers and
pornography has led to criticism of celebrities for wearing the trend in
public.[13] In an interview actress and singer [Taylor
Momsen](/Taylor_Momsen "wikilink") noted she liked performing in a pair
that had a slot for tips, "fans started putting money in them, so now
they are filled with tons of bills".[14][15]
