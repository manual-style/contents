**Clogs** are a type of [footwear](/footwear "wikilink") made in part or
completely from [wood](/wood "wikilink"). Clogs are used worldwide and
although the form may vary by culture, within a culture the form often
remained unchanged for centuries.

[Traditional](/Tradition "wikilink") clogs remain in use as [protective
footwear](/protective_clothing "wikilink") in
[agriculture](/agriculture "wikilink") and in some
[factories](/factory "wikilink") and [mines](/Mining "wikilink").
Although clogs are sometimes negatively associated with cheap and
folkloric footwear of [farmers](/farmer "wikilink") and the [working
class](/working_class "wikilink"), some types of clogs are considered
[fashion](/fashion "wikilink") wear today, such as Swedish
[träskor](/träskor "wikilink") or Japanese
[geta](/Geta_(footwear) "wikilink").

Clogs are also used in several different styles of
[dance](/clogging "wikilink"). When worn for dancing, an important
feature is the sound of the clog against the floor. This is one of the
fundamental roots of [tap](/tap_dancing "wikilink"), but with the tap
shoes the taps are free to click against each other and produce a
different sound from clogs.

## Types

Ages](/File:Fraumünster_Mittelalter_Spectaculum_2011-05-20_14-37-32.JPG "wikilink")
The Oxford English Dictionary[1] defines a clog as a "thick piece of
wood", and later as a "wooden soled overshoe" and a "shoe with a thick
wooden sole".

Welsh traditional clog maker Trefor Owen identified three main varieties
of clogs: wooden upper, wooden soled and overshoes.

-   Wooden upper clogs; are made by hollowing out a lump of solid wood
    to make a combined upper and lower. Two main variants can be seen:
    -   whole foot clogs; where the wooden upper covers the whole of the
        foot to near the ankle, such as the familiar Dutch
        [klomp](/klomp "wikilink"). They are also known as "wooden
        shoes". Whole foot clogs can give sufficient protection to be
        used as [safety footwear](/safety_boot "wikilink") without
        additional reinforcements.
    -   half open clogs; where the wooden upper extends over the toes or
        slightly further, such as the Italian "zoccolo" or Belgian
        sabots. The upper is similar in outline to a [court
        shoe](/court_shoe "wikilink"). Half open clogs may have
        additional covering or securing straps in some sort of fabric or
        leather.
-   Wooden soled clogs; use wood for the sole only. Wooden soled clogs
    come with a variety of uppers:
    -   complete uppers made from leather or similar material, such as
        [English clogs](/clog_(British) "wikilink"). For more
        protection, they may have steel toecaps and/or steel reinforcing
        inserts in the undersides of the soles
    -   open sandal type fitting. For example, Japanese
        [geta](/Geta_(footwear) "wikilink")
    -   toe peg styles. For example, Indian [paduka](/paduka "wikilink")
-   Overshoes; are wooden soles with straps designed to be worn over
    other footwear for protection, commonly known as
    [pattens](/Patten_(shoe) "wikilink"). Patten style clogs are not
    used anymore. However the derivative
    [galoshes](/galoshes "wikilink") are common worldwide.

These divisions are not fixed: some overshoes look more like whole foot
clogs, like Spanish [albarca](/albarca "wikilink"), whilst other wooden
soled clogs raise and protect clothing in the way that overshoes do,
such as Japanese [geta](/Geta_(footwear) "wikilink").

The type of upper determines how the clogs are worn. Whole foot clogs
need to be close fitting and can be secured by curling the toes. In
contrast wooden soled clogs are fastened by laces or buckles on the welt
and therefore the toes are relaxed as in shoes. Half open clogs may
either be secured like whole foot clogs, or have an additional strap
over the top of the foot. Some sandal types, and in particular toe peg
styles, are worn more like "[flip-flops](/flip-flops "wikilink")" and
rely on the grip between the big and next toe.

## Flexing the foot

Being wood, clogs cannot flex under the ball of the foot as softer shoes
do. To allow the foot to roll forward most clogs have the bottom of the
toe curved up, known as the cast.[2] Some styles of clogs have "feet",
such as Spanish [albarca](/albarca "wikilink"). The clog rotates around
the front edge of the front "feet". Japanese and Indian clogs may have
"teeth" or very high pegs attached to the soles. The clog can rotate
around the front edge of the front "tooth" as the wearer strides
forward. Some medieval pattens were in two pieces, heel through to ball
and ball to toes. Joining the two was a leather strip forming a hinge,
thus allowing the shoe above to flex.[3] Klompen may have a
carefully-placed [ease](/Ease_(sewing) "wikilink") (space left around
the foot), which allows the foot to bend, and the heel to lift within or
out of the clog,

## Origins

The origin of wooden footwear in Europe is not precisely known. De
Boer-Olij reference to the high, thick-soled boots of the
[Greek](/Ancient_Greece "wikilink") tragedy actors in Antiquity (the
[buskin](/buskin "wikilink")) and to the shoes worn by
[Roman](/Roman_empire "wikilink") soldiers (the
[caligae](/caligae "wikilink")).[4] However, there is a possibility that
the [Celtic](/Celts "wikilink") and
[Germanic](/Germanic_peoples "wikilink") peoples from Southern- and
Northern Europe were familiar with some sort of wooden foot covering.
Archaeological finds of these are not known. Wooden footwear often ended
up as firewood and, because of its nature, wood will rot away in the
long run. The oldest surviving wooden footwear in Europe is found in
[Amsterdam](/Amsterdam "wikilink") and
[Rotterdam](/Rotterdam "wikilink"), the
[Netherlands](/Netherlands "wikilink"), and dates from 1230 and 1280.[5]
These finds look very similar to the wooden shoes that are still worn in
The Netherlands.

## Manufacture

Since wooden footwear was a hand-made product, the shape of the
footwear, as well as its production process showed great local and
regional diversity in style. At the beginning of the 20th century
machine-made wooden footwear was introduced. After
[WW2](/WW2 "wikilink"), in particular, wooden shoes disappeared from
sight. They were replaced by more fashionable all-leather and synthetic
footwear. At present, only the so-called Swedish clogs (wooden bottom
and leather top) is still seen as a trendy fashion item, often as
ladies’ high-heeled boots. Nevertheless, traditional wooden footwear is
still popular in several regions in Europe and in some occupations, for
its practical use. Some historic local variations have recently been
replaced by uniform national models.

More information on the various methods of manufacture can be found from
the gallery below.

## Gallery

Presented below are typical clogs from the countries where they are
found. Like many folk items, the boundaries of manufacture and use are
regional and therefore do not always exactly follow those of modern
states. So, in some countries two or more different types can be found.
It is also possible that one type can be found in bordering countries.
For example, Danish, German, Dutch, Belgian and clogs from Northwest
France look quite similar. The links provide access to pages dealing
with the different types of clog, their design, origin and manufacture.

## Fashion clogs

In the 1970s and 1980s, Swedish clogs became popular fashion accessories
for both sexes. They were usually worn without socks and were considered
suitable [attire](/attire "wikilink") for the
*[avant-garde](/avant-garde "wikilink")* man.

In the 1980s and 1990s, clogs based on Swedish clogs returned in fashion
for women. Platform clogs or sandals, often raised as high as 6 or even
8 inches right through between sole and insole, were worn in many
western countries. The large mid layer was often made of solid cork,
although some were merely of plastic with a cork covering. The sole,
more often than not, was made of a light sandy-colored rubber. Some of
the platforms of these clogs were encompassed about with a string-laced
effect.

In 2007, Dutch designers [Viktor & Rolf](/Viktor_&_Rolf "wikilink")
introduced high heeled Dutch clogs on the catwalk, with their winter
collection of 2007/08.[6][7] In 2010, Swedish clogs for women returned
again in [Chanel's](/Chanel "wikilink") and [Louis
Vuitton's](/Louis_Vuitton "wikilink") Spring / Summer 2010
collection.[8]
