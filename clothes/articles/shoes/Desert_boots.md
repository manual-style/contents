A **desert boot** is a chukka boot with crepe rubber soles and,
typically, suede uppers. Desert boots were popularized in the 1950s by
UK shoe company C. & J. Clark.

Desert boots were officially introduced to the world with the debut of
the Clarks' Desert Boot at the 1949 Chicago Shoe Fair. After feature
coverage in *Esquire* magazine, their popularity took-off. According to
Clarks, inspiration came from "the crepe-soled, rough suede boots made
in Cairo's Khan el-Khalili bazaar for British Eighth Army officers."

These boots were based on the South African veldskoen which became a
popular footwear item in Southern Africa due to their robust and simple
design. Often being bought by soldiers for use in the various bush wars
of the region, they have become popular across the world as "desert
boots". [Category:Boots](/Category:Boots "wikilink")
