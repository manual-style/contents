A **duckbill**, **bearpaw** or **cow's mouth** was a style of shoe with
a broad toe which was fashionable in the 15th and 16th centuries. This
style started with [Charles VIII of
France](/Charles_VIII_of_France "wikilink"), who had an [extra
toe](/polydactyly "wikilink"), and was later worn by [Henry VIII of
England](/Henry_VIII_of_England "wikilink"). It replaced the excessively
long toe of the *[poulaine](/poulaine "wikilink")* but also tended to
become impractical as it became enlarged with stuffing and horns and so
could be a foot wide, giving the wearer a waddling gait. It might also
be adorned with slashes to show the fine lining and [sumptuary
laws](/sumptuary_law "wikilink") were introduced to restrict all these
excesses.[1][2]

There is a surviving design for a duckbill shoe by [Albrecht
Dürer](/Albrecht_Dürer "wikilink"); he descibes it as made on an
absolutely straight, symmetric last, and as having an entirely flat sole
of two thicknesses of leather. They were also to have straps over the
instep.[3]
