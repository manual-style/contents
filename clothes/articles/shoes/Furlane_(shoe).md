**Furlane** or **friulane** shoe-slippers, also known as *Gondolier
slippers*, are casual, flat, but sometimes
[high-heeled](/High-heeled_footwear "wikilink") shoes. They usually have
a [velvet](/velvet "wikilink") [fabric](/Textile "wikilink") upper and a
flexible [sole](/Sole_(shoe) "wikilink") made of
[rubber](/rubber "wikilink"). The rubber sole is the defining
characteristic of a pair of furlanes; the
[uppers](/Upper_(shoe) "wikilink") vary widely in style.

## Origin

The furlane shoe was created in the countryside of
[Friuli](/Friuli "wikilink") towards the end of the Second World War.
Inspired from the great tradition of the Republica Serenissima in terms
of fashion, it combined the prestige of Venetian fashion with the spite
of rationing in the context of post-War economic crisis.

As Red Cross nurses gathered the donations of velvet and fabric as well
as old rubber from private donors and small businesses, they were used
to offer simple and practicable jobs to the unoccupied in various
hospitals such as the Military Hospital, the Morelli di Popolo, the
Regina Margherita.[1]

Sold on the [Rialto Bridge](/Rialto_Bridge "wikilink"), they then
appeared at the feet of the [Venetian gondoliers](/Gondola "wikilink"),
who used them not to ruin the wood of the precious gondolas, and it is
said that even the Venetian [nobles](/Nobility_of_Italy "wikilink") wore
them to sneak in silence, thanks to the soft soles, in the night from
their secret lovers.[2]

## Modern furlanes

Since the summer of 2016, the furlane shoes are walking their way into
high fashion.[3] They have often been reshaped into an elegantly
modified, elongated shape that has a smidgen of heel and a softly peaked
toe.

Spotted at the [Venice Biennale](/Venice_Biennale "wikilink"),[4] the
furlane shoes have won appeal for their ethical origins from
eco-friendly recycled materials,[5] simple elegance, and adaptability to
various circumstances.

## Manufacture

The manufacture of furlanes is generally more complex than that of
slippers. The upper part is the most sophisticated part.
