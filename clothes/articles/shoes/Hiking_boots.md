**Hiking (walking) boots** are footwear specifically designed for
protecting the feet and ankles during outdoor walking activities such as
hiking. They are one of the most important items of hiking gear, since
their quality and durability can determine a hiker's ability to walk
long distances without injury. Hiking boots are constructed to provide
comfort for walking considerable distance over rough terrain. Boots that
protect the hiker's feet and heel are recommended. Hiking boots give
ankle support and are fairly stiff. A less popular alternative is to use
light trainers with thin soles.<sup>\[*citation\ needed*\]</sup>
Footwear should be neither too loose nor too tight, to help prevent
blisters and sore feet. Hiking socks that wick sweat from the feet,
provide warmth, and cushion the feet are recommended and a thin, inner
sock may also help. Most hiking boots are also designed for other
outdoor activities such as backpacking, climbing, mountaineering, and
hunting.



## Types

here are three main types of walking footwear.

1.  **Trail shoes** are made for hiking in dry climates, on
    well-established, less rugged or rocky paths. They are suitable for
    many types of day hikes.
2.  **Trail hikers** are for steeper inclines and muddy paths. They are
    used where a lightweight boot is most suitable. Trail hikers are
    also sturdy, higher-cut, and watertight. These boots provide more
    stability and ankle protection against protruding limbs and rocks
    than hiking shoes do.
3.  **Mountain walking or hiking boots** are designed for mountain and
    hill walking, backpacking and mountaineering. Crampons can be
    attached to them for a better grip on glaciers or hard-packed snow.
    They are extremely strong, durable, and have stiff soles to give the
    ankles support and protection on difficult rocky trails.
    Mountaineering boots are usually taller and stiffer than hiking
    boots, providing insulation as well as support and protection.
