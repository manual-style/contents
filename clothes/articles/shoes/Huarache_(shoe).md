huarache.](/Image:Huarache_Izq.PNG "wikilink") **Huaraches** (derived
from *Warachi*, in **[Purépecha](/Purépecha_language "wikilink")**,
indigenous language , singular **huarache**) are a type of
[Mexican](/Mexico "wikilink") [sandal](/sandal_(footwear) "wikilink"),
[Pre-Columbian](/Pre-Columbian "wikilink") in origin.

## History

[right\|thumb\|250px\|Huaraches for sale in

[Pre-Columbian](/Pre-Columbian "wikilink") in origin, the sandals are
believed related to the cactle or cactli, of Náhuatl origin. The name
"Huarache" is derived from the [Purépecha
language](/Purépecha_language "wikilink") term *kwarachi*, and directly
translates into [English](/English_language "wikilink") as sandal.[1]

Early forms have been found in and traced to the countryside farming
communities of [Jalisco](/Jalisco "wikilink"),
[Michoacan](/Michoacan "wikilink"), [Guanajuato](/Guanajuato "wikilink")
and [Yucatan](/Yucatan "wikilink"). Originally of
all-[leather](/leather "wikilink") construction, the thong structure
around the main foot is still traditionally made with hand-woven braided
leather straps.[2]

Huaraches gained popularity in North America thanks to their adoption as
part of the 1960s [hippie](/hippie "wikilink") lifestyle. By the end of
the 20th century they were to be found all over North and [South
America](/South_America "wikilink").

## Styles

Traditional huarache designs vary greatly, but are always very simple.
Originally made of all-leather, later early designs included woven
string soles and occasionally thin wooden soles. Later more elaborate
upper designs were created by saddlers and leather workers.

The modern huarache developed from the adoption in the 1930s of rubber
soles developed from used rubber car-tires. Modern designs vary in style
from a simplistic sandal to a more complex shoe, using both traditional
leather as well as more modern synthetic materials.

Many shoes claim to be huaraches, but they are still traditionally only
considered a huarache if they are handmade, and have a woven-leather
form in the upper.[3]

## Media

Huaraches are mentioned in the lyrics of the [Beach
Boys](/Beach_Boys "wikilink") songs "[Surfin'
U.S.A.](/Surfin'_U.S.A._(song) "wikilink")" and "Noble Surfer"; and in
the novel *[Ask the Dust](/Ask_the_Dust "wikilink")*, written by [John
Fante](/John_Fante "wikilink") (the Camilla Lopez's shoes) also in the
novel *[On the Road](/On_the_Road "wikilink")*, written by [Jack
Kerouac](/Jack_Kerouac "wikilink"). Skeeter Phelan wears a pair of the
shoes, which her traditionalist Southern mother hates, in the [Kathryn
Stockett](/Kathryn_Stockett "wikilink") novel *[The
Help](/The_Help "wikilink")*. Doc Sportello, the detective from [Thomas
Pynchon](/Thomas_Pynchon "wikilink")'s *Inherent Vice*, wears a pair of
huaraches. He eventually loses one shoe and finishes the adventure using
only the other one.
