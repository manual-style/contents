shoes** or **jellies** are shoes made of
[PVC](/Polyvinyl_chloride "wikilink") plastic. Jelly shoes come in a
large variety of brands and colors and the material is frequently
infused with [glitter](/glitter "wikilink"). Its name refers to the
[semi-transparent](/One-way_mirror "wikilink") materials with a
[jelly](/Gelatin "wikilink")-like sheen. The shoes became a
[fad](/fad "wikilink") in the early
[1980s](/1980s_in_fashion "wikilink"), when a pair could frequently be
purchased for less than one US dollar. Like many other fashion trends
from the 1980s, jellies have been revived a number of times since the
late 1990s. Although considered a populist shoe in the 1980s, the jelly
shoe has been reinterpreted by a number of high-end fashion designers in
the early twenty-first century.[1][2]

The exact origins of the jelly shoes are unclear. A frequently offered
explanation is that they were designed by a shoe maker in France after
[World War II](/World_War_II "wikilink"), when there was a leather
shortage in Europe. Another possibility is that the shoes were created
somewhere in the late [1950s](/1945â€“1960_in_fashion "wikilink") or early
[1960s](/1960s_in_fashion "wikilink"), when plastic became a commonplace
material, and fashion designers began to experiment with it. Black and
brown t-bar jellies sandals were popular school wear for boys and girls
in [Australia](/Australia "wikilink") during the 50s and 60s. The
[Brazil](/Brazil "wikilink")-based shoe company Grendene Shoes claims to
have introduced the jelly shoes to the US market in 1982,[3] though a
*[New York Times](/The_New_York_Times "wikilink")* article published on
June 1, 1980 also mentions them.[4]

In 1981, a bank president named Preston Haag Sr. quit his job to look
for a business that would involve his family. He traveled to [South
America](/South_America "wikilink") where he began visiting American
ambassadors to find potential products for the United States. At a
reception in Brazil, Haag noted bright shoes worn by many young women.
He inquired and learned that the manufacturer was
[Grendene](/Grendene "wikilink"), a small company that employed 3,000 of
the 10,000 people living in [Farroupilha](/Farroupilha "wikilink"),
Brazil. In March 1981, Haag struck a deal to distribute Grendene's
plastic shoes in the southeastern US through a new company named
Grendha, which introduced the shoes during the [1982 World's
Fair](/1982_World's_Fair "wikilink"). While successful, according to
Haag the jellies really landed on the map in America in February 1983,
after [Bloomingdale's](/Bloomingdale's "wikilink"), a trendy department
store in [New York City](/New_York_City "wikilink"), ordered 2,400 pairs
in nine styles.[5]

Jelly shoes companies like Holster in [Australia](/Australia "wikilink")
are now adding trending health features and benefits to the shoes as
well. Holster's jelly shoes are recyclable, odor resistant and
non-toxic, which have been distributed to 2,200 retail stores
globally.[6] Jelly shoes are vegan-friendly and offer alternative shoes
that are not made from leather. Brazilian shoe store, Melissa Shoes,
opened locations in [New York City](/New_York_City "wikilink"),
[London](/London "wikilink"), [Spain](/Spain "wikilink") and three
locations in [Florida](/Florida "wikilink") because it experienced a
continuous increase in sales regarding its eco-friendly shoes.[7] Jelly
shoes come in a variety of styles such as flats, heels and wedges. They
are known to be comfortable shoes for the winter, fall and spring
seasons.[8]
