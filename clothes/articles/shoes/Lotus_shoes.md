**Lotus shoes** () are footwear that were worn by women in China who had
[bound feet](/foot_binding "wikilink"). The shoes are cone or
sheath-shaped, intended to resemble a lotus bud.[1] They were delicately
constructed from cotton or silk, and small enough to fit in the palm of
a hand.[2] Some designs had heels or wedge-shaped soles. They were made
in different styles and colors, and were typically ornately decorated,
with embroidered designs of animals or flowers that could continue on
the sole of the shoe.[3] Some designs only fit over the tip of the foot,
giving the illusion of a small bound foot when worn under a long
skirt.[4]

Though foot binding is no longer practiced, many lotus shoes survive as
artifacts in museums or private collections.[5]
