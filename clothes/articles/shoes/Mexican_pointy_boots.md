[thumb\|A red Mexican pointy
boot](/File:Botas_picudas_mexicanas2009.jpg "wikilink")**Mexican pointy
boots** (Spanish: *Botas picudas mexicanas*) or
**[Trival](/Trival "wikilink") boots** (Spanish: *Botas tribaleras*) are
a style of pointed [fashion boots](/fashion_boot "wikilink") made with
elongated toes that are popular footwear for men in parts of
[Mexico](/Mexico "wikilink"). The boots are commonly worn in an ironic
and comedic way by males involved in the [música
Trival](/Trival "wikilink") subculture.

It is said that they originated in the town of
[Monterrey](/Monterrey "wikilink") in the Mexican state of [Nuevo
León](/Nuevo_León "wikilink"). The pointy boots have risen to popularity
at the same time as "[Trance music](/Trance_music "wikilink")" and the
boots have become a preferred footwear for the [all-male
troupes](/Group_dance "wikilink") that dance to the electronic music.

## Origin and expansion

The boots reportedly originated around 2009 in Monterrey in the Mexican
state of Nuevo León, located in North-Central Mexico. Following their
creation, the trend has expanded to parts of the United States where
large numbers of Monterreyen migrants live, particularly in
[Dallas](/Dallas "wikilink"), Texas, but also in
[Tennessee](/Tennessee "wikilink"),
[Mississippi](/Mississippi "wikilink") and
[Oklahoma](/Oklahoma "wikilink").[1][2]

## Design

The pointy boots are made by elongating the toe of normal boots by as
much as , causing the toes to curl up toward the knees. The boots are
then further modified according to the wearer's personal taste.
Alterations incorporate paint and [sequins](/sequins "wikilink") and can
go as far as adding flashing [LED](/LED "wikilink") lights, [disco
balls](/disco_balls "wikilink") and even mirrors.[3][4]

## Dancing

The appearance of the pointy boots has coincided with the popularity of
"[tribal guarachero](/trival "wikilink")" electronic music, hyphy tribal
or tribal. Tribal music has been described as "a mixture of
[Pre-Columbian sounds](/Pre-Columbian "wikilink") mixed with fast
[cumbia](/cumbia "wikilink") bass and [electro
house](/electro_house "wikilink") beats." Boys and men that wear the
pointy boots have formed all-male troupes ([Group
dance](/Group_dance "wikilink") teams) to compete in
[danceoffs](/Competitive_dance "wikilink") at local nightclubs to tribal
music. Participants in the contests spend weeks choreographing their
dance moves and fabricating their outfits which commonly include
"matching western shirts and [skinny jeans](/skinny_jeans "wikilink") to
accentuate their footwear." In Monterrey, prize money ranges from $100
to $500. The prize often includes a bottle of
[whiskey](/whiskey "wikilink").[5][6]

The dance troupes have reportedly become so popular that they are being
hired to entertain "at weddings, for
[quinceañeras](/quinceañeras "wikilink"), celebrations of the Virgin of
Guadalupe and bachelorette parties" and there is even one report of a
crew entertaining after a funeral.[7]
