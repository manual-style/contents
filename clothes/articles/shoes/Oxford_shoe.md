[thumb\|Men's cap toe oxford shoe](/File:Oxford_shoe1.jpg "wikilink") An
**Oxford [shoe](/shoe "wikilink")** is characterized by
[shoelace](/shoelace "wikilink") [eyelets](/eyelets "wikilink") tabs
that are attached under the [vamp](/Shoe#Construction "wikilink"),[1] a
feature termed "closed lacing".[2] This contrasts with
[Derbys](/Derby_shoe "wikilink"), or [bluchers](/bluchers "wikilink"),
which have shoelace eyelets attached to the top of the vamp.[3]
Originally, Oxfords were plain, formal shoes, made of leather, but they
evolved into a range of styles suitable for formal, uniform, or casual
wear. On the basis of function and the dictates of fashion, Oxfords are
now made from a variety of materials, including calf leather, faux and
genuine [patent leather](/patent_leather "wikilink"), suede, and canvas.
They are normally black or brown, and may be plain or patterned
([brogue](/Brogue_shoe "wikilink")).

## Terminology

The meaning of "Oxford" and "Balmoral" may vary geographically. In the
United States, "Balmoral" is often synonymous with "Oxford".[4] In the
[United Kingdom](/United_Kingdom "wikilink"), "Oxford" is sometimes used
for any more formal lace-up shoe, including the
[Blucher](/Blucher_shoe "wikilink") and [Derby](/Derby_shoe "wikilink").
In Britain and other countries, the Balmoral is an Oxford with no seams,
apart from the toe cap seam, descending to the
[welt](/Welt_(shoe) "wikilink"), a style common on
[boots](/boot "wikilink"). Shoes with closed lacing (Oxfords/Balmorals)
are considered more formal than those with open lacing
(Bluchers/Derbys).[5] A particular type of oxford shoe is the wholecut
oxford, its upper made from a single piece of leather with only a single
seam at the back.[6]

## History

[thumb\|Evening Oxford shoes created by Alfred J. Cammeyer in
1891](/File:Evening_oxfords_MET_52.108.8a-b_CP4.jpg "wikilink") Oxfords
first appeared in [Scotland](/Scotland "wikilink") and
[Ireland](/Ireland "wikilink"), where they are occasionally called
**Balmorals** after [Balmoral Castle](/Balmoral_Castle "wikilink").
However, the shoes were later named **Oxfords** after [Oxford
University](/Oxford_University "wikilink"). This shoe style did not
appear in [North America](/North_America "wikilink") until the 1800s.[7]
In the [United States](/United_States "wikilink"), Oxfords are called
**"Bal-type"** as opposed to "[Blucher](/Blucher_shoe "wikilink")-type".
In [France](/France "wikilink"), Oxfords are known as **Richelieu**.[8]

Oxfords were derived from the [Oxonian](/Oxonian_(shoe) "wikilink"), a
half-boot with side slits that gained popularity at [Oxford
University](/Oxford_University "wikilink") in 1800.[9] Unlike early
shoes, Oxfords were cut smaller than the foot. The side slit evolved
into a side lace that eventually moved to the instep, as students
rebelled against knee-high and ankle-high boots. The toe cap can either
be lined with two narrow rows of stitching, perforated holes along the
end cap stitching (quarter-[brogue](/brogue "wikilink")), perforated
holes along the end cap stitching and on the toe cap (semi-brogue), or a
semi-brogue with the classical wingtip design (full-brogue).[10]
