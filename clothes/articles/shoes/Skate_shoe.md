[thumb\|A pair of [Fallen](Fallen_Footwear "wikilink") skate

**skateboard shoes** are a type of footwear specifically designed and
manufactured for use in [skateboarding](/skateboarding "wikilink").[1]
While numerous non-skaters choose to wear skate shoes, the design of the
skate shoe includes many features designed especially for use in
skateboarding, including a vulcanized rubber or
[polyurethane](/polyurethane "wikilink") sole with minimal tread pattern
or no pattern, a [composition leather](/composition_leather "wikilink")
or suede [upper](/Upper_(shoe) "wikilink"), and double or triple
stitching to extend the life of the upper material.[2] A low, padded
tongue is often included for comfort.[3]

## Features

Skate shoe companies have integrated a number of special features into
their shoes. These innovations have a number of functions, including
prevention of "heel bruises" (damage to the heel area of the foot caused
by harsh landings from high distances), enhancement of "skateboard feel"
through increased flexibility, and increased grip action.

These include but are not limited to:

-   Ollie patch (Vision Street Wear/Airwalk - 1980's)
-   Cup soles
-   [Vulcanized rubber](/Vulcanized_rubber "wikilink") soles
-   DURACAP (Vans)
-   Air pockets in the heels
-   Canvas
-   Shoelace protectors
-   Dynamic Grip Technology (DGT) ([DC Shoes](/DC_Shoes "wikilink"))[4]
-   Super Suede (DC Shoes)[5]
-   System G2 Cushioning ([etnies](/etnies "wikilink"),
    [Emerica](/Emerica "wikilink"), éS)
-   STI foam (etnies, Emerica, éS)
-   Lace Loops that "hide" shoelaces
-   Action Leather
-   Thermoplastic [Toe Box](/Toe_Box "wikilink") Reinforcement
-   [EVA](/Ethylene-Vinyl_Acetate "wikilink") Mid Sole[6]

    ([DVS](/DVS_Shoe_Company "wikilink"),[7]
    [Ipath](/Ipath "wikilink")[8] and
    [Supra](/Supra_(brand) "wikilink")[9])

-   Kevlar-reinforced laces (Nike SB)[10]
-   Cold Grip Technology (CGT) (DVS)[11]
-   Lunarlon (Nike SB)[12]

Many features of a skate shoe are designed to increase its durability.
Skate shoes are subjected to the abrasiveness of a skateboard's grip
tape on a regular basis when used for skateboarding. This is why skaters
tend to go through shoes quickly. Super suede, action leather, and
plastic underlying the toe cap help to increase the durability of a
skate shoe. Lace loops and protectors are designed to prevent laces from
shredding by shielding the most common areas that contact with grip
tape.

Other common features include: triple stitching with thicker treads to
prevent ripping, more width so that there is more contact with the board
with thicker tongues and sides to compensate, and deep sole patterns for
grip.
