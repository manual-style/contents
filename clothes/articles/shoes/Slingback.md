A **slingback** is a type of woman's [footwear](/footwear "wikilink")
characterized by a strap that crosses behind the
[heel](/heel "wikilink") or [ankle](/ankle "wikilink").[1][2] A
slingback strap is distinguishable from an
[ankle-strap](/ankle-strap "wikilink") in that the latter is a strap
that completely encircles the ankle.

Slingbacks can be considered a type of [sandal](/sandal "wikilink")[3]
and come in a wide variety of styles from casual to dressy, with heel
height ranging from none to high,[4][5] heel types ranging from as thin
as a [stiletto](/Stiletto_heel "wikilink") to as thick as
[wedges](/Wedge_(footwear) "wikilink") and they may be either closed or
open-toe.[6][7][8][9]

Slingback straps are usually adjustable through a
[buckle](/buckle "wikilink") or an elastic segment, allowing the wearer
to slip their foot into the sandal easily without the need to make
further (or any) manual adjustment to the strap or buckle, while still
holding the foot in the sandal relatively securely. The buckle can be
made of metal, plastic, or even sometimes stone.[10][11]

Classic designs include [Chanel](/Chanel "wikilink")'s two-tone
slingback, introduced in 1957 and relaunched in 2015 by designer [Karl
Lagerfeld](/Karl_Lagerfeld "wikilink").[12][13]
