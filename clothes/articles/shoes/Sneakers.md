**Sneakers** (also called **trainers**, **athletic shoes**, **tennis
shoes**, **gym shoes**, **sport shoes** or **runners**) are
[shoes](/shoe "wikilink") primarily designed for
[sports](/sport "wikilink") or other forms of [physical
exercise](/physical_exercise "wikilink"), but which are now also widely
used for everyday wear.

## Names and etymology

[thumb\|[Reebok](Reebok "wikilink")

The shoes have gone by a variety of names, depending on geography, and
changing over the decades. The term "sneakers" is most commonly used in
the [Northeastern United
States](/Northeastern_United_States "wikilink"), [South
Florida](/South_Florida "wikilink"),[1][2] parts of
[Canada](/Canada "wikilink") and [New Zealand](/New_Zealand "wikilink").
The [British English](/British_English "wikilink") equivalent of
"sneaker" in its modern form is "**trainer**". In some urban areas in
the [United States](/United_States "wikilink"), the slang for sneakers
is **''kicks**''. Other terms include **training shoes** or **trainers**
([Britain](/British_English "wikilink")), **sandshoes**, **gym boots**
or **joggers** ([Geordie English](/Geordie_English "wikilink") in the
[UK](/UK "wikilink")[3] and [Australian
English](/Australian_English "wikilink")), **running shoes**,
**runners** or **gutties** ([Canada](/Canadian_English "wikilink"),
[Australia](/Australian_English "wikilink") and
[Scotland](/Scottish_English "wikilink")), **daps** in
[Wales](/Welsh_English "wikilink"), **runners** in
[Hiberno-English](/Hiberno-English "wikilink"), **sneakers** ([North
America](/North_American_English "wikilink"), [New
Zealand](/New_Zealand_English "wikilink") and
[Australia](/Australian_English "wikilink")), **tennis shoes** ([North
American](/North_American_English "wikilink") and
[Australia](/Australian_English "wikilink")), **gym shoes**,
**tennies**, **sports shoes**, **sneaks**, **takkies** ([South
Africa](/South_African_English "wikilink")[4] and Hiberno-English),
**rubber shoes** ([Philippine English](/Philippine_English "wikilink")),
**canvas shoes** ([Nigeria](/Nigeria "wikilink")) and **sportex**
([Greece](/Greece "wikilink"))

[Plimsolls](/Plimsoll_shoe "wikilink") (British English) are "low tech"
athletic shoes, and are also called 'sneakers' in [American
English](/American_English "wikilink"). The word "sneaker" is often
attributed to American Henry Nelson McKinney who was an advertising
agent for [N. W. Ayer & Son](/N._W._Ayer_&_Son "wikilink"). In 1917, he
used the term because the rubber sole made the shoe's wearer stealthy.
The word was already in use at least as early as 1887, as [*The* *Boston
Journal*](/The_Boston_Journal "wikilink") made reference to "sneakers"
as "the name boys give to tennis shoes." The name "sneakers" originally
referred to how quiet the rubber soles were on the ground, in contrast
to noisy standard hard leather sole dress shoes. Someone wearing
sneakers could "sneak up" on someone while someone wearing standards
could not.[5]

Earlier, the name "sneaks" had been used by prison inmates to refer to
warders because of the rubber-soled shoes they wore.[6]

## History

These shoes acquired the nickname 'plimsoll' in the 1870s, derived
according to Nicholette Jones' book *The Plimsoll Sensation*, from the
coloured horizontal band joining the upper to the sole, which resembled
the [Plimsoll line](/Plimsoll_line "wikilink") on a ship's hull.
Alternatively, just like the Plimsoll line on a ship, if water got above
the line of the rubber sole, the wearer would get wet.[7]

Plimsolls were widely worn by vacationers and also began to be worn by
sportsmen on the [tennis](/tennis "wikilink") and
[croquet](/croquet "wikilink") courts for their comfort. Special soles
with engraved patterns to increase the surface grip of the shoe were
developed, and these were ordered in bulk for the use of the [British
Army](/British_Army "wikilink"). Athletic shoes were increasingly used
for leisure and outdoor activities at the turn of the 20th century -
plimsolls were even found with the ill-fated [Scott Antarctic
expedition](/Terra_Nova_Expedition "wikilink") of 1911. Plimsolls were
commonly worn by pupils in schools' [physical
education](/physical_education "wikilink") lessons in the UK from the
1950s until the early 1970s.

British company [J.W. Foster and Sons](/J.W._Foster_and_Sons "wikilink")
designed and produced the first shoes designed for running in 1895; the
shoes were spiked to allow for greater traction and speed. The company
sold its high-quality handmade running shoes to athletes around the
world, eventually receiving a contract for the manufacture of running
shoes for [the British
team](/Great_Britain_at_the_1924_Summer_Olympics "wikilink") in the 1924
Summer Olympics. [Harold Abrahams](/Harold_Abrahams "wikilink") and
[Eric Liddell](/Eric_Liddell "wikilink") won the 100-m and 400-m events,
kitted out with Foster's running gear.[8]

This style of footwear also became prominent in America at the turn of
the 20th century, where they were called 'sneakers'. In 1892, the [U.S.
Rubber](/U.S._Rubber "wikilink") Company introduced the first
rubber-soled shoes in the country, sparking a surge in demand and
production. The first basketball shoes were designed by
[Spalding](/Spalding_(sports_equipment) "wikilink") as early as 1907.
The market for sneakers grew after [World War
I](/World_War_I "wikilink"), when sports and athletics increasingly
became a way to demonstrate moral fiber and
[patriotism](/patriotism "wikilink"). The U.S. market for sneakers grew
steadily as young boys lined up to buy sneakers endorsed by [football
player](/American_football "wikilink") [Jim
Thorpe](/Jim_Thorpe "wikilink") and [Converse All
Stars](/Chuck_Taylor_All-Stars "wikilink") endorsed by [basketball
player](/basketball_player "wikilink") [Chuck
Taylor](/Chuck_Taylor_(salesman) "wikilink").

During the [interwar period](/interwar_period "wikilink"), athletic
shoes began to be marketed for different sports, and differentiated
designs were made available for men and women. Athletic shoes were used
by competing athletes at the [Olympics](/Olympics "wikilink"), helping
to popularise athletic shoes among the general public. In 1936, a French
brand, Spring Court,[9] marketed the first canvas tennis shoe featuring
signature eight ventilation channels on a vulcanised natural rubber
sole.

[Adolf "Adi" Dassler](/Adolf_Dassler "wikilink") began producing his own
sports shoes in his mother's wash kitchen in
[Herzogenaurach](/Herzogenaurach "wikilink"),
[Bavaria](/Bavaria "wikilink"), after his return from [World War
I](/World_War_I "wikilink"), and went on to establish one of the leading
athletic shoe manufacturers, [Adidas](/Adidas "wikilink").[10] He also
successfully marketed his shoes to athletes at the [1936 Summer
Olympics](/1936_Summer_Olympics "wikilink"), which helped cement his
good reputation. Business boomed and the Dasslers were selling 200,000
pairs of shoes each year before World War II.[11]

### Post-War

During the 1950s, leisure opportunities greatly expanded, and children
and adolescents began to wear sneakers as [school dress
codes](/school_dress_codes "wikilink") relaxed. Sneaker sales rose so
high, they began to adversely affect the sales of conventional
[leather](/leather "wikilink") shoes, leading to a fierce advertising
war for market share in the late '50s. In the 1970s,
[jogging](/jogging "wikilink") for exercise became increasingly popular,
and trainers designed specifically for comfort while jogging sold well.
Companies also started to target some of their products at the casual
fashion market. Soon, shoes were available for football, jogging,
basketball, [running](/running "wikilink"), etc. Many sports had their
relevant shoe, made possible by podiatrist development of athletic shoe
technology.

During the 1990s, shoe companies perfected their fashion and marketing
skills. Sports endorsements with famous athletes grew larger, and
marketing budgets went through the roof. Sneakers became a fashion
statement and were marketed as a definition of identity and personality
rather than simply athletic aids.[12]

From 1970 (5 models) over 1998 (285 models) to 2012 (3,371), the number
of sport shoe models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.[13]

## Use in sports

[thumb\|Road runners [New Balance](New_Balance "wikilink") 750v1 after
marathon event](/File:New_Balance_750v1.jpg "wikilink") The term
'athletic shoes' is typically used for shoes utilized for
[jogging](/jogging "wikilink") or road running and indoor sports such as
[basketball](/basketball "wikilink"), but tends to exclude shoes for
sports played on grass such as [association
football](/association_football "wikilink") and [rugby
football](/rugby_football "wikilink"), which are generally known in
North America as "[cleats](/Cleat_(shoe) "wikilink")" and in British
English as "boots" or "studs".

Attributes of an athletic shoe include a flexible sole, appropriate
tread for the function, and ability to absorb impact. As the industry
and designs have expanded, the term "athletic shoes" is based more on
the design of the bottom of the shoe than the aesthetics of the top of
the shoe. Today's designs include sandals, [Mary
Janes](/Mary_Jane_(shoe) "wikilink"), and even elevated styles suitable
for running, dancing, and jumping.

The shoes themselves are made of flexible compounds, typically featuring
a sole made of dense rubber. While the original design was basic,
manufacturers have since tailored athletic shoes for their specific
purposes. An example of this is the [spiked
shoe](/Track_spikes "wikilink") developed for track running. Some of
these shoes are made up to unusually large sizes for athletes with large
feet.

### Running shoes

Running shoes come in a range of shapes suited to different running
styles/abilities. Generally, they are divided by running style: the
majority are for heel-toe joggers/runners which are further subdivided
into '[neutral](/Pronation_of_the_foot#Neutral_pronation "wikilink")',
'[overpronation](/Pronation_of_the_foot#Overpronation "wikilink")' and
'[underpronation](/Pronation_of_the_foot#Supination "wikilink")'.[14][15]
These are constructed with a complex structure of "rubber" with
plastic/metal stiffeners to restrict foot movement. More advanced
runners tend to wear [flatter and flexible
shoes](/racing_flats "wikilink"), which allow them to run more quickly
with greater comfort.

According to the [NPD Group](/NPD_Group "wikilink"), one in four pairs
of running shoes that were sold in the United States in 2016 were bought
from an [online retailer](/online_retailer "wikilink").[16]

## Sneaker culture

[thumb\|right\|Exhibition *The Rise of Sneaker Culture* at the [Brooklyn
Museum](Brooklyn_Museum "wikilink")](/File:DIG_E_2015._Brooklyn_Museum.The_Rise_of_Sneaker_Culture.jpg "wikilink")

Sneakers have been an important part of [hip hop](/hip_hop "wikilink")
(primarily Pumas, Nike, and Adidas) and [rock 'n
roll](/rock_and_roll "wikilink") (Converse) cultures since the 1970s.
Hip hop artists sign million dollar deals with major brands such as
Nike, Adidas, or Puma to promote their shoes.[17] Sneaker collectors,
called "[sneakerheads](/Sneaker_collecting "wikilink")", regard sneakers
as fashionable items. Sneaker companies encourage this trend by
producing rare sneakers in limited numbers, often at very high retail
prices. Artistically-modified sneakers can sell for upwards of $1000 at
exclusive establishments like Saks Fifth Avenue.[18] In 2005, a
documentary, *[Just for Kicks](/Just_for_Kicks_(2005_film) "wikilink")*,
about the sneaker phenomenon and history was released.[19]
