The **Wellington boot** was originally a type of leather boot adapted
from Hessian boots. They were worn and popularised by Arthur Wellesley,
1st Duke of Wellington. The "Wellington" boot became a staple of
practical foot wear for the British aristocracy and middle class in the
early 19th century. The name was subsequently given to waterproof boots
made of rubber and they are no longer associated with a particular
class. They are now commonly used for a range of agricultural and
outdoors pursuits.

Wellington boots in contemporary usage are waterproof and are most often
made from rubber or polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a halogenated polymer.
They are usually worn when walking on wet or muddy ground, or to protect
the wearer from heavy showers and puddles. They are generally just below
knee-high although shorter boots are available.

The "Wellington" is a common and necessary safety or hygiene shoe in
diverse industrial settings: for heavy industry with an integrated
reinforced toe; protection from mud and grime in mines, from chemical
spills in chemical plants and from water, dirt, and mud in horticultural
and agricultural work; and serving the high standard of hygiene required
in food processing plants, operating theatres, and dust-free clean rooms
for electronics manufacture.

Sailing wear includes short and tall sailing wellingtons with
non-marking, slip-resistant soles to avoid damage to a boat's deck.
These boots require thermal socks to be worn underneath as the rubber
does not provide enough warmth.
