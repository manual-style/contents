![](Islamic_Clothing_Abaya.jpg "fig:Islamic_Clothing_Abaya.jpg") The
**abaya** "cloak" ([colloquially](varieties_of_Arabic "wikilink") and
more commonly, **, especially in [Literary
Arabic](Modern_Standard_Arabic "wikilink"): **; plural **, **),
sometimes also called an *aba*, is a simple, loose
over-[garment](garment "wikilink"), essentially a
[robe](robe "wikilink")-like dress, worn by some women in parts of the
[Muslim world](Muslim_world "wikilink") including in [North
Africa](North_Africa "wikilink") and the [Arabian
Peninsula](Arabian_Peninsula "wikilink").[1] Traditional *abayat* are
black and may be either a large square of fabric draped from the
shoulders or head or a long [kaftan](kaftan "wikilink"). The *abaya*
covers the whole body except the head, feet, and hands. It can be worn
with the *[niqāb](niqāb "wikilink")*, a face veil covering all but the
eyes. Some women also wear long black gloves, so their hands are covered
as well.

The [Indonesian](Women_in_Indonesia "wikilink") and [Malaysian
women's](Women_in_Malaysia "wikilink") traditional dress
[kebaya](kebaya "wikilink") gets its name from the *abaya*.

## Rationale

The rationale for the *abaya* is often attributed to the Quranic quote,
"O Prophet, tell your wives and daughters, and the believing women, to
cover themselves with a loose garment. They will thus be recognised and
no harm will come to them" [Qur'an
33:59](Female_figures_in_the_Quran#Daughters_of_Muhammad "wikilink")[2]
(Translated by [Ahmed Ali](Ahmad_Ali_(writer) "wikilink")) This quote is
often given as the argument for wearing the *abaya*.

The *abaya* is most common in countries with large Muslim populations.
Some denominations of Islam consider the entire female body, except for
the face and hands, [awrah](awrah "wikilink") – that which should be
concealed in public from males unrelated by blood or marriage.

## Countries

Outside some Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, the abaya is not widely
worn by Muslim women. It is rare in countries like
[Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink"), [India](India "wikilink") and
[Pakistan](Pakistan "wikilink"). Abaya also refers to different garments
in different countries. In [Arab states of the Persian
Gulf](Arab_states_of_the_Persian_Gulf "wikilink"), they tend to be black
in color. Turkish abayat, on the other hand, tend to be colorful.

### Saudi Arabia

In [Saudi Arabia](Saudi_Arabia "wikilink"), women are required to cover
in public.[3] Although, In March 2018, the [Crown
Prince](Crown_Prince_of_Saudi_Arabia "wikilink") [Mohammad bin
Salman](Mohammad_bin_Salman "wikilink") claimed that [women could
choose](Women's_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia "wikilink") what to wear in
public, provided it met certain standards, when he stated, "The decision
is entirely left for women to decide what type of decent and respectful
attire she chooses to wear".[4][5]

## Styles

*Abayat* are known by various names but serve the same purpose, which is
to cover. Contemporary models are usually [caftans](caftan "wikilink"),
cut from light, flowing fabrics like
[crepe](crepe_(textile) "wikilink"),
[georgette](Georgette_(fabric) "wikilink"), and
[chiffon](Chiffon_(fabric) "wikilink"). Other known [abaya
styles](https://missabaya.com/blog/abaya-ultimate-guide/) are front open
and front closed abaya. Styles differ from region to region: some
*abayat* have embroidery on black fabric while others are brightly
coloured and have different forms of artwork across them.
