The **aboyne dress** is the name given to the prescribed attire for
female dancers in the [Scottish national
dances](Scottish_highland_dance#Character_and_national_dances "wikilink"),
such as the [Flora MacDonald](Flora_MacDonald "wikilink")'s fancy, the
Scottish lilt, and others. Male dancers wear the [kilt](kilt "wikilink")
for these dances, the kilt being a male garment. There are two versions
of the aboyne dress in use. Some consider the aboyne as quite suited to
the graceful movements of the National dances.[1]

The [Aboyne](Aboyne "wikilink") [Highland
Games](Highland_Games "wikilink"), established in 1867,[2] have
stipulated this style of attire for female dancers since 1952 for both
national and highland dances.[3]

## Description

A typical Aboyne dress consists of a dark [bodice](bodice "wikilink") or
elaborate [waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink"), decorative
[blouse](blouse "wikilink"), full tartan [skirt](skirt "wikilink") and
some times a [petticoat](petticoat "wikilink") and
[apron](apron "wikilink"). Some have a [tartan](tartan "wikilink") sash
(usually draped over the shoulder and coming down towards the hem of the
skirt in the back) rather than an apron.[4] While appearing to be simple
and plain (and poorly assembled), a properly made, modern Aboyne dress
might and can be quite expensive.

In one version, a tartan pattern skirt is worn with an over-the-shoulder
plaid, a white blouse and petticoat, and a velvet bodice. The
alternative is a white dress over a petticoat, together with a tartan
pattern sash.

## History

The name derives from the [Aboyne](Aboyne "wikilink") [Highland
Games](Highland_Games "wikilink")[5] in [Scotland](Scotland "wikilink")
where, in the early 1950s the dance committee under games patron
Lieutenant Colonel John Wilmot Nicol
[DSO](Distinguished_Service_Order "wikilink") of
[Ballogie](Ballogie "wikilink"), dissatisfied with the state of affairs
of female Highland dance attire, prescribed new rules governing
acceptable and better-looking attire for the female dancers.[6] The
problem, as they saw it, was that many felt that the female and male
dancers should not be wearing the same outfits and that a separate style
for women should be developed.[7][8]

About 1949, the committee banned female dancers from wearing the kilt,
sporran or medals. By 1952, they introduced an alternative attire of
white blouse, tartan skirt and long black [stockings](sock "wikilink"),
then for the September 1954 games, a new attire was introduced for all
female dancers (previously it did not apply to girls between six and
eleven).[9] Approved by the [Lord Lyon King of
Arms](Lord_Lyon_King_of_Arms "wikilink"), it was a skirt of light-weight
tartan worn over a white petticoat, with a plaid of the same tartan
material and a tight fitting sleeveless velvet corsage (the upper part
of a woman's dress) over a white blouse. It was designed from the
traditional Scottish woman's dress that was banned after the
introduction of the *[Act of Proscription
1746](Act_of_Proscription_1746 "wikilink")* (England).

The men would continue to dance in traditionally male
[kilt](kilt "wikilink") and jacket, wearing
[bonnets](tam_o'shanter_(hat) "wikilink") and
[sporrans](sporran "wikilink").

The original decision of the Aboyne committee applied to both the
Highland dances and the National dances. The [Scottish Official Board of
Highland
Dancing](Scottish_highland_dance#Scottish_Official_Board_of_Highland_Dancing_(SOBHD) "wikilink")
a few years later modified the dress code so the aboyne dress would be
used by women for just the national dances, and a kilt-based outfit
(without bonnet or sporran) for the Highland dances.[10] To this day,
however, at the Aboyne Highland Games the wearing of the aboyne by women
is strongly 'preferred', except for the [Sailor's
hornpipe](Scottish_highland_dance#Character_dances "wikilink") and
[Irish jig](Irish_jig "wikilink").[11]
