One of the most iconic figures to emerge from 19th century children's
literature, and one who is instantly recognized by her attire, is [Alice
in Wonderland](/Alice_in_Wonderland "wikilink").[1] Although many
artists have depicted Alice in many different ways, the original
illustrations by [John Tenniel](/John_Tenniel "wikilink") have become
iconic through their subsequent repetition (with generally minimal
alterations) in most published editions and film adaptations.
Accordingly, Alice's clothing was the subject of a 2019 monograph.[2]

The headband depicted by Tenniel became so linked to Alice that it gave
rise to the term "[Alice band](/Alice_band "wikilink")".[3][4]

## Tenniel's Alice

Tenniel's black-and-white illustrations for [Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland](/Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland "wikilink") depict Alice
wearing a knee-length [puffed sleeve](/Sleeve "wikilink") dress with a
[pinafore](/pinafore "wikilink") worn over the top and ankle-strap
shoes.[5]

In the analysis of Masafumi Monden,

> Alice’s sense of agency is further conveyed by her dress… Little
> girls’ dresses in mid- to late nineteenth-century Europe were, even
> with certain restrictions, slightly more practical than adults’, and
> the dress Alice wore in Tenniel’s illustrations was a fashion current
> to the time of the book with a faint hint of the practical future ...
> Both the character and dress of Alice thus point out that she is
> neither assertive nor passive but is rather positioned comfortably in
> between the two.

Lewis Carroll gave directions to Tenniel over some aspects of the dress.
Tenniel's first design was intended to give Alice the look of a chess
piece.[6][7][8] However, Caroll instructed Tenniel not to give it "so
much [crinoline](/crinoline "wikilink")",[9][10][11] a common component
of women's dresses at the time. Tenniel also changed the dress from book
to book. In *[Through the Looking
Glass](/Through_the_Looking_Glass "wikilink")*, he gave Alice striped
horizontal [stockings](/stockings "wikilink") and her (now eponymous)
[headband](/headband "wikilink"). For *[The Nursery
"Alice"](/The_Nursery_"Alice" "wikilink")*, he re-drew twenty of the
illustrations, and brought Alice into line with contemporary
fashion.[12] He not only coloured the dress yellow (discussed in detail
later) but added a second bow to Alice's hair, a bow to the apron, and
pleats.

## The colour of Alice's dress

the 1972 film [Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland](Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland "wikilink"). This is an
example of the most well-known depiction of Alice's
dress.\|250px](/Image:Alice_in_Wonderland_dress.jpg "wikilink")

Neither the wording nor illustrations to *Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland* indicated the colour of her clothes.[13] In a popular stage
version of the story, staged by [Henry Saville
Clarke](/Henry_Saville_Clarke "wikilink") in 1886–87, Alice's costume
was white (a decision endorsed for the next production by Lewis
Carroll).

The first colourised versions of Tenniel's images were created for *The
Nursery "Alice"*, coloured under his supervision. In this edition,
Alice's dress was yellow.[14]

Subsequent colourised versions of Tenniel's illustrations created for
editions of the Alice books after [Charles
Dodgson](/Charles_Lutwidge_Dodgson "wikilink")'s death and without the
involvement of Tenniel have dressed Alice in different colours,
including red,[15] orange, and
[chartreuse](/Chartreuse_(color) "wikilink").[16] DeLoss McGraw's
illustrations used a range of colours.

One of the earliest editions,
[Macmillan](/Macmillan_Publishers "wikilink")'s 1903 "Little Folks"
edition, had her in a blue dress.[17] Macmillan's deluxe 1911 edition,
which featured colour plates based on Tenniel's illustrations painted by
artist [Harry Theaker](/Harry_Theaker "wikilink"), again had Alice in a
blue dress.[18] Other illustrators also retained the blue colour scheme,
including [Helen Oxenbury](/Helen_Oxenbury "wikilink").

The blue dress later became the most common and well-known version of
Alice's dress, showing up often in print and filmed adaptations that
take their inspiration from Tenniel's original illustrations (including
Paramount's [1933 movie](/Alice_in_Wonderland_(1933_movie) "wikilink"),
Disney's [1951 movie](/Alice_in_Wonderland_(1951_film) "wikilink"), and
the [1972
movie](/Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland_(1972_film) "wikilink")).
Although some adaptations have chosen different colour schemes (for
example, orange in the [1985 Irwin Allen
production](/Alice_in_Wonderland_(1985_film) "wikilink"), yellow in the
[BBC](/BBC "wikilink")'s
[1972](/Alice_Through_the_Looking_Glass "wikilink")[19] and 1986[20]
adaptations as well as the [1999 Hallmark
movie](/Alice_in_Wonderland_(1999_film) "wikilink") and lilac in [The
Royal Ballet's](/The_Royal_Ballet "wikilink") *[Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland](/Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland_(ballet) "wikilink")*),[21]
the blue version has remained the most iconic version.

## Alice in other media

Journal](Ladies'_Home_Journal "wikilink")

It became fashionable for young girls to dress up as Alice when wearing
fancy dress around the 1880s, by which time the fashion for everyday
girls' dresses had changed enough that Alice's attire as depicted in the
books had come to seem distinctive.

Dresses explicitly inspired by Alice's were a recurrent feature of the
range of the clothes makers Joseph Love, Inc. from the 1930s to the
1960s.[22] The style became especially popular in the USA when the
[Disney movie](/Alice_in_Wonderland_(1951_film) "wikilink") was released
in 1951.[23]

More subtly, Alice's dress has been seen as an influence on Japanese
dress styles, exhibited in music videos by, for example, [Mizuki
Alisa](/Mizuki_Alisa "wikilink") (in the video for her 1991 "Town of
Eden"), [Kawase Tomoko](/Kawase_Tomoko "wikilink") ("Bloomin’!", 2002)
and [Kimura Kae](/Kimura_Kae "wikilink") ("Snowdome", 2007).
