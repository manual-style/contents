## History

### 1850s

[thumb\|218x218px\|Circa
1850.](/File:1850's_Evening_Dress.jpg "wikilink") In previous years, the
same type of dress might have been called an evening dress, having very
similar features; low-cut neckline, a tight bodice, a large skirt and
(sometimes) bare arms.[3] The ball gown at this time had similar
features, a full skirt supported by a
[petticoat](/petticoat "wikilink"), a tight waist achieved by a
[corset](/corset "wikilink") or [bodice](/bodice "wikilink") with a stay
to keep the subject upright and with perfect posture, off the shoulder
style and with bare arms.[4]

In the coming years, the introduction of the sewing machine changed the
dress market. Middle-class people could now produce their own dresses
and with more quality and efficiency than before when they were made by
hand. Upper class members of society might still have had their dresses
made by a designer but with the turn around time decreased.[5] Around
this time was also the introduction of chemical dyes.[6] This
dramatically changed the range of colors that dresses could be produced
in. This time was encompassed within the Romantic period, which
coincided with the Victorian era. During this time the crinoline was
introduced as well as demure sleeves, which puffed up around the arm.[7]

### 1860–1864

Skirts had developed an overall bell shape but with extra fullness at
the back.[8] [thumb\|211x211px\|Circa

### 1865–1867

Skirts lost their front shape and were altered to lay more flat against
the body while the sides and back gained fullness with pleating
techniques. Oftentimes a long train was attached to the back of the
skirt.[9]

### 1868–1878

For the next 10 years the fullness in the back of the skirts increased
further with the use of the [bustle](/bustle "wikilink").[10]

### 1878–1884

The bustle went out of style because it was not needed anymore for the
fullness in the back of the dress. The material instead was gathered and
fell down the back which ended with a long train.[11]

### 1890–1900

The hourglass shape emerged which was known for a narrow waist. It was
achieved by having a cone-shaped skirt that was narrow at the waist and
gained fullness near the bottom.[12] [left\|thumb\|Circa

War II, in 1947, [Christian Dior](/Christian_Dior "wikilink") introduced
his "New Look" of nipped-in waistlines and full skirts.

### 1950s

Previously, ball gowns were worn for private events and parties, but in
the mid-20th century, private events turned into public ones. As the
century progressed, traditional events become less important while ones
like charity events took its place. In 21st century culture, galas and
red carpet events are showcases for extravagant gowns to be in the
public eye. In Britain, when Elizabeth II terminated formal court events
in 1957, the more public events, like a charity ball, arose in
popularity because it was open to anyone who could afford to buy a
ticket.[13]

Designer dresses were typically part of a designer's collection, having
it altered for the wearer. Designers need to know where the dress will
be worn to avoid two people from matching.[14] But if the original
wearer decides to wear the dress to another event afterwards, the
possibility of matching is increased. In modern times, designers must
understand that their pieces of work will be criticized and also praised
as a result of the internet and paparazzi.

## Etiquette

The first forms of the 21st century term “[Debutante
ball](/Debutante_ball "wikilink")” or
“[Cotillion](/Cotillion "wikilink")” emerged in the mid 19th century
with what was called a “coming out ball”. These events were meant to
show off the women who were now of marriageable age. Traditionally the
debutantes will wear all white, but with varying styles of dress.[15]
While the style of dress can vary, strapless and sleeveless variations
are popular and are typically worn with long white gloves and can be
accessorized with bouquets, and sometimes a fan. For most of the 19th
century, a headdress with veiling was a popular style as well as a full
train attached at the waist and in later years it would attach to the
shoulders.

The traditional ideals of the debutante ball vary based on location in
the USA. The debutantes in New Orleans could be seen wearing jeweled
crowns and dresses with Medici collars with elongated trains. Texas has
variations within its various regions. In Laredo, middle class
debutantes wear beaded suede garments. In San Antonio, the dresses are
of elaborate colors and covered in beads of different designs. The beads
add extensive weight having some dresses weigh in at about 75 lbs.[16]

Another coming of age event is the
[Quinceanera](/Quinceanera "wikilink"), an event in Latin American
cultures when a girl turns 15. Their gowns are often very brightly
colored and resemble traditional ball gowns with very full
[ruffled](/ruffle "wikilink") or ruched skirts.[17]

## First Lady's Collection

In 1912, [Helen Taft](/Helen_Taft "wikilink") along with collection
founders Cassie Mason Myers Julian-James, Rose Gouverneur Hoes, and the
Smithsonian Institution started the “First Ladies Collection.” It is
customary for the first lady of the United States to donate the dress
she wears to the inauguration ball but it is not required. Every first
lady is represented in the collection although they are not all
inaugural dresses.[18] Mrs. Taft started this tradition when she donated
her dress that she wore during President Taft's inauguration. Typically
the dresses were added to the collection after the first lady had left
office but in 1955 the publics uproar to see Mamie Eisenhower's
inaugural dress was so strong that the Smithsonian changed their policy
and added her dress immediately, not waiting until she left office.[19]
