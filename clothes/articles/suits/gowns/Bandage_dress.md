A **bandage dress** is a tight-fitting
"[bodycon](/Bodycon_dress "wikilink")" dress that is (or appears to be)
made from multiple thin strips of cloth sewn together, with the
individual strips shaped like [bandages](/bandage "wikilink"). The
bandage dress was made popular by the designer [Hervé
Léger](/Hervé_Léger "wikilink").[1] The material in a bandage dress is
heavier and provides some contouring, a bodycon dress does not provide
this shaping element.
