A **cape dress** describes a woman's dress which combines features of
the [cape](/cape "wikilink") and the [dress](/dress "wikilink"). Either
a cape-like garment is attached to the dress,[1] or otherwise integrated
into its construction, or the dress and cape are made to co-ordinate in
fabric and/or colour.[2] Cape dresses were traditionally worn by
(conservative) [Mennonite](/Mennonite "wikilink") women. Unlike the
prayer (head) covering, the cape dress never became part of dress
regulations.[3] Besides its historical associations with Mennonite
dress, the cape dress has become part of fashion vocabulary.

## The cape dress and Mennonite women

In the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century the cape dress
was worn by women from conservative Mennonite communities.[4] The cape
dress had a plain style and a piece of fabric covered the bodice. This
piece of fabric had a square or V-shape form and de-emphasized the
female form.[5] The women of the Holdeman Mennonite community in
California wore a cape-dress that had a high neckline, loose bodice and
fitted waist. The cape of the dress covered the shoulders and bust.[6]
Because of religious reasons, no (or only minor) adornment of the dress
was allowed.[7] The plainer the dress, the higher it was valued. For
Mennonite community women’s clothing symbolized gender roles.[8] The
dress showed women’s ‘submission to God, to men in general and their
husband in particular’.[9] Besides that it was a statement of
[nonconformity to the world](/nonconformity_to_the_world "wikilink"),
especially against the rapid and dramatically changing fashion from the
end of the nineteenth century onwards.[10]

## The cape dress as a fashionable garment

The cape dress has occurred in different variations in fashion and film.
[Greta Garbo](/Greta_Garbo "wikilink") wore an [Art
Deco](/Art_Deco "wikilink") inspired cape dress in the film *The
Torrent* (1926). The dress has a geometrical black-and-white pattern and
a stiff round ruff.[11] The cape dress was also popular in the 1950s.
Two types were prominent at the time: a full-skirted, sleeveless dress
with a matching, elbow-length cape or a beltless, sheath dress with
matching cape.[12]

In the collection of the [Victoria and Albert
Museum](/Victoria_and_Albert_Museum "wikilink") various cape dresses can
be found. In 1933 [Madeleine Vionnet](/Madeleine_Vionnet "wikilink")
created a woollen jersey dress and matching cape.[13] [Coco
Chanel](/Coco_Chanel "wikilink") designed a dress with matching cape in
1937-8. The dress consisted of silk and net covered with black sequins.
It was lined with satin.[14] In 1967 [Cristóbal
Balenciaga](/Cristóbal_Balenciaga "wikilink") created an evening
ensemble consisting of a matching cape and sleeveless dress out of black
gazar silk.[15] Philippe Venet created a black-and-white dress with a
cape-like collar in 1989.[16]

Recently, the cape dress has occurred in different collections of
fashion designers:

-   [Stéphane Rolland](/Stéphane_Rolland "wikilink") created various
    cape dresses in black, blue and white as part of his Fall 2010
    collection.[17]
-   [Gwyneth Paltrow](/Gwyneth_Paltrow "wikilink") wore a white cape and
    dress by [Tom Ford](/Tom_Ford "wikilink") to the Oscars in 2012.[18]
-   Queen Máxima wore a dress and matching cape by [Jan
    Taminiau](/Jan_Taminiau "wikilink") during the inauguration of King
    Willem-Alexander on 30 April 2013 (Netherlands).[19]
-   January 2014 Lupita Nyong’o wore a red cape dress by [Ralph
    Lauren](/Ralph_Lauren "wikilink") to the Golden Globe Awards[20]
