**Chima jeogori** is a [Korean](Korea "wikilink") term for a women's
outfit consisting of a *[chima](Chima_(clothing) "wikilink")* skirt and
*[jeogori](jeogori "wikilink")* top. Men wear baji jeogori:
*[baji](Baji_(clothing) "wikilink")* (baggy pants) and *jeogori*. It is
not a national costume per se, but a form of
*[hanbok](hanbok "wikilink")*, the traditional Korean form of dress.

## History

At the end of the 19th century, the tongchima (통치마), seamless
one-piece short skirt, came out for convenience. School girls used to
wear a white [jeogori](jeogori "wikilink") and a black tongchima in
modern educational institutions. This fashion gradually faded out in
[South Korea](South_Korea "wikilink") while revived and continues in
[North Korea](North_Korea "wikilink").[1]

In Japan, some ethnic Korean minority schools use a girls' uniform that
is based on tongchima. This form of chima jeogori is modified into white
shirt and shorter ankle length black or blue dress. For the safety of
the children, from April, 1999 most of these schools use the chima
jeogori inside the school and allow students to wear another non-chima
jeogori uniform (the second uniform 第2制服) to go to school and go
home.
