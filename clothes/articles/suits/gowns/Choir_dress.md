[thumb\|Monsignor [Gilles Wach](Gilles_Wach "wikilink") in the blue
choir dress of the ICKSP](/File:Msgr_Wach.jpg "wikilink") **Choir
dress** is the traditional vesture of the [clerics](/cleric "wikilink"),
[seminarians](/seminary "wikilink") and
[religious](/religious_order "wikilink") of [Christian
churches](/Christian_church "wikilink") worn for public prayer and the
administration of the sacraments except when celebrating or
[concelebrating](/Concelebration "wikilink") the
[Eucharist](/Eucharist "wikilink"). It differs from the
[vestments](/vestment "wikilink") worn by the celebrants of the
Eucharist, being normally made of fabrics such as wool, cotton or silk,
as opposed to the fine [brocades](/brocade "wikilink") used in
vestments. It may also be worn by lay assistants such as acolytes and
choirs. It was abandoned by most of the Churches which originated in the
sixteenth-century [Reformation](/Reformation "wikilink").[1]

Like [Eucharistic vestments](/vestments "wikilink") it derived
originally from the formal secular dress of the Roman Empire in the
first centuries of the Christian era which survived in church usage
after fashion had changed.[2]

Choir dress also differs from "house dress" which is worn outside of a
liturgical context (whether in the house or on the street). House dress
may be either formal or informal.

## Roman Catholic choir dress

Choir dress in the [Catholic Church](/Catholic_Church "wikilink") is
worn by deacons, priests, regular prelates, bishops and cardinals when
presiding at or celebrating a [liturgy](/liturgy "wikilink") that is not
the [Mass](/Mass_(liturgy) "wikilink"), especially the [Liturgy of the
Hours](/Liturgy_of_the_Hours "wikilink"). Before the Second Vatican
Council the dress was more elaborate, and had dozens of varieties and
colours. After The Second Vatican Council, it was reduced, however
exceptions are sometimes granted for cathedral chapters.

The current dress is worn when attending Mass without celebrating or
observing the Eucharist. It is worn by seminarians, instituted lectors
and acolytes, and altar servers and choir members at Mass or other
liturgical events.

The basic components of choir dress are:

-   the [cassock](/cassock "wikilink"), with or without
    [fascia](/fascia_(vestment) "wikilink") (fringed sash worn around
    the waist),
-   if the person is a brother or priest in a [religious
    order](/religious_order "wikilink") that has its own
    [habit](/religious_habit "wikilink")
    ([Benedictines](/Benedictines "wikilink"),
    [Franciscans](/Franciscans "wikilink"),
    [Dominicans](/Dominican_Order "wikilink"), etc.), the habit is worn
    in place of the cassock,
-   the [surplice](/surplice "wikilink") (or
    [rochet](/rochet "wikilink") if the wearer is a
    [bishop](/bishop "wikilink"),
    [cardinal](/Cardinal_(Catholicism) "wikilink"), or
    [canon](/canon_(priest) "wikilink")), and
-   the [biretta](/biretta "wikilink") (optional for secular priests
    unless their bishop requires its use, in which case it is
    mandatory).

For [seminarians](/seminarian "wikilink"),
[deacons](/deacon "wikilink"), and [priests](/priest "wikilink") the
cassock is exactly the same as their normal cassock: a black cassock
with black buttons, girded with a black fascia.

Priests who hold additional honors may wear a different cassock:
[Chaplains of His Holiness](/Chaplain_of_His_Holiness "wikilink") wear a
black cassock with purple piping, buttons, and fascia, while [Honorary
Prelates](/Honorary_Prelate "wikilink") and [Protonotaries
apostolic](/Protonotary_apostolic "wikilink") wear a
[purple](/purple "wikilink") cassock with
[scarlet](/Scarlet_(color) "wikilink") piping and buttons with a purple
fascia. A black cassock with [amaranth](/Amaranth_(color) "wikilink")
piping and buttons, girded with a purple fascia, serves as pian dress
(academic dress) for an honorary prelate or protonotary apostolic.
[Canons](/Canon_(priest) "wikilink") may wear the
[rochet](/rochet "wikilink") (if the chapter has been granted usus
rochetti by papal indult) with a distinctive
[mozzetta](/mozzetta "wikilink"), the particular colors of which are
determined by the [chapter](/chapter_(religion) "wikilink").

Bishops wear the above-mentioned purple cassock with scarlet piping, and
add a [pectoral cross](/pectoral_cross "wikilink") suspended from a
[green](/green "wikilink") and [gold](/gold_(color) "wikilink") cord, a
[mozzetta](/mozzetta "wikilink") over the rochet, and a purple
[zucchetto](/zucchetto "wikilink") under the biretta. A
[cardinal](/Cardinal_(Catholicism) "wikilink") wears a
[scarlet](/Scarlet_(color) "wikilink") cassock with scarlet trim,
pectoral cross on a red and gold cord and a red mozzetta over the
rochet, with a red zucchetto. The [Pope](/Pope "wikilink")'s choir dress
includes a white cassock, rochet, red silk mozetta, red brocade stole
and his pectoral cross hangs from a golden cord. Some canons wear their
cross on a ribbon, but only a bishop may wear the cross on a cord. Under
new regulations, neither bishops nor canons wear fur trimmed cappas.

The [cope](/cope "wikilink") and/or
[stole](/Stole_(vestment) "wikilink") may be worn over choir dress when
a cleric presides over a [sacrament](/sacrament "wikilink") (for
instance, at [matrimony](/matrimony "wikilink"), if not celebrated
during Mass), or by the cleric presiding over prayers (for instance, the
priest presiding at a solemn celebration of
[Vespers](/Vespers "wikilink") in the Liturgy of the Hours might wear
cope and stole over choir dress, while other clergy present would wear
simple choir dress of cassock and surplice).

Monks who are neither deacons nor priests also have a form of choir
dress: the full monastic habit with the monastic cowl forms their formal
wear for attending the Liturgy of the Hours or Mass.

Since 2006, priests of the [Institute of Christ the King Sovereign
Priest](/Institute_of_Christ_the_King_Sovereign_Priest "wikilink") have
had their own choir dress, given to them by the Cardinal [Archbishop of
Florence](/Archbishop_of_Florence "wikilink"). Their choir dress
includes a rochet, a mozzetta, the cross of St. [Francis de
Sales](/Francis_de_Sales "wikilink") on a blue and white ribbon, and a
biretta with a blue pom. According to the Institute, "The blue stands
for our complete dedication to the [Blessed
Mother](/Virgin_Mary "wikilink") and is traditionally the color shown on
St. Francis de Sales in most paintings of him," and "The choir dress
expresses the strong unity, spiritually, and identity of the Institute
and adds solemnity to the [liturgy](/Tridentine_Mass "wikilink")."[3]

## Eastern choir dress

priest (in

The choir dress of clergy in the [Eastern
Orthodox](/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "wikilink"), [Oriental
Orthodox](/Oriental_Orthodoxy "wikilink") and [Eastern
Catholic](/Eastern_Catholic_Churches "wikilink") churches are relatively
similar. Over the inner [cassock](/cassock "wikilink") (*rasson* or
*podrasnik*), a deep-sleeved
*[exorason](/cassock#Eastern_practice_(Orthodox) "wikilink")*
(*riassa*), which is often black, is worn. In the [Russian Orthodox
Church](/Russian_Orthodox_Church "wikilink"), married clergy often wear
grey, while monastic clergy wear black. During the
[paschal](/Easter "wikilink") season both monastic and married clergy
will often wear a white inner cassock. Some Russian
[Metropolitans](/Metropolitan_bishop "wikilink") wear a white inner
cassock and a blue outer when formally arriving to celebrate the [Divine
Liturgy](/Divine_Liturgy "wikilink").

### Byzantine Rite

In Eastern Orthodoxy and [Byzantine
Catholicism](/Byzantine_Catholic "wikilink"), [monks](/monk "wikilink")
wear a black cloak, the *[mandyas](/mandyas "wikilink")* over the outer
cassock. The mandyas completely covers the monastic below the chin and
reaches to the floor. In the Greek usage, the mandyas is usually only
worn when performing certain liturgical roles; in the Slavic usage, all
monks and [nuns](/nun "wikilink") of the rank of
[Stavrophore](/Degrees_of_Eastern_Orthodox_monasticism "wikilink") or
above wear the mandyas at every service, so long as they are in their
own [monastery](/monastery "wikilink"). The mandyas of an
[hegumen](/hegumen "wikilink") ([abbot](/abbot "wikilink")) is of black
silk, that of an [archimandrite](/archimandrite "wikilink") or
[bishop](/bishop "wikilink") is of colored silk (specific usages will
differ by jurisdiction), and has four square "tablets" on it: two at the
neck and two at the feet. A bishop's mandyas additionally has "rivers"
on it: three horizontal stripes either of gold (Greek practice) or red
and white (Slavic practice).

Monastic clergy wear different headcoverings than married clergy.
Married clergy wear either a colored
*[kalimaukion](/kamilavka "wikilink")* or
*[skufia](/skufia "wikilink")*; monastic clergy wear a black kalimaukion
and [veil](/Epanokamelavkion "wikilink") (together known as the
*[klobuk](/klobuk "wikilink")*). For monastics, the skufia is reserved
for house dress, and the klobuk is worn in church. Russian
[archbishops](/archbishop "wikilink") have a jewelled cross attached to
the front of their klobuks; Russian Metropolitans wear a white klobuk
with jewelled cross. Several Orthodox
[Patriarchs](/Patriarch "wikilink") wear a rounded headcovering called a
[koukoulion](/koukoulion "wikilink").

[Priests](/Priest "wikilink") who have been awarded a [pectoral
cross](/pectoral_cross "wikilink") wear it with their choir dress (these
pectoral crosses are of several degrees: silver, gold, or jewelled).
Bishops wear a *[panagia](/panagia "wikilink")*
([icon](/icon "wikilink") of the [Theotokos](/Theotokos "wikilink")) in
place of the pectoral cross. Archbishops may wear a pectoral cross and a
panagia. All [primates](/primate_(bishop) "wikilink") and some bishops
below primatial rank have the dignity of wearing an
*[enkolpion](/enkolpion "wikilink")* (icon of Christ), a pectoral cross,
and a panagia.

A ruling Igumen (so long as he is inside his own monastery) and a bishop
may carry his *[paterissa](/paterissa "wikilink")* (crozier) when he is
in church. However, the paterissa is never to be carried inside the
sanctuary; instead, when he goes into the [altar](/altar "wikilink"),
the paterissa is either handed to an [altar
server](/altar_server "wikilink") or left leaning against the
[iconostasis](/iconostasis "wikilink") outside the [Holy
Doors](/Holy_Doors "wikilink").

In North America and Great Britain, some Orthodox clergy have begun to
wear a [Roman collar](/Roman_collar "wikilink") ([clergy
shirt](/clergy_shirt "wikilink")), though this is discouraged among the
more traditional Orthodox.

#### Examples

There exist color and design variations in each
[autocephalous](/autocephalous "wikilink") Church, but these diagrams
give some examples of Eastern Orthodox choir dress vestments:

## Anglican choir dress or choir habit

and pectoral cross.](/Image:Bishop_Trevor_Williams.jpg "wikilink")

*Choir dress* in [Anglicanism](/Anglicanism "wikilink") traditionally
consists of cassock, surplice and scarf (or tippet).[4] An academic hood
may also be worn and, since 1964 in the Church of England a
[cope](/cope "wikilink") may be worn at the discretion of the
minister.[5] However, the basic garment was, and is, the surplice which
by the fourteenth century had become the essential choir-vestment
everywhere.[6] The surplice was the only vesture permitted to the clergy
in the 1552 Prayer Book, except for bishops who should use a
[rochet](/rochet "wikilink") (both wore cassocks as the standard
undergarment).[7] The Elizabethan Prayer Book of 1559 included the
so-called [Ornaments Rubric](/Ornaments_Rubric "wikilink"). Its legal
interpretation was disputed in the nineteenth century[8] it was claimed
that its inclusion in the 1662 [Book of Common
Prayer](/Book_of_Common_Prayer "wikilink") commanded the pre-Reformation
Eucharistic vestments (chasuble, dalmatic, tunicle, alb, amice, and
maniple) that had been in use during the reign of Edward VI.[9] However,
the Elizabethan bishops struggled to enforce the use of the
surplice,[10] and the use of Eucharistic vestments was discontinued
until after the [Oxford Movement](/Oxford_Movement "wikilink"), in the
middle of the nineteenth century, when it was restored in many
cathedrals and parish churches.[11] In many low-church dioceses and
parishes the choir dress continued to be the norm, even at the
Eucharist. The cope nevertheless continued in use for coronations and in
certain cathedrals, but this may be considered an extension of "choir
dress" and was sanctioned by the canons of 1603/4.[12]

The [cassock](/cassock "wikilink") is almost invariably black for
priests and deacons. A traditional Anglican cassock is double-breasted,
being buttoned on the shoulder rather than up the front (there may be a
single button sewn to the center of the chest used to fasten the
academic hood if worn). Many Anglican clergy, especially (though not
exclusively) those within the catholic tradition of Anglicanism, prefer
to wear the Latin single-breasted cassock. The cassock is worn with a
cincture, which may take the form of a cloth sash resembling a
[fascia](/Fascia_(vestment) "wikilink"), or a simple rope girdle or
leather belt. Over this is worn the [surplice](/surplice "wikilink"),
which is longer and fuller than that worn by Roman Catholic clergy,
sometimes reaching well below the knees. Traditionally, an [academic
hood](/academic_hood "wikilink") is worn around the shoulders and down
the back, along with a black [tippet](/tippet "wikilink") or scarf worn
around the nape and hanging straight down in front. The hood and tippet
were once a single garment called an [almuce](/almuce "wikilink"). (The
tippet is not to be confused with the
[stole](/Stole_(vestment) "wikilink"), which is also worn in a similar
manner, but is not part of choir dress, being worn at the Eucharist and
other sacramental services.) Some clergy also wear [Geneva
bands](/Bands_(neckwear) "wikilink") (or "preaching tabs") from their
collars. Though not worn at service-time, the [Canterbury
cap](/Canterbury_cap "wikilink") is the traditional headgear of [Church
of England](/Church_of_England "wikilink") clergy; some prefer the
biretta (see below) or [mortar board](/mortar_board "wikilink"). Neither
is widely worn, although a square cap, with cassock, gown and tippet,
was specified in English [canon law](/canon_law "wikilink") as part of
the "outdoor habit" or "house dress" of the clergy until the
promulgation of new canons in the 1960s.[13] At some periods of history
a black gown, either academic or '[Genevan](/Geneva_gown "wikilink")',
was worn for [Morning](/Morning_Prayer_(Anglican) "wikilink") and
[Evening Prayer](/Evening_Prayer_(Anglican) "wikilink") instead of the
surplice which was reserved for use at the [Holy
Communion](/Holy_Communion "wikilink") - the cassock, bands, gown,
academic hood and tippet still being the normal liturgical costume for
ordained minister of the [Church of
Scotland](/Church_of_Scotland "wikilink") and other
[Reformed](/Reformed "wikilink") and
[Presbyterian](/Presbyterian "wikilink") churches.

Chaplains in the Armed Forces wear tippets with officially sanctioned
badges and any medals they have achieved. A bishop or priest may wear a
tippet with the arms of the [seminary](/seminary "wikilink") from which
he or she received their degree. In England some cathedral clergy wear
tippets on which is embroidered the distinctive symbol or cathedral coat
of arms. Members of the [high church](/high_church "wikilink") or
[Anglo-Catholic](/Anglo-Catholicism "wikilink") parts of the church
sometimes wear choir dress of a more Roman Catholic style, including a
shorter surplice (or *cotta*), a stole (and sometimes a
[biretta](/biretta "wikilink")), excluding hood and tippet.

[Readers](/Reader_(liturgy) "wikilink") when officiating often wear a
blue tippet, or, in the United States, a black tippet displaying the
[arms](/Coat_of_arms "wikilink") of the diocese. At the Eucharist, it
may be more fitting for readers of Scripture to wear street clothing to
emphasize the role of the laity in recent versions of the [Prayer
Book](/Book_of_Common_Prayer "wikilink"). However, in some parishes
readers wear the traditional vestments of the subdeacon at High Mass:
alb fastened with a white cincture and a tunicle. In other parishes they
wear the cassock and surplice, as do members of the choir.

Anglican [bishops](/bishop "wikilink") usually wear a purple cassock.
Over this, instead of the surplice, they wear the
[rochet](/rochet "wikilink") with red or black
[chimere](/chimere "wikilink") and matching cuffs, black tippet, and
sometimes an academic hood.

may also have been used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries for a
type of non-academic hood which extended forward down over the chest.
