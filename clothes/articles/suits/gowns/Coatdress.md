[thumb\|Coatdress](/File:Coatdress.jpg "wikilink") A **coatdress** or
**coat dress** is a woman's dress that resembles an
[overcoat](/overcoat "wikilink"), usually with collar, lapels and front
fastenings similar to a coat, and made in spring- or autumn-weight
fabrics.[1] The modern coatdress first emerged in the 1910s, with a 1915
article in *[Vogue](/Vogue_(magazine) "wikilink")* assuring readers that
the new garment could be worn over waistcoats or underdresses.[2] The
basic coatdress was a wardrobe staple for most decades, but became
particularly popular in the 1960s.[3] In the 1980s and 1990s, [Diana,
Princess of Wales](/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales "wikilink"), was a
particularly high-profile wearer of coatdresses, many designed by
[Catherine
Walker](/Catherine_Walker_(fashion_designer) "wikilink").[4][5] The
coatdress is often recommended for those wishing to project a
professional look,[6] whether in the office,[7] or in the
[courtroom](/courtroom "wikilink").[8]
