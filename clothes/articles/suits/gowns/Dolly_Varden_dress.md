A **Dolly Varden**, in this sense, is a woman's outfit fashionable from
about [1869 to 1875](/1870s_in_fashion "wikilink") in Britain and the
United States. It is named after [a
character](/Dolly_Varden_(character) "wikilink") in [Charles
Dickens](/Charles_Dickens "wikilink"), and the items of clothing
referred to are usually a hat or dress.

## Name

[Dolly Varden](/Dolly_Varden_(character) "wikilink") is a character from
[Charles Dickens](/Charles_Dickens "wikilink")'s 1839 historical novel
*[Barnaby
Rudge](/Barnaby_Rudge:_A_Tale_of_the_Riots_of_'Eighty "wikilink")* set
in 1780. The *Dolly Varden* costume was an 1870s version of [fashions of
the 1770s and 1780s.](/1775–1795_in_fashion "wikilink")

## Fashion

The term "Dolly Varden" in dress is generally understood to mean a
brightly patterned, usually flowered, dress with a
[polonaise](/polonaise_(clothing) "wikilink") overskirt gathered up and
draped over a separate [underskirt](/Petticoat "wikilink").[1] The
overdress is typically made from printed cotton or
[chintz](/chintz "wikilink"), although it can be made from other
materials such as lightweight [wool](/wool "wikilink"), silk and
[muslin](/muslin "wikilink"). An 1869 [fashion
doll](/fashion_doll "wikilink") in the collection of the [V&A Museum of
Childhood](/V&A_Museum_of_Childhood "wikilink") is dressed in the Dolly
Varden mode; unusually the outfit is in dark colours.[2] The [Gallery of
Costume](/Gallery_of_Costume "wikilink") in Manchester holds a more
typical Dolly Varden dress in its collections, made of white linen with
a pink and mauve flowered print.[3]

A Dolly Varden hat, as it relates to the dress, is usually understood to
mean a flat [straw hat](/straw_hat "wikilink") trimmed with flowers and
[ribbons](/ribbons "wikilink"), very like the 18th-century [bergère
hat](/bergère_hat "wikilink"). It is also closely related to the [Pamela
hat](/Pamela_hat "wikilink") or "gipsy hat" that was popular during the
earlier part of the century.[4]

Although the typical Dolly Varden fashion of the large overskirt and
polonaise died out with changes in fashion at the turn of the century,
the names continued to be associated with chintz patterned fabrics and
peplum style dresses. Even in the late 1930s, chintz patterned fashions
might still have the name 'Dolly Varden' attached to them.

## Popular culture

The Dolly Varden fashion [fad](/fad "wikilink") inspired many [popular
songs](/popular_songs "wikilink"), such as [G.W.
Moore](/G.W._Moore "wikilink")'s "Dressed in a Dolly Varden" and [Alfred
Lee](/Alfred_Lee_(songwriter) "wikilink")'s [novelty
song](/novelty_song "wikilink"), "Dolly Varden", (published
[Cleveland](/Cleveland "wikilink"), 1872) which contains the lyrics:

*Have you seen my little girl? She doesn’t wear a bonnet.*
*She’s got a monstrous flip-flop hat with cherry ribbons on it.*
*She dresses in bed furniture just like a flower garden*
*A blowin’ and a growin’ and they call it Dolly Varden.*[5]

In the 1870s, the [Theatre Royal](/Theatre_Royal,_Drury_Lane "wikilink")
in London presented an entertainment called *The Dolly Varden Polka*,
composed by [W.C. Levey](/W.C._Levey "wikilink").[6]

The fashion led to the naming of the [Dolly Varden
trout](/Dolly_Varden_trout "wikilink").[7]

In the second book of the novel *[Alexandria
Quartet](/Alexandria_Quartet "wikilink")* by [Lawrence
Durrell](/Lawrence_Durrell "wikilink"), Scobie, a gay
[Binbashi](/Binbashi "wikilink"), tells the protagonist Darley that when
he cross-dresses he wears a Dolly Varden hat.

One of the most famous uses of the name in theatre was the *Dolly
Varden* [comic opera](/comic_opera "wikilink") which opened in 1902
starring [Lulu Glaser](/Lulu_Glaser "wikilink"). [8] Although the main
character fit the image of the Dickens character, the play itself was
based on *[The Country Wife](/The_Country_Wife "wikilink")* by [William
Wycherley](/William_Wycherley "wikilink").

Another interesting occurrence of the name is in the eponymous
decorative cake, a recipe for which features in the 1980 *[Australian
Women's Weekly Children's Birthday Cake
Book](/Australian_Women's_Weekly_Children's_Birthday_Cake_Book "wikilink")*.
Also known as a 'Princess Cake', the modern Dolly Varden cake uses the
torso of a doll (sometimes called a [doll pick](/doll_pick "wikilink"))
inserted into a conical cake which is then decorated as the doll's
dress. 'Dolly Varden' aluminium cake tins are now broadly available from
cookware retailers for this purpose. The name for the cake no doubt
developed from the Dolly Varden dress. However, in the late 19th
century, the Dolly Varden cake was different. Many recipes call for a
double layered cake with one layer as a lemon or vanilla cake and the
other as a rich spice or fruit cake. Chunks of cherries in the cake were
often used to mimic the chintz of the fashion. [9]
