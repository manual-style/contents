A **dress** (also known as a **[frock](/frock "wikilink")** or a
**[gown](/gown "wikilink")**) is a garment traditionally worn by
[women](/Woman "wikilink") or [girls](/Girl "wikilink") consisting of a
[skirt](/skirt "wikilink") with an attached [bodice](/bodice "wikilink")
(or a matching bodice giving the effect of a one-piece
[garment](/Clothing "wikilink")).[1] It consists of a top piece that
covers the torso and hangs down over the legs. A dress can be any
one-piece garment containing a skirt of any length and can be formal or
casual.

A dress can have sleeves, straps, or be held up with elastic around the
chest, leaving the shoulders bare. Dresses also vary in
[color](/color "wikilink").

The [hemlines](/hemline "wikilink") of dresses vary depending on
[modesty](/modesty "wikilink"), weather, [fashion](/fashion "wikilink")
or the personal taste of the wearer.[2]

## About

Dresses are outer garments made up of a [bodice](/bodice "wikilink") and
a [skirt](/skirt "wikilink") and can be made in one or more pieces.[3]
Dresses are generally suitable for both casual and [formal
wear](/formal_wear "wikilink") in the West for women and girls.

Historically, dresses could also include other items of clothing such as
[corsets](/corset "wikilink"), [kirtles](/kirtle "wikilink"),
[partlets](/partlet "wikilink"), [petticoats](/petticoat "wikilink"),
smocks and [stomachers](/stomacher "wikilink").

## History

### 11th century

In the 11th century, women in [Europe](/Europe "wikilink") wore dresses
that were similar to men's tunics and were loose, with a hemline
reaching to below the knees or lower. By the end of the century, these
dresses featured a tighter fit on the arms and women's upper bodies.
Dresses were made snug by featuring slits on the sides of the dress that
were pulled tight in order to fit a woman's figure.

### 16th century

Starting in the 1550s, middle- and upper-class women in Europe wore
dresses which included a smock, stays, [kirtle](/kirtle "wikilink"),
[gown](/gown "wikilink"), forepart, sleeves, ruff and a
[partlet](/partlet "wikilink"). Undergarments were not worn underneath.
In England, [Queen Elizabeth](/Elizabeth_I_of_England "wikilink")
dictated what kinds of dresses women were allowed to wear. French women
were inspired by Spanish-style [bodices](/bodice "wikilink") and also
wore [ruffs](/Ruff_(clothing) "wikilink"). French dresses were known as
*marlottes*. In Italy, dresses were known as *ropa* and *semarra.*
Dresses in the 16th century also displayed surface decoration such as
[embroidery](/embroidery "wikilink"), with
[blackwork](/blackwork "wikilink") being especially popular.

Women's dresses in [Russia](/Russia "wikilink") during both the 16th and
17th centuries identified a woman's place in society or their family.

### 17th century

[Holland](/Holland "wikilink"), as a center of textile production, was a
particularly noted area of innovation in dress fashion during the 17th
Century. Inn Spain and Portugal, women wore
[stomachers](/stomacher "wikilink") while in England and France, dresses
became more "naturally" shaped. Lace and slashing were popular
decorations. Skirts were full, with regular folds and the overskirt
allowed the display of an underskirt of contrasting fabric. Necklines
became lower as well. Embroidery that reflected scientific discoveries,
such as newly discovered animals and plants were popular. In the
[British Colonies](/British_colonization_of_the_Americas "wikilink"),
multi-piece dresses were also popular, though less luxurious. Wealthy
women living in the Spanish or Dutch colonies in the Americas copied the
fashions that were popular from their homelands.

The three-piece dress, which had a bodice, petticoat and gown, was
popular until the last 25 years of the century, in which the
[mantua](/Mantua_(clothing) "wikilink"), or a one-piece gown, became
more popular. [Corsets](/Corset "wikilink") became more important in
dresses by the 1680s.

Working women, and women in [slavery in the
Americas](/Slavery_in_the_United_States "wikilink"), used simple
patterns to create shifts, wool or linen petticoats and gowns and cotton
dresses. The bottoms of the skirts could be tucked into the waistband
when a woman was near a cooking or heating fire.

### 18th century

[thumb\|400px\|Illustration of 18th century French
women](/File:Lacroix_.jpg "wikilink") Large, triangular silhouettes were
favored during the 18th century, skirts were wide and supported by hoop
underskirts. One-piece gowns remained popular until the middle of the
century. During the 1760s in France, hoop petticoats were reduced in
size. Lighter colors and lighter fabrics were also favored.[4] In
Colonial America, women most often wore a gown and petticoat, in which
the skirt of the gown opened to reveal the
[petticoat](/petticoat "wikilink") underneath.[5] Women also had [riding
habits](/riding_habit "wikilink") which consisted of the petticoat,
jacket and a waistcoat.[6]

French fashion regarding dresses became very fast-changing during the
later part of the 18th century. Throughout this period, the length of
fashionable dresses varied only slightly, between ankle-length and
floor-sweeping.[7] Between 1740 and 1770, the *[robe √† la
fran√ßaise](/Sack-back_gown "wikilink")* was very popular with
upper-class women. In France, the [Empire
style](/Empire_style "wikilink") became popular after the [French
Revolution](/French_Revolution "wikilink").[8] This more simple style
was also favored by [Josephine
Bonaparte](/Empress_Jos√©phine "wikilink"),[9] wife of
[Napoleon](/Napoleon "wikilink"). Other popular styles during the
revolution included tunic dresses and the *neglig√©e √† la patriot,* which
featured the red, white and blue colors of the flag.

### 19th century

[left\|thumb\|[Empire](Empire_silhouette "wikilink") dress, 1800-1805,
cotton and linen, [Metropolitan Museum of
Art](/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art "wikilink") (New York
City)](/File:Dress_MET_69.2.1_front_CP4.jpg "wikilink") Women's dresses
in the 19th century began to be classified by the time of day or purpose
of the dress. High-waisted dresses were popular until around 1830.

Early nineteenth century dresses in Russia were influenced by
[Classicism](/Classicism "wikilink") and were made of thin fabrics, with
some semi-transparent. [Elizabeth Vig√©e Le
Brun](/√âlisabeth_Vig√©e_Le_Brun "wikilink") wore these types of dresses
with a short skirt (reaching to her ankles) when she lived in Russia
between 1785 and 1801 and many Russian women copied her style. By the
1840s, Russian women were turning to what was in fashion in Europe.

Europeans styles in dresses increased dramatically to the
[hoopskirt](/hoopskirt "wikilink") and
[crinoline](/crinoline "wikilink")-supported styles of the 1860s, then
fullness was draped and drawn to the back. Dresses had a "day" bodice
with a high [neckline](/neckline "wikilink") and long sleeves, and an
"evening" bodice with a low neckline
([decollete](/decollete "wikilink")) and very short sleeves. In Russia,
metal hoopskirts were known as "malakhovs." Skirts of the 1860s were
heavily decorated.

To sleep, women in the American West wore floor-length dresses of white
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink") with high collars displaying decoration.
Various [Native
American](/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States "wikilink") people,
such as the [Navajo](/Navajo "wikilink") and the [Mescalero
Apache](/Mescalero "wikilink") began to adapt the designs of their
dresses to look more like the European Americans they came in contact
with. Navajo women further adapted the European designs, incorporating
their own sense of beauty, "creating *h√≥zh√≥."*

Paper [sewing patterns](/Pattern_(sewing) "wikilink") for women to sew
their own dresses started to be readily available in the 1860s, when the
[Butterick Publishing Company](/Butterick_Publishing_Company "wikilink")
began to promote them. These patterns were graded by size, which was a
new innovation.[10]

The [Victorian era's](/Victorian_era "wikilink") dresses were
tight-fitting and decorated with pleats,
[rouching](/Gather_(knitting) "wikilink") and frills.[11] Women in the
United States who were involved in [dress
reform](/Victorian_dress_reform "wikilink") in the 1850s found
themselves the center of attention, both positive and negative.[12] By
1881, the [Rational Dress Society](/Rational_Dress_Society "wikilink")
had formed in reaction to the restrictive dress of the era.[13]

### 20th century

[thumb\|right\|French afternoon dress, circa 1903, cotton and silk,

City)](/File:Afternoon_dress_MET_49.46.17a-b_front_CP4.jpg "wikilink")
In the early twentieth century, the look popularized by the [Gibson
Girl](/Gibson_Girl "wikilink") was fashionable. The upper part of
women's dresses in the [Edwardian era](/Edwardian_era "wikilink")
included a "pigeon breast" look that gave way to a corseted waist and an
s-shaped silhouette. Women called their dresses "waists" if one-piece,
or "[shirtwaists](/Shirtdress "wikilink")," if it consisted of a skirt
and a blouse. The bodice of the dresses had a boned lining. Informally,
wealthy women wore [tea gowns](/tea_gown "wikilink") at home. These
garments were looser, though not as loose as a "wrapper," and made of
expensive fabric and laces.

By 1910, the Edwardian look was replaced with a straighter silhouette.
French designer, [Paul Poiret](/Paul_Poiret "wikilink"), had a huge
impact on the look of the time. Designs developed by Poiret were
available in both boutiques and also in [department
stores](/department_store "wikilink"). Popular dresses of the time were
one-piece and included [lingerie dresses](/lingerie_dress "wikilink")
which could be layered. At around the same time, in the United States,
the [American Ladies Tailors'
Association](/American_Ladies_Tailors'_Association "wikilink") developed
a dress called the [suffragette suit](/suffragette_suit "wikilink"),
which was practical for women to work and move around in.[14][15]
Another innovation of the 1910s was the ready availability of
factory-made clothing.

Waistlines started out high and by 1915 were below the natural waist. By
1920, waistlines were at hip-level. Between 1910 and 1920 necklines were
lower and dresses could be short-sleeved or sleeveless. Women who worked
during [World War I](/World_War_I "wikilink") preferred shorter dresses,
which eventually became the dominant style overall.[16] In addition to
the shorter dresses, waistlines were looser and the dominant colors were
black, white and gray.

By 1920, the "new woman" was a trend that saw lighter fabrics and
dresses that were easier to put on. Younger women were also setting the
trends that older women started to follow. The dresses of the 1920s
could be pulled over the head, were short and straight. It was
acceptable to wear sleeveless dresses during the day.
[Flapper](/Flapper "wikilink") dresses were popular until end of the
decade.

During [World War II](/World_War_II "wikilink"), dresses were slimmer
and inspired by military uniforms.[17] After WWII, the New Look,
promoted by [Christian Dior](/Christian_Dior "wikilink") was very
influential on fashion and the look of women's dresses for about a
decade.

Since the 1970s, no one dress type or length has dominated fashion for
long, with short and ankle-length styles often appearing side-by-side in
fashion magazines and catalogs.[18]

## Use

In most varieties of [formal](/formal_wear "wikilink") [dress
codes](/dress_code_(Western) "wikilink") in Western cultures, a dress of
an appropriate style is mandatory for women. They are also very popular
for special occasions such as [proms](/prom "wikilink") or
[weddings](/wedding "wikilink").[19] For such occasions they, together
with [blouse](/blouse "wikilink") and [skirt](/skirt "wikilink"), remain
the de facto standard attire for many girls and women.

### Basic dress

A **basic dress** is a usually dark-colored dress of simple design which
can be worn with various [accessories](/Fashion_accessory "wikilink") to
suit different occasions.[20] Different kinds of jewelry, belts,
scarves, and jackets can be worn with the basic dress to dress up or
down.[21] A [little black dress](/little_black_dress "wikilink") is an
example of a basic dress.
