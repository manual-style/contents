**Frock** has been used since [Middle
English](Middle_English "wikilink") as the name for an article of
[clothing](clothing "wikilink"), typically
[coat](coat_(clothing) "wikilink")-like, for men and women.

## Terminology

In [British English](British_English "wikilink") and in
[Commonwealth](Commonwealth "wikilink") countries the word may be used
as an alternative term for a girl's or woman's
[dress](dress "wikilink"). In [Australia](Australia "wikilink") it is
frequently used this way, with the phrase "to frock up" meaning to wear
a formal dress or gown for a special occasion.[1]

Relatedly, a [frock coat](frock_coat "wikilink") is a men's
[coat](Coat_(clothing) "wikilink") style of the 19th century,
characterized by full skirts reaching to the lower thigh or knee.
Despite the similarity in the name, the [frock
coat](frock_coat "wikilink") should be regarded as being a distinct
garment quite separate from the frock. In the French language the [frock
coat](frock_coat "wikilink") is called 'une redingote' (from English
"riding coat"), and so unlike the English language implies no immediate
relationship to the frock which is called 'une fraque'. Indeed, the
modern French word for a tail coat is "une frac" which better betrays
the historical relationship between the tail coat and the frock. In
construction the [frock coat](frock_coat "wikilink") could scarcely be
more different from the frock for unlike the latter it is usually double
breasted, lacks any pockets, lacks a high collar, has V-shaped lapels,
is closely fitted and is constructed with a waist seam.

## History

![](Forsterundsohn.jpg "fig:Forsterundsohn.jpg") with his son [Georg
Forster](Georg_Forster "wikilink") (1780) in frocks in
[Tahiti](Tahiti "wikilink"), by [John Francis
Rigaud](John_Francis_Rigaud "wikilink") (1742–1810).\]\] Originally, a
*frock* was a loose, long garment with wide, full
[sleeves](sleeve "wikilink"), such as the
[habit](Religious_clothing "wikilink") of a [monk](monk "wikilink") or
[priest](priest "wikilink"), commonly belted. (This is the origin of the
modern term [defrock](defrock "wikilink") or unfrock, meaning "to eject
from the [priesthood](clergy "wikilink")".)

Throughout the [early modern period](early_modern_period "wikilink"),
"frock" continually applied to various types of clothing, but generally
denoting a loosely fitted garment in practice seeimingly ranging in
styles from resembling a [banyan](Banyan_(clothing) "wikilink") to a
[tunic](tunic "wikilink").

From the 16th century to the early 20th century, *frock* was applied to
a woman's [dress](Dress_(garment) "wikilink") or
[gown](gown "wikilink"), in the fashion of the day, often indicating an
unfitted, comfortable garment for wear in the house, or (later) a light
overdress worn with a [slip](Slip_(clothing) "wikilink") or underdress.

From the 17th century on, a *frock* was a thigh- or full-length loose
outer garment worn by [shepherds](shepherd "wikilink"), workmen, and
farm workers in [Great Britain](Great_Britain "wikilink"), generally of
heavy [linen](linen "wikilink") with a broad flat
[collar](collar_(clothing) "wikilink"), now usually called a
[smock-frock](smock-frock "wikilink"). In some areas, this traditional
frock buttons up the front in the manner of a
[coat](coat_(clothing) "wikilink"), while in others it is a pullover
style.

As such, a *frock* remains a dense knitted overgarment worn by
[sailors](sailor "wikilink") and [fishermen](fisherman "wikilink"), as
*guernsey frock*, *jersey frock* (now usually simply
[guernsey](Guernsey_(clothing) "wikilink") and
[jersey](Jersey_(clothing) "wikilink")).

### 18th century

In 18th century [Britain](United_Kingdom "wikilink") and the [United
States](United_States "wikilink"), a *frock* was an unfitted men's coat
for [hunting](hunting "wikilink") or other country pursuits, with a
broad, flat collar, derived from the traditional working-class frock.

The precise historical evolution of the frock after the second half of
the 18th century is obscure, as is its contrasting features to the
[justaucorps](justaucorps "wikilink"), the evening wear dress coat, and
the supplanting 19th century [frock coat](frock_coat "wikilink").

### 19th century

![](Man's_silk_and_wool_twill_frock_coat_c._1820.jpg "fig:Man's_silk_and_wool_twill_frock_coat_c._1820.jpg"),
[France](France "wikilink") (1816–20), illustrating the shift from
previous 18th century connotations of a frock to early 19th century
definition of a (dark) frock coat. [Los Angeles County Museum of
Art](Los_Angeles_County_Museum_of_Art "wikilink").\]\]

Some late in the 18th century versions had it made with a cutaway front
without a waist seam. This may have been one of the predecessors of the
[frock coat](frock_coat "wikilink") or at least the dress coat with
horizontally cutaway fronts worn for daytime wear by the early 19th
century and from which the modern-day evening wear tail [dress
coat](dress_coat "wikilink") for [white tie](white_tie "wikilink") is
derived. The frock coat in turn became cut away into the modern [morning
coat](morning_coat "wikilink"), giving us the two modern version of
[tail coats](tail_coat "wikilink"), but the evolution is blurry.
Notwithstanding, it seems as if the frock was gradually supplanted by
the frock coat in the early 19th century, whereas the former frock style
was relegated to evening wear.

Shapewise, also the [great coat](great_coat "wikilink") may similarly be
historically derived from the frock as it similarly is single breasted,
with a high and broad collar, waist pockets, and also lacked a waist
seam early in its history as can be seen in an example in the
[Victoria](Victoria_and_Albert_Museum "wikilink") and Albert Museum,
[London](London "wikilink").

## Contemporary feminine connotations

![](Hitomi_(19522048512).jpg "fig:Hitomi_(19522048512).jpg") In
contemporary times, a "frock" may still designate a woman's or girl's,
or child's dress or light overdress.[2][3]
