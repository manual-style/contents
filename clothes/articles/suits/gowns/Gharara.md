([Urdu](Urdu "wikilink"): , [Hindi](Hindi "wikilink"): ग़रारा,
[Bengali](Bangla_language "wikilink"): ঘারারা) is a traditional
[Lucknowi](Lucknow "wikilink") outfit,[1] traditionally worn by
[Muslim](Muslim "wikilink") women of the [Indian
subcontinent](Indian_subcontinent "wikilink"), notably [Hindi
Belt](Hindi_Belt "wikilink") of modern-day [India](India "wikilink").[2]
It consists of a [kurti](kurta "wikilink") (a short, mid-thigh length
tunic), a [dupatta](dupatta "wikilink") (veil), and most importantly, a
pair of wide-legged pants, ruched at the knee so they flare out
dramatically. The knee area, called the *gota* in
[Urdu](Urdu "wikilink"), is often elaborately embroidered in
[zari](zari "wikilink") and [zardozi](zardozi "wikilink") work. Each leg
of a traditional gharara is made from over 12 metres of fabric, often
silk brocade.[3]

Shararas originated in [Awadh](Awadh "wikilink") region of [Uttar
Pradesh](Uttar_Pradesh "wikilink") during the era of the
[Nawabs](Nawab_of_Awadh "wikilink").[4] During the late 19th and early
20th centuries, the gharara was part of the everyday attire among Muslim
women of the Hindi Belt. Ghararas were also made popular in Pakistan and
Bangladesh, in the 1950s and 1960s with popular public figures like
[Fatima Jinnah](Fatima_Jinnah "wikilink") and Begum [Rana Liaquat Ali
Khan](Rana_Liaquat_Ali_Khan "wikilink") wearing them.

Although they are no longer worn as an everyday garment, they remain
popular as wedding attire among Muslim women of the [Hindi
Belt](Hindi_Belt "wikilink") and also among Urdu-speaking immigrants in
[Pakistan](Pakistan "wikilink") and [Bangladesh](Bangladesh "wikilink").
