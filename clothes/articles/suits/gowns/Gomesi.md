A **gomesi** or **busuuti** is a colorful floor-length dress. It is the
[most commonly used costume](most_commonly_used_costume "wikilink") for
women in [Buganda](Buganda "wikilink") and
[Busoga](Busoga "wikilink").[1] Traditional male attire is the
[kanzu](kanzu "wikilink").

## Origins

There are many variations to the origins of the gomesi. One such is that
the gomesi existed long before the missionaries and Indians came to
Uganda, however, the missionaries introduced the use of cotton instead
of the bark cloth, from which the gomesi was originally made. When the
Indians came to Uganda, they added the various fabrics from satin/silk
blends and the vibrant colors to the traditional attire.

According to some scholars, the first gomesi were made for schoolgirls
in Gayaza, Uganda in the 1940s and 1950s. The
[Christian](Christians "wikilink") missionaries who ran the school hired
a Catholic [Goan](Goan "wikilink") tailor to design the dress. The
tailor had the surname of Gomes hence the origin of the name.
Traditional Ugandan clothing was made from
[barkcloth](barkcloth "wikilink"), though early photographic evidence
from the nineteenth century demonstrates the arrival of cotton from the
Sudan and from the East African Coast. The gomesi was originally made
from imported [cotton](cotton "wikilink") fabric, with the aim of
providing a loose garment that covered the breast. The
[Baganda](Baganda "wikilink") were the first nationality to wear the
gomesi. Today the gomesi is the Kiganda traditional dress for women and
is also worn by other ethnicities in Uganda.

## Design

The gomesi is a floor-length, brightly colored cloth dress with a square
neckline and short, puffed sleeves. The dress is tied with a sash placed
below the waist over the hips. The gomesi has two buttons on the left
side of the neckline. Most gomesi are made of [silk](silk "wikilink"),
[cotton](cotton "wikilink"), or [linen](linen "wikilink") fabric, with
silk being the most expensive. A
[kikooyi](East_African_garments "wikilink") or
[kanga](Kanga_(African_garment) "wikilink") is tied underneath the linen
gomesi to ensure that the fabric does not stick to the body. A well-made
Gomesi can require up to six metres of cloth.

The gomesi can be worn for any occasion, and in the rural areas it's the
form of daily dress. Residents of cities and urban areas tend to wear it
on special occasions such as [funerals](funeral "wikilink"), and
[weddings](wedding "wikilink"). The gomesi is worn at
[wedding](wedding "wikilink") ceremonies during the introduction, also
known as the *[Kwanjula](Kwanjula "wikilink")*. During the
[Kwanjula](Kwanjula "wikilink"), all female members of the groom's
family are required to appear dressed in Gomesi.

Singer [Alicia Keys](Alicia_Keys "wikilink") wore the gomesi when she
visited Uganda in 2007.[2]
