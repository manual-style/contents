![](Gymslip.jpg "fig:Gymslip.jpg") A **gymslip** is a sleeveless
[tunic](tunic "wikilink") with a pleated skirt most commonly seen as
part of a [school uniform](school_uniform "wikilink") for girls. The
term "gymslip" primarily refers to the school uniform; otherwise the
term [pinafore dress](pinafore_dress "wikilink") ([British
English](British_English "wikilink")) or [jumper
dress](jumper_dress "wikilink") ([American
English](American_English "wikilink")) is usually preferred.

The introduction of the gymslip as female athletic wear is credited to
Mary Tait, a student of [Martina
Bergman-Österberg](Martina_Bergman-Österberg "wikilink"), a pioneer of
women's [physical education](physical_education "wikilink") in
Britain.[1] Gymslips were worn by [gymnasts](gymnast "wikilink") and
[track and field](track_and_field "wikilink") athlete from the 1880s to
the 1920s, as they were more mobile than traditional female attire, but
still modest enough to keep the underwear hidden during sporting
activity. Even in this modest attire, gymslips as athletic wear were
still worn strictly out of public view.[2][3]

When not worn as athletic wear, gymslips or pinafore dresses are
generally worn over a [blouse](blouse "wikilink") and replace a
[skirt](skirt "wikilink"). A [blazer](blazer "wikilink") may be worn
over the top. First emerging in the 1900s, by the 1920s it had become
compulsory in many private,
[convent](Convent_school#Catholic_tradition "wikilink") and [high
schools](high_school "wikilink"), and thus became commonly worn by girls
as part of their school uniform,[4] together with a
[blouse](blouse "wikilink").[5]

Although now largely replaced by modern-style uniforms, gymslips are
still synonymous in Britain with schoolgirls, leading to the slang term
"gymslip mum" to describe a [teenage
pregnancy](teenage_pregnancy "wikilink").[6] Well-known modern
depictions of gymslips include the [St.
Trinians](St._Trinians "wikilink") films, and less traditionally,
[schoolgirl uniform pornography](Uniform_fetishism "wikilink"), a use
given more public recognition when in 1991 politician [Clare
Short](Clare_Short "wikilink") condemned the fetish, saying *"the [Page
3 girl](Page_Three "wikilink") in a gymslip may be over 16, but the
imagery is clearly intended to present schoolgirls as sexual
objects"*.[7]
