habesha kemis.\]\] The ***habesha kemis*** (ሐበሻ habesha, "Ethiopian" ቀሚስ
kemis, dress) is the traditional attire of
[Habesha](Habesha_people "wikilink") women.[1][2]

The ankle length dress is usually worn by Ethiopian and Eritrean women
at formal events. But it comes in many forms nowadays. It is made of
cotton fabric, and typically comes in white, grey or beige shades. Many
women also wrap a shawl called a *[netela](netela "wikilink")* around
the formal dress.

braids and wearing habesha kemis — a white ankle-length dress with
intricate embroidery — came around to each of us with a silver kettle of
warm water and a silver basin for washing our hands."

kemis is a dress is made from traditionally using cotton and its
generally grouped in the catogery of yahager lebse. Shiny threads called
tilet are woven into the white fabric that creates an elegant effect.
The hem of the dress is quite ornated by the tilet. “It takes about
three weeks for them to make the dress. I had to special order it,”
