A **hospital gown**, also called a **johnny gown**[1] or **johnny**,[2]
is "a long loose piece of clothing worn in a hospital by someone doing
or having an operation".[3] It can be used as clothing for bedridden
patients.[4]

## Utility

[thumb\|120 px\|right\|Hospital gown worn by a
patient.](/File:Hospitalgownspatients.jpg "wikilink") Hospital gowns
worn by patients are designed so that hospital staff can easily access
the part of the patient's body being treated.[5]

The hospital gown is made of [fabric](/Textile "wikilink") that can
withstand repeated laundering in hot water, usually
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink"), and is fastened at the back with [twill
tape](/twill_tape "wikilink") ties. Disposable hospital gowns may be
made of [paper](/paper "wikilink") or thin
[plastic](/plastic "wikilink"), with paper or plastic ties.

Some gowns have snaps along the top of the shoulder and sleeves, so that
the gown can be removed without disrupting [intravenous
lines](/intravenous_line "wikilink") in the patient's arms.

Used paper hospital gowns are associated with hospital infections, which
could be avoided by proper disposal.[6]

A Canadian study surveying patients at five hospitals determined 57
percent could have worn more clothing below the waist, but only 11
percent wore more than a gown. The physicians conducting the survey said
gowns should not be required unless they are necessary. Although they
are cheaper and easier to wash, Dr. Todd Lee, of [Royal Victoria
Hospital](/Royal_Victoria_Hospital,_Montreal "wikilink") in
[Montreal](/Montreal "wikilink"), said gowns are not necessary unless
the patient is [incontinent](/wikt:incontinence "wikilink") or has an
injury in the lower body. Otherwise, Lee said,
[pajamas](/pajamas "wikilink") or regular clothes may be acceptable.[7]

## Alternatives

When 9-year-old Luke Lange complained about wearing a hospital gown when
being treated for [Hodgkin's lymphoma](/Hodgkin's_lymphoma "wikilink"),
his mother adapted some [t-shirts](/t-shirt "wikilink") for him to wear,
using snap tape on the sides. Other children saw the t-shirt and wanted
one too. Two years later, the organization Luke's FastBreaks had raised
$1 million for children's cancer and given out over 5000 of the
t-shirts. They were long enough to wear like the gowns, but some
preferred to wear them like t-shirts. Briton Lynn, executive director of
Luke's FastBreaks, said the t-shirts helped children have a more
positive attitude.[8]

## Design

In November 2006, [Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation](/Robert_Wood_Johnson_Foundation "wikilink") gave a $236,000
grant to a team at [North Carolina State
University](/North_Carolina_State_University "wikilink") to design a new
gown based on "style, cost, durability, comfort, function" and other
qualities. Studies had been done on updating the garment first used when
most patients had to stay in bed, but not designed for modesty when
patients got out of bed.[9] NCSU professor Traci Lamar said, ""Now
doctors want patients up and walking quickly."[10] Still, traditional
gowns could be washed many times and could be handled a lot.[11] Lamar's
team worked to come up with a "more comfortable, less revealing" design.
Surveys found that nurses did not like the ties in the back because
knots could form, and some patients wore more than one gown at once,
with one tied in front and the other in back. Many patients disliked how
lightweight gowns were. In April 2009, the NCSU team showed potential
new designs at a reception, and they were preparing to ask for more
funding as they developed a prototype. Meanwhile, some hospitals were
offering alternatives, including gowns that opened in the front or on
the side, and drawstring pants, cotton tops and boxers. These cost more
than traditional gowns.[12]

In 2009, Fatima Ba-Alawi was honored for her DCS (dignity, comfort,
safety) gown at a [RCN](/Royal_College_of_Nursing "wikilink") conference
on London. Four years after she started using her skills making dresses
to redesign hospital gowns, NHS trusts were using the design. The
reversible gowns have plastic poppers which make it easier to change
without moving the patient and save staff time, and side pockets for
[drips](/Intravenous_therapy "wikilink") or
[catheters](/catheter "wikilink"), along with a pouch for
[cardio](/Cardiology "wikilink") equipment. One version called the Faith
Gown has a detachable [head scarf](/head_scarf "wikilink") and long
sleeves.[13]

Another redesign in England came from [Ben de
Lisi](/Ben_de_Lisi "wikilink"), one of six receiving grants. The Design
Council was scheduled to show his design, which did not open in the back
but did allow access, in March 2010.[14]

The [Cleveland Clinic](/Cleveland_Clinic "wikilink") changed its gowns
in 2010 because the CEO had heard many complaints.[15]
[120px\|right\|thumb\|Patients awaiting surgery with technologist in the

patients feel that hospital gowns are unfashionable, [Diane von
Furstenberg](/Diane_von_Furstenberg "wikilink") was commissioned to
design stylish hospital gowns based on her fashionable [wrap
dress](/wrap_dress "wikilink") by the Cleveland Clinic.[16] The new
design was reversible with a V-neck in both the front and the back, with
softer fabric.[17] [thumb\|left\|120 px\|Iranian surgical technologist

Joel Sherman in his blog "Adolescent Boys and Genital Exams Reducing
Embarrassment" says it is quite common for many teenage boys to be upset
when changing into a hospital gown, especially if the wearer associates
the look of the gown to women's clothing, women's
[nightgowns](/nightgowns "wikilink"), or lingerie.[18]

Lamar's additional funding came from [RocketHub](/RocketHub "wikilink").
At NCSU Fashion Week in 2013, Lamar's design was mentioned as
"functional and dignified," but not shown "to prevent any patent
infringements". A prototype, made of DermaFabric and made at Precision
Fabrics in [Greensboro, North
Carolina](/Greensboro,_North_Carolina "wikilink"), was to be tested at
[WakeMed](/WakeMed "wikilink").[19]

[Birmingham Children's
Hospital](/Birmingham_Children's_Hospital "wikilink") in England
introduced the polyester/cotton Dignity Giving Suit in March 2013, after
18 months of work. Patients and health care professionals liked the
suits with [Velcro](/Velcro "wikilink") fasteners on the seams. Other
area hospitals were interested. Adults wanted the gowns to be made for
them as well as children.[20]

A design patented in 2014 by Janice Fredrickson had a side opening and
sleeve openings, and could be put on without the patient sitting up. One
version had pockets for [telemetry](/biotelemetry "wikilink") wires and
for drainage bags. It was suggested that different colors be used for
different patients, such as those at risk of falling.[21]

In 2015, [Henry Ford Health
System](/Henry_Ford_Health_System "wikilink") of
[Detroit](/Detroit "wikilink") was working on its own design, similar to
a [bathrobe](/bathrobe "wikilink") with [cotton](/cotton "wikilink")
blend. In tests, patients liked the new design. But any update was
likely to cost more, as well as harder to take care of.[22] The Model G
design, to be made by [Carhartt](/Carhartt "wikilink") of Michigan, used
snaps on the front and shoulders.[23]

According to the BBC, in England hospital gowns are made much more
modestly, taking patient dignity into consideration.[24]
