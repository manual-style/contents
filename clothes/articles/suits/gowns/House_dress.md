[thumb\|90px\|Nelly Don house dress, May

dress** is a type of simple dress worn informally at home for household
chores or for quick errands.[1] The term originated in the late
nineteenth century to describe at-home garments designed for maximum
practicality and usually made from washable fabrics. It is directly
descended from the [Mother Hubbard
dress](/Mother_Hubbard_dress "wikilink").[2] Such dresses were a
necessary part of the housewife's wardrobe in the early twentieth
century and could be widely purchased through mail-order catalogues.[3]
The house dress remains a contemporary and frequently worn garments in
some parts of the world.

Although an informal garment, the house dress, particularly during the
1950s, was intended to be stylish and feminine as well as
serviceable.[4] The concept of attractive house dresses was popularised
in the late 1910s by [Nell Donnelly
Reed](/Nell_Donnelly_Reed "wikilink"), whose "Nelly Don" housedresses
(manufactured by The Donnelly Garment Company) established that house
dresses could be both attractive and practical.[5] The company, renamed
[Nelly Don](/Nelly_Don "wikilink") after Reed's retirement, quickly
became one of the most successful American clothing manufacturers of the
20th century.[6] Some designers became known for house dress designs,
such as [Claire McCardell](/Claire_McCardell "wikilink"), whose 1942
'[popover](/popover_(dress) "wikilink")' [wrap
dress](/wrap_dress "wikilink") was equally wearable as a house dress, a
dressing-gown, a beach cover-up or even a party dress.[7] The house
dress version of McCardell's popover came with a matching [oven
glove](/oven_glove "wikilink").[8]

Today house dresses remain in common use in areas where women are
frequently full-time homemakers. It may also be used as an informal term
for a dress that is mainly worn at home or as a leisure garment.
