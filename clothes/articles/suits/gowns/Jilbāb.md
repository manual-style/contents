[thumb\|right\|[Somali](Somalis "wikilink") designer [Muna
Khalif](/Muna_Khalif "wikilink") wearing a modern
jilbāb.](/File:Munaaaa.jpg "wikilink") The term **jilbāb** or
**jilbaab** () refers to any long and loose-fit coat or outer
[garment](/garment "wikilink") worn by some [Muslim](/Muslim "wikilink")
women. Wearers believe that this definition of jilbab fulfills the
[Quranic](/Quran "wikilink") choice for a *[hijab](/hijab "wikilink")*.
*Jilbab*, *jubbah* or *jilaabah* is also known as
*[chador](/chador "wikilink")* by
[Persian](/Persian_Language "wikilink") speakers in
[Iran](/Iran "wikilink"). The modern jilbāb covers the entire body. Some
women will also cover the hands with gloves and the face along with a
[niqāb](/niqāb "wikilink"). In recent years, a short visor is often
included to protect the face from the tropical sun.

## Qur'an and hadith

The plural of jilbāb, jalabib, is found in the
[Qur'an](/Qur'an "wikilink"), verse 33:59 (Surah
[Al-Ahzab](/Al-Ahzab "wikilink")). A popular translation by [Yusuf
Ali](/Abdullah_Yusuf_Ali "wikilink") goes of the transliterated Arabic
goes,

> *Ya ayyuha an-Nabiyy qul li azwajika wa banatika wa nisa al-mu'minin
> yudnina alayhinna min*jalabib*hinna; dhalika adna an yu'rafna fa laa
> yu'dhayn. Wa kana Allahu Ghafur Rahim*

> O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women, that
> they should cast their \[*jalabib*\] *(Jilbabs)* over their persons
> (when abroad): that is most convenient, that they should be known (as
> such) and not molested. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

This is the following from the Quran which explains how a Muslim woman
must act and dress:

> "Tell the believing men that they shall subdue their eyes (and not
> stare at the women), and to maintain their chastity. This is purer for
> them. God is fully Cognizant of everything they do. And tell the
> believing women to subdue their eyes, and maintain their chastity.
> They shall not reveal any parts of their bodies, except that which is
> necessary. They shall cover their chests, and shall not relax this
> code in the presence of other than their husbands, their fathers, the
> fathers of their husbands, their sons, the sons of their husbands,
> their brothers, the sons of their brothers, the sons of their sisters,
> other women, the male servants or employees whose sexual drive has
> been nullified, or the children who have not reached puberty. They
> shall not strike their feet when they walk in order to shake and
> reveal certain details of their bodies. All of you shall repent to
> GOD, O you believers, that you may succeed." (Quran 24:30-31)

A number of [hadith](/hadith "wikilink") commenting on the above verse
of the Qur'an (33:59) mention the jilbab.

> Narrated Safiyah bint Shaibah: '[Aisha](/Aisha "wikilink") used to
> say: "When (the Verse): "They should draw their *jalabib* over their
> necks and bosoms," was revealed, (the ladies) cut their waist sheets
> at the edges and covered their faces with the cut pieces." (Sahih
> Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Number #282)

> Narrated Umm Atiyya: We were ordered to bring out our menstruating
> women and screened women to the religious gatherings and invocation of
> the Muslims on the two Eid festivals. These menstruating women were to
> keep away from the musalla. A woman asked, "O Messenger of Allah! What
> about one who does not have a *jilbab*?". He said, "Let her borrow the
> *jilbab* of her companion". (Sahih Bukhari, Book 8, #347)

## Overview

[thumb\|Women wearing the traditional jilbāb in the [Medina
quarter](Medina_quarter "wikilink") in
[Essaouira](/Essaouira "wikilink"),
[Morocco](/Morocco "wikilink").](/File:Essaouira001.jpg "wikilink")
Since there are no pictures of 7th century jilbab, nor any surviving
garments, it is not at all clear if the modern jilbab is the same
garment as that referred to in the [Qur'an](/Qur'an "wikilink"). In
general terms, jilbab is a garment/sheet that is worn on the head,
draped around the body and that totally covers the body of the woman.

Some modern Muslims insist that the contemporary jilbab and the garment
described in the Qur'an and the hadith are exactly the same, and that
the Qur'an therefore requires the believer to wear 'these' garments.
Some scholars say that a veil is not compulsory in front of
[blind](/blindness "wikilink"), [asexual](/asexuality "wikilink") or
[gay men](/male_homosexuality "wikilink").[1][2][3]

> The Encyclopedia of Islam identifies over a hundred terms for dress
> parts, many of which are used for "veiling" (Encyclopedia of Islam
> 1986: 745–6).
>
> Some of these and related Arabic terms are burqu, ‘abayah, tarhah,
> bumus, jilbab, jellabah, hayik, milayah, gallabiyyah, dishdasha,
> gargush, gins’, mungub, lithma, yashmik, habarah, izar. A few terms
> refer to items used as face covers only. These are qina, burqu, niqab,
> lithma. Others refer to headcovers that are situationally held by the
> individual to cover part of the face. These are khimar, sitara, abayah
> or inrrah. (El Guindi 1999 p. 7)

Traditional Islamic costume for women seems to have included the
[abaya](/abaya "wikilink"), the [chador](/chador "wikilink"), and the
[burqa](/burqa "wikilink"), as well as many other forms of dress and
headcovering.

## Sports wear

A new type of athletic jilbab has been developed by Nike.[4] This allows
women to play volleyball while still respecting a traditional clothing
style.[5]

## Indonesian definition

*Jilbab*, in [Indonesia](/Indonesia "wikilink") is used to refer to a
headscarf rather than a long and loose overgarment.[6]
