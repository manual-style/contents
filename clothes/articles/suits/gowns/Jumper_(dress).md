A **jumper** or **jumper dress** (in [American
English](American_English "wikilink")), **pinafore dress** or informally
**pinafore** ([British English](British_English "wikilink"))[1][2] is a
sleeveless, collarless [dress](dress "wikilink") intended to be worn
over a [blouse](blouse "wikilink"), [shirt](shirt "wikilink"),
[T-shirt](T-shirt "wikilink") or [sweater](sweater "wikilink").[3][4][5]
[Hemlines](Hemline "wikilink") can be of different lengths and the type
of collar and whether or not there is pleating are also variables in the
design.[6]

In British English, the term *jumper* describes what is called a
*[sweater](sweater "wikilink")* in American English. Also, in more
formal British usage, a distinction is made between a pinafore dress and
a [pinafore](pinafore "wikilink"). The latter, though a related garment,
has an open back and is worn as an apron. In American English,
*pinafore* always refers to an [apron](apron "wikilink").

A [sundress](sundress "wikilink"), like a jumper, is sleeveless and
collarless; however, such articles are not worn over a blouse or
sweater, and are of distinctly different cuts and fashions. The apron
dress may be viewed as a special case of the jumper. If the design of
the dress is directly inspired by an [apron](apron "wikilink") (having a
bib in front and ties in the back, for example), the garment is
typically described as an **apron dress**.

## History

Jumper dresses for fall were described in *[The Fort Wayne
Sentinel](The_News-Sentinel "wikilink")* in 1906.[7] The dresses were
"imported from Paris" and featured "original lines."[8]

Jumper dresses in the [United States](United_States "wikilink") were
part of the [sportswear](Sportswear_(fashion) "wikilink") collections of
[Jean Patou](Jean_Patou "wikilink"), [Coco
Chanel](Coco_Chanel "wikilink") and [Paul
Poiret](Paul_Poiret "wikilink").[9] [Suzanne
Lenglen](Suzanne_Lenglen "wikilink") wore Patou's jumper design in the
1920s.[10] The dresses, worn over blouses, became popular during the
decade of the 1920s.[11] Jumper dresses were often worn in the summer
and made out of various types of fabrics.[12]

Jumper dresses were touted as an "American" and a "sports fashion" in
1930 by the *[Pittsburgh Press](Pittsburgh_Press "wikilink")*.[13] The
dresses were also praised for allowing women to create color
combinations through the choice of blouse worn underneath.[14]

Jumpers were again popularized in 1953, when [Hubert de
Givenchy](Hubert_de_Givenchy "wikilink") promoted his own jumper
dress.[15] Jumper dresses, now considered a "classic" look, were
considered "suitable to all ages."[16]

intended to be worn over a top or blouse, but the name refers to any
sleeveless dress that fastens behind. The name originates from the
aprons that were pinned to the front of a dress."
