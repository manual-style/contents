A **kirtle** (sometimes called [cotte](cotte "wikilink"), cotehardie) is
a garment that was worn by men and women in the [Middle
Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink"). It eventually became a one-piece garment
worn by women from the late Middle Ages into the
[Baroque](Baroque "wikilink") period. The kirtle was typically worn over
a [chemise](chemise "wikilink") or [smock](smock_(garment) "wikilink"),
which acted as a slip, and under the formal outer garment or
[gown](gown "wikilink")/[surcoat](surcoat "wikilink").

Kirtles were part of fashionable attire into the middle of the sixteenth
century, and remained part of country or middle-class clothing into the
seventeenth century.

Kirtles began as loose garments without a waist seam, changing to
tightly fitted supportive garments in the [14th
century](1300â€“1400_in_fashion "wikilink"). Later kirtles could be
constructed by combining a fitted [bodice](bodice "wikilink") with a
skirt gathered or pleated into the waist seam. Kirtles could lace up the
front, back or side-back, with some rare cases of side lacing, all
depending on the fashion of the day/place and what kind of gown was to
be worn over it. Kirtles could be embellished with a variety of
decorations including gold, silk, tassels, and knobs.[1]
