![](Ironing.jpg "fig:Ironing.jpg") A **Kitty Foyle** is a
[dress](dress_(garment) "wikilink") style of the 1940s characterized by
a dark fabric and contrasting light
[collar](collar_(clothing) "wikilink") and [cuffs](cuff "wikilink"),
typically of navy blue and white. The shape of the dress is a
[shirtwaist](shirtwaist "wikilink") with short or elbow-length
sleeves.[1] The buttons of the shirtwaist are in the same contrast
colour used for the collar.

It is named after a dress worn by [Ginger
Rogers](Ginger_Rogers "wikilink")' character in the 1940 [film of the
same name](Kitty_Foyle_(film) "wikilink"),[2] designed by
[Renié](Renié "wikilink"). The style has been explained as being
deliberately intended for films, the large amount of white around the
face reflecting the [key light](key_light "wikilink") onto the face,
giving a well-defined and flattering profile.[3] As a modest and
practical style that was easily copied at home, or could even be used to
update an old shirtwaist dress to a new fashion by applying a new
collar, it became popular during the wartime
[austerity](austerity "wikilink") period.

The style has returned to fashion at times since. The designer [Jill
Richards](Jill_Richards_(designer) "wikilink"), herself a Hollywood
actress of around the same era, favoured it in her collections of the
1970s, attracting a clientele of names such as [Nancy
Reagan](Nancy_Reagan "wikilink").[4]

This dress has also been adopted more recently as an adaption of the
[gothic lolita](gothic_lolita "wikilink") style. It takes the usual
gothic lolita themes of modesty, tradition and monochrome colours of a
dark base with a light contrast, but applies them to a later period with
simpler lines, rather than the more usual
[antebellum](Antebellum_Era_in_the_United_States "wikilink") fussy bows
and [flounces](Flounce_(fabric) "wikilink"). This style is typified by
characters such as [Lenore, the Cute Little Dead
Girl](Lenore,_the_Cute_Little_Dead_Girl "wikilink") and [Wednesday
Addams](Wednesday_Addams "wikilink").
