## About

Lingerie dresses were heavily decorated and designed to look like a
[Regency era](/Regency_era "wikilink") chemise gown.[1] The dresses
featured full skirts, blouses and sleeves of varying lengths.[2] They
were most often white, but not always.[3] The dresses could also be worn
over different colored [gowns](/Gown "wikilink") or
[slips](/Slip_(clothing) "wikilink"), expanding a woman's
wardrobe.[4][5] The dresses were named "lingerie" in order to emphasize
the lightness and thinness of the dresses, not to suggest
[lingerie](/lingerie "wikilink") as an undergarment.[6] The more sheer
the lingerie dress, the better.[7] The dresses were made of various
fabrics, including [linen](/linen "wikilink"),
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink") or [silk](/silk "wikilink") and parts of
the dress were see-through to reveal the slip or gown worn
underneath.[8]

Lingerie dresses were worn by various classes of women in [North
America](/North_America "wikilink") and [Europe](/Europe "wikilink") in
the decade of the 1900s up to the 1920s.[9][10] They were often worn at
outdoor activities and were touted as being appropriate for warm
weather.[11][12] They were also easier to wash than other kinds of
dresses.[13] In addition, they were praised for their simplicity which
also implied that they were less costly than other types of dresses.[14]

The dresses could be bought ready-made or created at home by
pattern.[15] They could be accessorized with collars, laces and bows on
the neck.[16] Other accessories included lingerie hats and
[parasols](/Umbrella "wikilink").[17] Dresses were embellished with
[lace](/lace "wikilink") and [embroidery](/embroidery "wikilink"),
including eyelet embroidery.[18][19]
