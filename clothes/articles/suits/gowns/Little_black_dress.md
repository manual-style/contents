A **little black dress** (**LBD**) is a black
[evening](/evening_gown "wikilink") or [cocktail
dress](/cocktail_dress "wikilink"), cut simply and often quite short.
[Fashion historians](/History_of_fashion_design "wikilink") ascribe the
origins of the little black dress to the 1920s designs of [Coco
Chanel](/Coco_Chanel "wikilink") and [Jean
Patou](/Jean_Patou "wikilink")[1] intended to be long-lasting,
versatile, affordable, accessible to the widest market possible and in a
neutral colour. Its ubiquity is such that it is often simply referred to
as the "LBD".[2][3][4] [thumb\|Variations on Chanel's little black dress
during the Chanel: The Legend exhibition at the Gemeentemuseum in The
Hague.](/File:Klein_zwart_jurkje.JPG "wikilink") The "little black
dress" is considered essential to a complete
[wardrobe](/Clothing "wikilink") by many women and fashion observers,
who believe it a "rule of fashion" that every woman should own a simple,
elegant black dress that can be dressed up or down depending on the
occasion: for example, worn with a jacket and pumps for daytime business
wear or with more ornate jewelry and accessories for evening or a formal
event such as a [wedding](/wedding "wikilink") or a
[ball](/ball_(dance_party) "wikilink").

## History

Black has always been [a color rich in
symbolism](/Black#Associations_and_symbolism "wikilink"). In the early
18th century, black represented romance and artistry. As [Ann
Demeulemeester](/Ann_Demeulemeester "wikilink") said of it, "Black is
poetic. How do you imagine a poet? In a bright yellow jacket? Probably
not." In the early 19th century, black was adopted by the
[Romantics](/Romantics "wikilink") such as [Byron](/Byron "wikilink"),
[Shelley](/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley "wikilink"), and
[Keats](/Keats "wikilink"), due to its melancholic aura. As the
[Victorian era](/Victorian_era "wikilink") began, black transitions from
a color of art to one of grief and mourning – widows were expected to
wear black for at least four years – and also for service livery, as the
uniform for [maids](/maid "wikilink").

In 1926 [Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel](/Gabrielle_Chanel "wikilink")
published a picture of a short, simple black dress in American
*[Vogue](/Vogue_(magazine) "wikilink")*. It was calf-length, straight
and decorated only by a few diagonal lines. *Vogue* called it "Chanel's
Ford". Like the [Model T](/Model_T "wikilink"), the little black dress
was simple and accessible for women of all social classes. *Vogue* also
said that the LBD would become "a sort of uniform for all women of
taste".[5] This, as well as other designs by the house of Chanel helped
disassociate black from mourning, and reinvent it as the uniform of the
high-class, wealthy, and chic. As Coco herself proclaimed, "I imposed
black; it's still going strong today, for black wipes out everything
else around."[6]

The little black dress continued to be popular through the [Great
Depression](/Great_Depression "wikilink"), predominantly through its
economy and elegance, albeit with the line lengthened somewhat.
[Hollywood](/Hollywood "wikilink")'s influence on fashion helped the
little black dress's popularity, but for more practical reasons: as
[Technicolor](/Technicolor "wikilink") films became more common,
filmmakers relied on little black dresses because other colors looked
distorted on screen and botched the coloring process. During [World War
II](/World_War_II "wikilink"), the style continued in part due to
widespread rationing of textiles, and in part as a common uniform
(accessorized for businesswear) for civilian women entering the
workforce. [alt=\|thumb\|300x300px\|Black evening dress by Jean
Patou](/File:Black_evening_dress_by_Patou.jpg "wikilink") The rise of
[Dior's "New Look"](/The_New_Look_(style) "wikilink") in the post-war
era and the sexual conservatism of the 1950s returned the little black
dress to its roots as a uniform and a symbol of the dangerous woman.
Hollywood [femme fatales](/femme_fatale "wikilink") and [fallen
women](/fallen_women "wikilink") characters were portrayed often in
black halter-style dresses in contrast to the more conservative dresses
of housewives or more wholesome Hollywood stars. Synthetic fibres made
popular in the 1940s and 1950s broadened the availability and
affordability of many designs.

The generation gap of the 1960s created a dichotomy in the design of the
little black dress. The younger "[mod](/mod_(subculture) "wikilink")"
generation preferred, in general, a miniskirt on their versions of the
dress and designers catering to the [youth
culture](/youth_culture "wikilink") continued to push the envelope -
shortening the skirt even more, creating cutouts or slits in the skirt
or bodice of the dress, using sheer fabrics such as
[netting](/netting "wikilink") or [tulle](/Tulle_(netting) "wikilink").
Many women aspired to simple black sheath dresses similar to the [black
Givenchy dress](/Black_Givenchy_dress_of_Audrey_Hepburn "wikilink") worn
by [Audrey Hepburn](/Audrey_Hepburn "wikilink") in the film *[Breakfast
at Tiffany's](/Breakfast_at_Tiffany's_(film) "wikilink")*.

The popularity of casual fabrics, especially knits, for dress and
business wear during the 1980s brought the little black dress back into
vogue. Coupled with the fitness craze, the new designs incorporated
details already popular at the time such as broad shoulders or
[peplums](/Overskirt "wikilink"): later in the decade and into the
1990s, simpler designs in a variety of lengths and fullness were
popular. The [grunge](/Grunge#Presentation_and_fashion "wikilink")
culture of the 1990s saw the combination of the little black dress with
both sandals and [combat boots](/combat_boots "wikilink"), though the
dress itself remained simple in cut and fabric.

The new glamour of the late 1990s led to new variations of the dress
but, like the 1950s and the 1970s, colour re-emerged as a factor in
fashion and formalwear and repeatedly shows an aversion to black. The
resurgence of body conscious clothing, muted colour schemes, and the
reemergence of predominant black, along with the retrospective trends of
the 1980s in the late 2000s paved way to the return of interest to the
dress.

## Famous little black dresses

The [black Givenchy dress of Audrey
Hepburn](/black_Givenchy_dress_of_Audrey_Hepburn "wikilink") as Holly
Golightly in *[Breakfast at
Tiffany’s](/Breakfast_at_Tiffany's_(film) "wikilink")*, designed by
[Hubert de Givenchy](/Hubert_de_Givenchy "wikilink"), epitomized the
standard for wearing little black dresses accessorized with pearls
(together called "basic black"), as was frequently seen throughout the
early 1960s. The dress set a record in 2006 when it was auctioned for
£410,000, six times its original estimate.[7]

[Betty Boop](/Betty_Boop "wikilink"), a cartoon character based in part
on the 1920s "[it girl](/it_girl "wikilink")" [Clara
Bow](/Clara_Bow "wikilink"), was drawn wearing a little black dress in
her early films, though with [Technicolor](/Technicolor "wikilink")
later, Betty's dress became red.[8] [thumb\|Betty Boop by Max Fleischer,
1931](/File:Betty_Boop_patent_fig1.jpg "wikilink")

[Wallis Simpson](/Wallis_Simpson "wikilink"), Duchess of Windsor, was
known to own several little black dresses and said much in praise of the
garments. One quote of the Duchess: "When a little black dress is right,
there is nothing else to wear in its place."[9]

[Edith Piaf](/Edith_Piaf "wikilink"), the French folk icon, performed in
a black sheath dress throughout her career: for this habit she was
nicknamed "little black sparrow". It was thought that the dress helped
audiences focus more on Piaf's singing and less on her appearance.[10]

[Diana, Princess of Wales](/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales "wikilink") wore a
black Christina Stambolian dress while at Serpentine Gallery’s summer
party, hosted by Vanity Fair in June 1994, the night [Charles, Prince of
Wales](/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales "wikilink") admitted he had an
adulterous relationship with
[Camilla](/Camilla,_Duchess_of_Cornwall "wikilink"), [Duchess of
Cornwall](/Camilla,_Duchess_of_Cornwall "wikilink"). Diana's dress has
been compared to a "little black dress"[11]

In an incident at [London](/London "wikilink")'s [Covent
Garden](/Covent_Garden "wikilink") theatre in 2004, a director fired the
then-[obese](/obseity "wikilink") [soprano](/soprano "wikilink")
[Deborah Voigt](/Deborah_Voigt "wikilink") from an
[opera](/opera "wikilink") because she could not fit into a "little
black cocktail dress", replacing her with the slimmer [Anne
Schwanewilms](/Anne_Schwanewilms "wikilink").[12][13][14][15]
