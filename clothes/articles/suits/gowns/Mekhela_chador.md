\]\] **Mekhela Sador** (, ) is the indigenous traditional
[Assamese](Assamese_people "wikilink") dress.

## Draping

There are two main pieces of cloth that are draped around the body.

The bottom portion, draped from the waist downwards, is called the
mekhela (). It is actually a form of a [sarong](sarong "wikilink"), a
very wide cylinder of cloth that is folded into one or two pleats to fit
around the waist and tucked in. The folds are to the right and are very
less (maximum two), as opposed to the pleats in the [Nivi
style](Saree#Nivi_style "wikilink") of the [saree](saree "wikilink"),
which are folded to the left and have multiple pleats. Strings are never
used to tie the mekhela around the waist, though an underskirt with a
string is often used.

The top portion of the two-piece dress, called the chador (pronounced:
Sadowr), is a long length of cloth that has one end tucked into the
upper portion of the mekhela and the rest draped over and around the
rest of the body. Unlike the [Pavadai Davani](Langa_Bonus "wikilink"),
the chador is tucked in triangular folds. A fitted blouse is often worn,
though in the past and traditionally another garment called a riha was
and is still worn. A riha is still worn as part of the Assamese bridal
trousseau and in other indigenous traditional events like Bihu etc., but
sometimes over a fitted blouse.

## Patterns

Ornamental designs on the mekhela-chadors are traditionally woven, never
printed. Sometimes a woven pattern, called the pari, is stitched along
the sides of a chador, or along the bottom of a mekhela.

## Weaving materials

Traditional mekhela chadors are made from the following materials:

-   [Cotton](Cotton "wikilink")
-   [Muga](Muga_silk "wikilink")
-   [Pat silk](Pat_silk "wikilink")
-   [Eri silk](Eri_silk "wikilink")

Some modern low-budget sets are also made with varying blends of cotton
and muga or pat silk with synthetic materials.

## Availibility

The mekhela chador is available in many stores across
[Guwahati](Guwahati "wikilink") and other cities of
[Assam](Assam "wikilink"). They are also available through various
websites.[1][2][3][4]
