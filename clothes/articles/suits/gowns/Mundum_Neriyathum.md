**Mundum neriyathum** ([Malayalam](Malayalam "wikilink"): മുണ്ട്
നേരിയത്; settu-mundu or mundu-set) is the traditional clothing of women
in [Kerala](Kerala "wikilink"), [South India](South_India "wikilink").
It is the oldest remnant of the ancient form of the
[saree](saree "wikilink") which covered only the lower part of the
body.[1][2] In the mundum neriyathum, the most basic traditional piece
is the *[mundu](mundu "wikilink")* or lower garment which is the ancient
form of the saree denoted in [Malayalam](Malayalam "wikilink") as
'Thuni' (meaning cloth), while the *neriyathu* forms the upper garment
the mundu.[3][4] The mundum neryathum consists of two pieces of cloth,
and could be worn in either the traditional style with the *neriyathu*
tucked inside the blouse, or in the modern style with the *neriyathu*
worn over the left shoulder.[5]

## Origins

The mundum-neryathum is the extant form of the ancient saree referred to
as "Sattika" in [Buddhist](Buddhist "wikilink") and
[Jain](Jain "wikilink") literature.[6] The mundu is the surviving form
of lower garment of the ancient clothing referred to as antariya worn in
a special way (lower garment).[7] The neriyath is the modern adaptation
of a thin scarf worn from the right shoulder to the left shoulder
referred to in ancient Buddhist-Jain texts as the *uttariya*.[8][9]

Some authors suggest narrow borders along the mundum neriyathum drape
are probably an adaptation of the west Asiatic veiling called "Palla".
In the palmyrene costume, the piece of cloth known as "palla" was a long
piece of unstitched cloth with a coloured border and was worn over a
long garment, pinned at the left shoulder.[10] The Malabar coast had
flourishing overseas trade with the Mediterranean world since
antiquity.[11][12][13][14][15]

However, the word "Palla" does not find it's mention in Indian
literature until the advent of Islam in medieval India, the terminology
is limited to Hindustani literature, it was not known or in use in
Kerala during 1900s and the terminology may itself have been came into
use in Kerala in 1950.[16] In contrast, various terminology for veiling
were known in ancient Indian literature and continue to be in use
regional variations, in Kerala literature *Neryathum* upper garment and
narrow-borders known as *Karalkudu* are remnant of such ancient
garment.[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24]

## Basic drape

shown draped in a variation of the mundum neriyathum forming the modern
Nivi style'\]\]

The mundum neryathum is traditionally white or cream in colour and
consists of two pieces of cloth, which have a coloured strip at the
border known as *kara*. The piece of cloth that drapes the lower garment
is called the mundu. It is worn below the navel and around the hips,
similar to the [mundu](mundu "wikilink") worn by men in
[Kerala](Kerala "wikilink"). The piece of cloth that is worn as the
upper garment is called the neriyathu. One end of the neriyathu is
tucked inside the pavada or petticoat and the remaining long end is worn
across the front torso. The neriyathu is worn over a blouse that reaches
quite above the breast bone. It is worn diagonally from along the right
hips to the left shoulder and across the midriff, partly baring it. The
remaining loose end of the neriyathu is left hanging from the left
shoulder, resembling the 'nivi saree'. Today the 'nivi drape', is the
most common form of the saree.[25] A mundum neriyathum is starched
before being draped and is worn over a blouse that matches the colour of
the border or kara.

## Ornamental and festive use

The mundum neryathum is worn as everyday costume and also as distinct
costume on festive occasions, in which case the Kara is ornamental in
couture. During the Keralite festival of [onam](onam "wikilink"), women
of all ages wear the mundum neryathum and take part in folk dance meant
only for women called *kaikottikalli*. The mundum neryathum for festive
occasion has golden coloured borders or a broad zari border known as
*Kasavu*, lending the costume another name of "Kasavu Saree". The colour
for the blouse of the mundum neryathum for this occasion is determined
by the age and marital status of the woman. Young unmarried girls wear
green coloured blouse, while married middle aged mothers wear red
blouses.

The kasavu or the golden border is either pure golden layer, copper
coated or artificial. The fabric of mundu-sari is cotton and is always
woven by hand. Kara or simple line designs adorn the bottom of these
saris, while at times small peacock or temple designs embellish the
pallu. The mundum neriyathum is also known as *Set mundu*, Kasavu mundu,
Mundu-sari, set-sari, or set veshti. The veshti is another version of
the saree which consists of small upper clothing resembling a
blouse-like garment worn without the pallu along with a mundu as lower
garment.

## Kerala sari

The [Kerala sari](Kerala_sari "wikilink") is worn as a garment that
consists of a single piece of cloth. Otherwise, the Kerala sari closely
resembles the mundum neriyathum and is often worn by
[Malayali](Malayali "wikilink") women as a
[quasi](:wikt:quasi- "wikilink") mundum neriyathum.

## Cultural symbolism

The mundum neriyathum is the cultural costume of women of the
[Malayali](Malayali "wikilink") community.[26][27] The grace and appeal
of the golden borders contrasting with the otherwise plain white mundum
neryathum of Keralite women has come to symbolize Malayali women. Both
the traditional and modern styles of the mundum neryathum are depicted
in the paintings of the Indian painter [Raja Ravi
Varma](Raja_Ravi_Varma "wikilink"). The mundum neriyathum was modified
in several paintings depicting Shakuntala from the Mahabharata to a
style of draping now popularly known as the 'nivi saree' or 'national
drape'. In one of his paintings the [Indian
subcontinent](Indian_subcontinent "wikilink") was shown as a mother
wearing a flowing nivi saree.[28]
