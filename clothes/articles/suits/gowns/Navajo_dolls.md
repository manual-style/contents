**Navajo Dolls** describe a style of [clothing](clothing "wikilink")
that [Navajo](Navajo_people "wikilink") women copied from east coast
American society in the 1860s. Women of that era wore full dresses made
out of [satin](satin "wikilink"). [President
Lincoln's](Abraham_Lincoln "wikilink")
[wife](Mary_Todd_Lincoln "wikilink") and friends wore full dresses made
of satin. Navajo women copied the patterns but substituted
[velvet](velvet "wikilink") for the satin and made buttons out of
nickels and dimes. These stylish skirts are still fashionable today, for
Navajos and non-Navajos alike.
