The **negligee** or **''négligée**'' (), literally meaning "neglected",
known in French as **déshabillé**, is a form of [see-through
clothing](/see-through_clothing "wikilink") for women consisting of a
sheer usually long dressing gown.[1] It is a form of
[nightgown](/nightgown "wikilink") intended for wear at night and in the
bedroom. It was introduced in [France](/France "wikilink") in the 18th
century, where it mimicked the heavy head-to-toe style of women's day
dresses of the time.

By the 1920s, the negligee began to mimic women's
[satin](/satin "wikilink") single-layer [evening
dress](/evening_gown "wikilink") of the period. The term "negligee" was
used on a [Royal Doulton](/Royal_Doulton "wikilink") run of ceramic
figurines in 1927, showing women wearing what appears to be a one-piece
knee-length [silk](/silk "wikilink") or [rayon](/rayon "wikilink")
[slip](/Slip_(clothing) "wikilink"), trimmed with
[lace](/lace "wikilink"). Although the evening-dresses style of
[nightwear](/nightwear "wikilink") made moves towards the modern
negligee style—translucent [bodices](/bodice "wikilink"),
[lace](/lace "wikilink") trimming, bows, exemplified in 1941 by a
photo[2][3][4] of [Rita Hayworth](/Rita_Hayworth "wikilink")[5][6] in
[*Life*](/Life_magazine "wikilink")—it was only after [World War
II](/World_War_II "wikilink") that nightwear changed from being
primarily utilitarian to being primarily sensual or even
[erotic](/erotic "wikilink"); the negligee emerged strongly as a form of
[lingerie](/lingerie "wikilink").

Modern negligees are often much looser and made of sheer and diaphanous
fabrics and trimmed with [lace](/lace "wikilink") or other fine
material, and bows. Multiple layers of fabric are often used. The modern
negligee thus perhaps owes more to women's fine
[bedjackets](/bedjacket "wikilink") or bed-capes, and up-market slips
than to the [nightgown](/nightgown "wikilink"). It spread to a mass
market, benefitting from the introduction of cheap
[synthetic](/Synthetic_fibre "wikilink") [fabrics](/textile "wikilink")
such as [nylon](/nylon "wikilink") and its finer successors. From the
1940s to the 1970s, the trend was for negligees to become shorter in
length (e.g. the [babydoll](/babydoll "wikilink") of the 1970s).
Negligees made from the 1940s to the 1970s are now collectible
[vintage](/vintage_clothing "wikilink") items.

In the [UK](/United_Kingdom "wikilink") in 2004, negligees accounted for
only four percent of women's [nightwear](/nightwear "wikilink") sales,
women's [pyjamas](/pyjamas "wikilink") having dominated since the
mid-1980s. However, UK negligee sales are said to have been the fastest
increasing sector of the market since 1998.[7]
