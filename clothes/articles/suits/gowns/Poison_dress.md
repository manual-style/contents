The tale known as "**The Poison Dress**", or "**Embalmed Alive**"[1]
features a [dress](dress "wikilink") that has in some way been
[poisoned](poison "wikilink"). This is a recurring theme throughout
legends and folk tales of various cultures, including [Ancient
Greece](Ancient_Greece "wikilink"), [Mughal
India](Mughal_India "wikilink"), and the [United
States](United_States "wikilink"). Although lacking evidence suggesting
that some American [urban legends](urban_legend "wikilink") are directly
linked to the classical tales, they share several common
[motifs](motif_(narrative) "wikilink").[2]

## Greek mythology

The poison dress motif is similar to the [Shirt of
Flame](Shirt_of_Flame "wikilink"). In [Greek
mythology](Greek_mythology "wikilink"), when [Jason](Jason "wikilink")
left the sorceress [Medea](Medea "wikilink") to marry Glauce, King
[Creon](Creon "wikilink")'s daughter, Medea took her revenge by sending
Glauce a poison dress and a golden [coronet](coronet "wikilink"), also
dipped in poison. This resulted in the death of the princess and,
subsequently, the king, when he tried to save her.

The Shirt of Nessus is smeared with the poisoned blood of the centaur
[Nessus](Nessus_(mythology) "wikilink"), which was given to
[Hercules](Hercules "wikilink") by Hercules' wife,
[Deianira](Deianira "wikilink"). Deianira had been tricked by Nessus and
made to believe that the blood would ensure Hercules's
[faithfulness](faithfulness "wikilink"). According to
[Sophocles](Sophocles "wikilink")' tragedy *[The Women of
Trachis](Women_of_Trachis "wikilink")*, Hercules began to perspire when
he put on the shirt, which soon clung to his flesh, corroding it. He
eventually threw himself onto a pyre on [Mount
Oeta](Mount_Oeta "wikilink") in extreme agony and burned to death.[3]

## Indian folklore

![](Aurangazeb.jpg "fig:Aurangazeb.jpg") (reign 1658-1707), considered
by his subjects a [fakir](fakir "wikilink") or wizard,[4] was credited
with using poison khilats to eliminate some of his perceived
enemies.\]\]

Numerous tales of poison [khilats](khilat "wikilink") (robes of honour)
have been recorded in historical, folkloric, and medical texts of
British Indianists.[5][6] Gifts of clothing were common in major
life-cycle rituals in pre-industrial India, and these stories revolve
around fears of betrayal, inspired by ancient custom of giving khilats
to friends and enemies as demonstrations of a social relationship or a
political alliance.[7]

In 1870, [Norman Chevers](Norman_Chevers "wikilink"), M.D., a
Surgeon-Major to the Bengal Medical Service, authored *Manual of Medical
Jurisprudence for India*, describing unusual crimes involving poisons
native to India. The book included three cases of poison khilat death,
attributing the cause of one of the deaths to lethal
[vesicants](vesicant "wikilink") impregnating the fabric of the robe and
entering the victim's [sweat pores](sweat_pore "wikilink").[8]

## American urban legends

The theme of the poison dress appears in several American [urban
legends](urban_legend "wikilink"), which were recorded in folklore
collections and journal articles in the 1940s and 1950s.[9]
[Folklorist](Folklorist "wikilink") [Stith
Thompson](Stith_Thompson "wikilink") noted the classical prototype in
these stories, "[Shirt of Nessus](Shirt_of_Nessus "wikilink")", and
assigned Motif D1402.5, "Magic shirt burns wearer up". [Jan Harold
Brunvand](Jan_Harold_Brunvand "wikilink") provides the summary of one of
the stories:

Folklorist Ernest Baughman speculated that the story might have been
used as adverse publicity to discredit a well-known store, since several
variants of the story specifically mention the name of the store at
which the dress was supposedly purchased.[10] The legend continued to be
told long after its initial popularity, with "embalming fluid" sometimes
replacing the formaldehyde mentioned in the earlier version.[11] This
urban legend was dramatized in the episode "['Til Death Do We
Part]('Til_Death_Do_We_Part_(CSI:_NY_episode) "wikilink")," from the
crime-scene drama, *[CSI: NY](CSI:_NY "wikilink")*.

Also contributing to the poison-dress theme is the prevalence of
[smallpox-contaminated blankets](Smallpox_blankets "wikilink"), which
were given to [native
Americans](Native_Americans_in_the_United_States "wikilink").[12] Well
documented examples include the [tainted blankets gifted to Indians at
Fort
Pitt](Siege_of_Fort_Pitt#Biological_warfare_involving_smallpox "wikilink")
in 1763.[13]
