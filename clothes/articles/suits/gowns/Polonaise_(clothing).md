of the later [1770s and 1780s](1750â€“1795_in_fashion "wikilink") or a
similar revival style of the [1870s](1870s_in_fashion "wikilink")
inspired by [Polish](Poland "wikilink") national costume,[1] consisting
of a [gown](gown "wikilink") with a cutaway, draped and swagged
[overskirt](overskirt "wikilink"), worn over an [underskirt or
petticoat](petticoat "wikilink"). From the late 19th century, the
term***polonaise*** also described a fitted overdress which extended
into long panels over the underskirt, but was not necessarily draped or
swagged.

## Origin and structure

As early as the 1720s, English painters had begun to portray fashionable
ladies dressed in romanticized versions of the costume of a century
earlier, as depicted in portraits by [Van
Dyck](Anthony_Van_Dyck "wikilink") and
[Rubens](Peter_Paul_Rubens "wikilink"). By the 1770s, elements of this
style began to appear in fashionable dress, including the wide-brimmed
hat (dubbed the "Rubens hat" in the *Fashionable Magazine* of 1786) and
bunched-up skirts.[2]

![](Woman's_Robe_a_la_Polonaise_(Close-bodied_Gown)_LACMA_M.70.85_(10_of_10).jpg "fig:Woman's_Robe_a_la_Polonaise_(Close-bodied_Gown)_LACMA_M.70.85_(10_of_10).jpg"),
M.70.85.[3]\]\]

About the same time, French fashion adopted a number of styles of
English origin, such as the [close-bodied
gown](close-bodied_gown "wikilink") which they called *robe Ã
l'anglaise*, and the fullness of the skirts at the back waist and over
the hips. One way to "create the fashionable bulk at the back and sides
of the dress was to kilt up the overskirt by means of interior or
exterior loops, buttons or tassels to form swags of material. This style
... was known as *Ã  la polonaise*."[4] This style was characterized by
ankle length petticoats that revealed high-heeled walking shoes. Due to
this it served as a practical garment for walking because the skirts did
not drag along the ground.[5]

Since the beginning of the 18th century, middle-class women had adopted
various impromptu ways of kilting their overskirts up out of the muck of
the streets. The *polonaise* was a fashionable variant of this style.
The name *Polonaise* (or *polonese*) derives "obviously from Polish
stylesâ€”whether it referred originally to the fur trimming or to the
kilting up to one side (a Polish fashion which came from Turkish
costume) is not really clear."[6] There is some controversy over
application of the name *polonaise* to 18th century dress. Some sources
define it as being cut in the same fashion as a *robe Ã  l'anglaise*, but
with cords pulling up the skirts in two places in the back, and they
date the style from the beginning of the 1770s.[7] Others explicitly
refute this: Waugh states that the *robe Ã  l'anglaise* was often
equipped with tapes to draw up the skirt, and on the topic of the
*polonaise* says:

> Though this term is often applied to any eighteenth-century dress with
> back drapery, it belongs, strictly speaking, to an over dress that
> appeared c. 1775. This was cut like the man's coat of the same period,
> with centre back and two far-back side seams all terminating in
> inverted pleats, the front being in one piece with an underarm dart.
> It was caught to the top of the bodice centre front ...[8]

[Aileen Ribeiro](Aileen_Ribeiro "wikilink") describes the *polonaise* as
"cut in four parts, two at the front and two at the back,"[9] with the
bodice closed at the top center front and sloping away at the sides,
leaving a triangular gap that was filled by a false waistcoat. Sleeves
could be three-quarter length or long, and various styles such as the
Irish, Italian and French *polonaise* were described by
contemporaries.[10] A variation on the *robe Ã  la polonaise* was the
*robe Ã  la circassienne*, cut the same but trimmed with
"[oriental](oriental "wikilink")" tassels or fur.[11]

## 19th century usage and revival

![](Albert_von_Keller_-_Bildnis_der_MÃ¼nchener_Hofschauspielerin_Mimi_Cramer,_1875.jpg "fig:Albert_von_Keller_-_Bildnis_der_MÃ¼nchener_Hofschauspielerin_Mimi_Cramer,_1875.jpg"),
1875. The sitter wears a blue silk polonaise basque over a white
underskirt.\]\] The term *polonaise* was applied to a variety of
garments throughout the 19th century, often because their styling was
thought to be Polish in inspiration. One such example was the
[witzchoura](witzchoura "wikilink"), a fur-lined cloak with sleeves
sometimes described as being *Ã  la Polonaise*.[12] In May 1868 the
*Ladies' Monthly Magazine* published a coloured [fashion
plate](fashion_plate "wikilink") showing a green silk dress with an
asymmetrically opening front described as being made *Ã  la Polonaise*,
along with a [pattern](pattern_(sewing) "wikilink") for making it
up.[13]

During the very late 1860s references to historical dress became
fashionable, including draped overskirts loosely based on the 18th
century *robe Ã  la polonaise*.[14] In 1871 *[Peterson's
Magazine](Peterson's_Magazine "wikilink")* stated that the polonaise was
an overdress based on the 18th century
[sacque](sack-back_gown "wikilink"), with the bodice cut in one with the
gathered-up skirt.[15] *Peterson's Magazine* also described a 'Polonaise
[basque](basque_(clothing) "wikilink")' as being gathered fully on the
hips and forming a deep tunic in the back.[16] *[Godey's
Magazine](Godey's_Lady's_Book "wikilink")* for August 1871 identifies
the term *polonaise* with two separate garments, a bodice and an
overskirt:

![](Polonaise_1883.jpg "Polonaise_1883.jpg")

The second paragraph quoted describes a specific style of dressing *Ã  la
polonaise* which was popularly known as "[Dolly
Varden](Dolly_Varden_(costume) "wikilink")" after the heroine of
[Dickens'](Charles_Dickens "wikilink") historical novel *[Barnaby
Rudge](Barnaby_Rudge:_A_Tale_of_the_Riots_of_'Eighty "wikilink")* (set
in 1780).[17]

By the end of the 1870s and into the 1880s, the term 'polonaise' also
described an overdress which resembled a long coat worn over an
underskirt, sometimes with a waistcoat effect.[18] This could be draped
or undraped. In July 1894, *[The Sydney
Mail](The_Sydney_Mail "wikilink")* stated:

## 20th century

![](Redingote-polonaise-1914.png "fig:Redingote-polonaise-1914.png") The
polonaise underwent another revival in the mid-late 1910s. A 1914
newspaper advert for [McCall Patterns](McCall's "wikilink") found in the
*[Evening Independent](Evening_Independent "wikilink")* announced the
'redingote polonaise' to be the height of fashion in Paris and New
York.[19] The *[Reading Eagle](Reading_Eagle "wikilink")* ran a fashion
column in November 1915 describing the polonaise of 1914/15 as a French
design consisting of a long coat-like overdress of metallic lace or
elaborately decorated sheer fabric worn over a plain underdress.[20]
Another version of the polonaise was described by the *Meriden Daily
Journal* in September 1917:

After the First World War the term fell out of regular use, although was
occasionally used by fashion writers as a descriptive term in the
1930s-50s for any form of draping around the upper skirt. For example,
the *[Ottawa Citizen](Ottawa_Citizen "wikilink")* in 1942 stated:
