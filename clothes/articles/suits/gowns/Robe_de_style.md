The **robe de style** describes a style of
[dress](/Dress_(garment) "wikilink") popular in the
[1920s](/1920s_in_fashion "wikilink") as an alternative to the
straight-cut [chemise](/Chemise#Modern_chemise "wikilink") dress.

The style was characterised by its full skirts. The bodice could be
fitted, or straight-cut in the chemise manner, with a [dropped
waist](/Waistline_(clothing) "wikilink"), but it was the full skirt that
denoted the *robe de style*. Sometimes the fullness was supported with
[petticoats](/petticoats "wikilink"),
[panniers](/pannier_(clothing) "wikilink"), or
[hoops](/hoop_skirt "wikilink").

The *robe de style* was a signature design of the couturier [Jeanne
Lanvin](/Jeanne_Lanvin "wikilink").[1] Other couture houses known for
their versions of the *robe de style* included [Boué
Soeurs](/Boué_Soeurs "wikilink"), [Callot
Soeurs](/Callot_Soeurs "wikilink"), and
[Lucile](/Lucy,_Lady_Duff-Gordon "wikilink").[2]
