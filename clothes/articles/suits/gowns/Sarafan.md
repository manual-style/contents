A **sarafan** (, from *sarāpā*, literally "\[from\] head to feet"),[1]
is a long, trapezoidal [Russian](Russia "wikilink") [jumper
dress](jumper_dress "wikilink") ([pinafore dress](pinafore "wikilink"))
worn by girls and women and forming part of Russian traditional
[folk](Folk_culture "wikilink") costume.

Traditional Russian costume consists of straight, flowing spikes
Beginning at the turn of the 18th century, the sarafan became the most
popular article of peasant women's clothing in the Northern and Central
regions of Russia.[2] Sarafans were regularly worn until well into the
20th century, having first been mentioned in chronicles dating back to
the year 1376. The origin of the term Sarafan lies in Persia. Old Russia
cultivated especially during the era of [Grand Principality of
Moscow](Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow "wikilink") strong ties to [Western
Asia](Western_Asia "wikilink") and countries of the [Middle
East](Middle_East "wikilink") and served also as a intermediary in the
trade between Europe and Asian countries like Persia, as well as Turkey.
Sarafan most likely originated from a [kaftan](kaftan "wikilink")-like
costume which were worn in Russia by woman and men.[3] Sarafans became
mostly popular in the [Central](Central_Russia "wikilink") and [Northern
Russian](Northwest_Russia "wikilink") regions. Through trade with
Central Europe the quality and colour of clothes became better.

Sarafans had originally a tighter form but became wider through
influence of the [Russian Orthodox
Church](Russian_Orthodox_Church "wikilink").

After the reforms of [Peter the Great](Peter_the_Great "wikilink"),
which also introduced modern European cultural standards to Russia, only
peasants wore the Sarafan, while the upper classes switched to Central
European fashion.

In many areas of the former [Grand Principality of
Moscow](Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow "wikilink") and todays [Southern
Russia](Southern_Russia "wikilink") also the [poneva](poneva "wikilink")
costume was worn by woman[4][5]. Today the garment is most often seen at
performances of Russian [folk song](folk_song "wikilink"),
[dance](folk_dancing "wikilink") and is worn on Russian folk and
religious holidays. Designers as well from Russia as from Ukraine are
re-imagining the sarafan style with its old national heritage for the
21st century as summertime light dress that can actually be with its
modern shape a part of todays woman's wardrobe.[6][7]
