[thumb\|Sheath dress](/File:Sheath_dress.jpg "wikilink") In fashion, a
**sheath dress** is a fitted, straight cut dress, often nipped at the
waistline with no waist seam.[1] When constructing the dress, the
[bodice](/bodice "wikilink") and [skirt](/skirt "wikilink") are joined
together by combining the skirt [darts](/Dart_(sewing) "wikilink") into
one dart; this aligns the skirt darts with the bodice waist dart.[2] The
dress emphasizes the waist as its skirt portion is fitted. While the
sheath dress can come in many patterns and lengths, it often is worn
with short [sleeves](/sleeves "wikilink") and reaches knee length.[3]

## Ancient Egypt

Originating in the ancient world, the sheath dress is commonly seen in
[Egyptian art](/Egyptian_art "wikilink"). Presented as slender and
youthful, artistic renditions of the women in the garment are common
prior to the [New Kingdom](/New_Kingdom "wikilink"). Although there were
no archeological evidence of a sheath dress among the elite, women and
[deities](/deities "wikilink") are shown wearing said garment in tomb
drawings. The garment was often presented with a seam under the breast
and with beads. Ancient depictions of elite women showed the dress
paired with the tripartite [wig](/wig "wikilink") and vulture
[headdress](/headdress "wikilink"). With archaeologists finding nearly
twenty dresses of the ancient Egyptian world, there is no record of the
dress ever existing in reality. Instead, scholars have hypothesized that
the sheath dress as we know it were wrap dresses with straps,
[skirts](/skirts "wikilink"), or a V neck dress.[4]

## 19th century

The **Princess Sheath dress** was popular between 1878 and 1880. It was
associated with the Princess of Wales, later known as [Queen
Alexandra](/Queen_Alexandra "wikilink"). The Princess sheath is
constructed with the [bodice](/bodice "wikilink") and skirt cut in one
with a gored skirt. The dress was worn without a bustle but with a small
pad. To tighten the front of the dress, [ribbons](/ribbons "wikilink")
were attached in the back's interior.[5]

## 1900s

(14578977850)During](/File:The_Ladies'_home_journal_(1948)_(14578977850).jpg "wikilink")
the early 1900s, Americans were still looking to
[Paris](/Paris "wikilink") for the latest trends. American socialites
traveled to [Europe](/Europe "wikilink") to view collections and receive
custom outfits. [Paul Poiret](/Paul_Poiret "wikilink") is credited as
the first designer of the modern sheath dress. In doing so, he also
created a rubber [girdle](/girdle "wikilink") as an alternative to the
boned [corset](/corset "wikilink") to wear under the dress.[6] In great
contrast to the emphasized curves of [Victorian
era](/Victorian_era "wikilink") and earlier dress, the sheath dress
offered a sleek look that revealed the legs and lower torso with a
[slit](/wikt:slit "wikilink").[7] The style of the sheath dress reached
the United States in 1908. That fall, the production of *[Bandanna
Land](/Bandanna_Land "wikilink")*, a
[musical](/Musical_theatre "wikilink"), included the song "Sheath Gown
in Darktown", which the chorus goes:[8] <poem> Oh there's trouble down
in Old Darktown, Since Bella came with that sheath gown, Imported walk
and smile, and all that foreign style, And all the girls are badly hurt
as they watch her flirt that see-more skirt. The sheath gown it's got
Darktown, and will hold it for a while. </poem>

## 1950s

By the 1950s, the sheath dress became the modern look for American
women. In 1950, [Christian Dior](/Christian_Dior "wikilink") introduced
the "Vertical Line". The line catered to a woman's body and her curves
in comparison to previous years. From the line,
[Vogue](/Vogue_(magazine) "wikilink") called the sheath dress the "most
important single day fashion".[9] In 1956, a
[girdle](/girdle "wikilink") sales manager remarked “The sheath paid for
my house in Westport.”[10] Pattern companies sold sheath cuts up to size
22 ½ and 41 inch bust size. The dress was referred to as “the slim look
for five o’clock on”. For a casual look, the sheath dress was matched
with a short sleeve print [bolero](/bolero "wikilink"). As a business
attire, a box jacket when over the bolero as well as the dress.[11] As
the cut of the dress became easier to construct, textures were added to
the dress such as beads.[12]

## 1960s

One of the most notable sheath dresses of all time is the [black
Givenchy dress of Audrey
Hepburn](/black_Givenchy_dress_of_Audrey_Hepburn "wikilink"). In 1961,
Hepburn wore a [Hubert de Givenchy](/Hubert_de_Givenchy "wikilink")
black sheath dress in the film [Breakfast at
Tiffany's.](/Breakfast_at_Tiffany's_(film) "wikilink") By this time, her
dress became known as the [little black
dress](/little_black_dress "wikilink").[13] On May 19, 1962, [Marilyn
Monroe](/Marilyn_Monroe "wikilink") sang happy birthday to then
president [John F. Kennedy](/John_F._Kennedy "wikilink") for his 45th
birthday. At the event, Monroe wore a [Jean
Louis](/Jean_Louis "wikilink") sheath dress that is described as "skin
and beads". The dress was made nude toned, backless, and clad with
crystals.[14] Monroe was sewn into the dress for a tight fit. In 2016,
the Jean Louis design sold for $4.8 million.[15]

## 21st century

In recent years, the sheath dress is worn as a [cocktail
dress](/cocktail_dress "wikilink"). The pattern can also be seen worn on
brides as sheath dresses are popular as wedding dresses; the style is
recommended for slim brides who are either tall or petite.[16] At the
2008 [Democratic National
Convention](/Democratic_National_Convention "wikilink"), [Michelle
Obama](/Michelle_Obama "wikilink") wore a purple crepe sheath dress
designed by [Maria Pinto](/Maria_Pinto_(fashion_designer) "wikilink").
This dress was made notable when Michelle gave her husband, [Barack
Obama](/Barack_Obama "wikilink") a fist bump on stage.[17]
