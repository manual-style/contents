A **shift dress** is a dress in which the cloth falls straight from the
shoulders and has [darts](/Dart_(sewing) "wikilink") around the bust. It
frequently features a high [scoop](/scoop_neck "wikilink") or [boat
neck](/boat_neck "wikilink").[3]. Shift dresses are often confused with
the [sheath dress](/sheath_dress "wikilink"), which is form-fitting and
shaped by tucks on the waist area. Shift dresses became popular in
western fashion in the 1920s and were revived in the 1960s. They are
most flattering on body types that are more like columns.[4][5]

## History

The shift dress gained popularity during the western
[flapper](/flapper "wikilink") movement in the
[1920s](/1920s_in_Western_fashion "wikilink").[6] Changing social norms
meant that young women could choose a style of dress that was easier to
move and dance in, and the shift dress marked a departure from
previously fashionable [corset](/corset "wikilink") designs, which
exaggerated the bust and waist while restricting movement.[7][8]

It went out of fashion during wartime, and the post war era, where
western women's fashion was typified by Christian Dior's *[New
Look](/New_Look_(style_of_clothing) "wikilink")*, which again featured
an exaggerated bust, hips and waist at the expense of comfort.[9][10]

The shift dress made a comeback in the
[1960s](/1960s_in_Western_fashion "wikilink"), popularised by [Hubert de
Givenchy](/Hubert_de_Givenchy "wikilink")'s design for [Audrey
Hepburn](/Audrey_Hepburn "wikilink")'s *[Breakfast at
Tiffany's](/Breakfast_at_Tiffany's_(film) "wikilink")* dress, and [Lily
Pulitzer](/Lily_Pulitzer "wikilink")'s designs for [Jacqueline
Kennedy](/Jacqueline_Kennedy "wikilink"). This coincided with the start
of [second wave feminism](/second_wave_feminism "wikilink") which
brought in a renewed desire for freedom and versatility.[11]
