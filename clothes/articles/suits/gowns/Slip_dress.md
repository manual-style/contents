woman's dress that closely resembles an
[underslip](/slip_(clothing) "wikilink") or
[petticoat](/petticoat "wikilink").[1] It is traditionally [cut on the
bias](/bias_(textile) "wikilink"), with [spaghetti
straps](/spaghetti_strap "wikilink").[2] Slip dresses first became
widely worn in the [last decade of the 20th
century](/1990s_in_fashion "wikilink"), as part of the
[underwear-as-outerwear](/underwear-as-outerwear "wikilink") trend, when
they were made from layered [chiffon](/chiffon_(fabric) "wikilink"),
[polyester](/polyester "wikilink") [satins](/satin "wikilink") and
[charmeuse](/charmeuse "wikilink"), and often trimmed with lace.[3] The
slip dress looked like an undergarment, but was intended to be seen, and
through the use of lace and sheer elements, offer glimpses of the body
beneath.[4]

Designers associated with slip dresses include [John
Galliano](/John_Galliano "wikilink"), whose debut design for
[Dior](/Christian_Dior_S.A. "wikilink") was a lace-trimmed slip dress
worn by [Diana, Princess of Wales](/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales "wikilink")
in 1996;[5] [Calvin Klein](/Calvin_Klein "wikilink") and [Narciso
Rodriguez](/Narciso_Rodriguez "wikilink").[6]
