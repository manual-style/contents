wearing a stola and [palla](Palla_(garment) "wikilink")\]\]

The **stola** was the traditional garment of
[Roman](Ancient_Rome "wikilink") women, corresponding to the
[toga](toga "wikilink"), that was worn by men. The stola was usually
woollen.[1]

Originally, women wore [togas](toga "wikilink") as well, but after the
2nd century BC, the toga was worn exclusively by men, and women were
expected to wear the stola. At that point, it was considered disgraceful
for a woman to wear a toga; wearing the male garment was associated with
[prostitution](prostitution "wikilink") and
[adultery](adultery "wikilink").[2][3]

## History

The stola was a staple of fashion in ancient Rome spanning from the
early [Roman Republic](Roman_Republic "wikilink") through the [Roman
Empire](Roman_Empire "wikilink") and [Byzantine
Empire](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink") into the first millennium.

A well-known image of the stola is the one worn by the [Statue of
Liberty](Statue_of_Liberty "wikilink") in [New York
City](New_York_City "wikilink").

## Description

The stola was a long, pleated dress, worn over an undergarment called a
[tunic](tunic "wikilink") or **tunica intima** (the Roman version of a
[slip](slip_(clothing) "wikilink")). The stola was generally sleeveless
but versions of it did have short or long sleeves. These sleeves could
belong to the stola itself or be a part of the tunic. The traditional
sleeveless stola was fastened by clasps at the shoulder called
*fibulae*. The stola was typically girt with
[ribbons](ribbon "wikilink"), and typically had two belts. The first was
worn just below the breasts creating a great number of folds. The second
and wider belt was worn around the waist.

Stolas were generally made of fabrics like linen or wool, but a wealthy
woman could be seen wearing a stola made of silk. The stola was worn as
a symbol and represented a woman's [marital
status](marital_status "wikilink").

### Limbus

A wealthier woman might also have added a **limbus** to her stola. A
limbus was a separate piece of fabric with many folds that was sewn into
the hem of the stola creating the appearance of another gown being worn
beneath. This created the illusion of layers, a symbol of wealth and
status.

## Varieties

Stolas were made in a variety of colors including red, yellow, and blue.
Decorations were also added to the neckline and hem. For common women,
these would be a simple band of color or pattern. For wealthier women,
more details and embellishments were used. A wide ornamental border
called an **instita** was often used around the neckline and hem as a
display of wealth.
