[thumb\|[Supermodel](Supermodel "wikilink") [Gisele

dress](/Image:Gisele_Bundchen2.jpg "wikilink") A **tent dress** is a
[dress](/dress "wikilink") that hangs loose from shoulder to below the
hips, and does not have a
[waistline](/waistline_(clothing) "wikilink").[1] They are worn without
belts.

The tent dress was one of the trends in 2007.[2] They are sold in most
department stores or clothes-carrying supermarkets, and may also be
home-made or tailor-made.

## Design

Tent dresses may be made from a variety of fabrics, including solid,
striped, polka dotted, or floral prints (and sometimes even a
combination), and are often in bright colors which would not normally be
matched (e.g. orange, purple, and neon green). They vary in
[sleeve](/sleeve "wikilink") and dress length, and can be greatly
altered with fringe, lace, buttons (particularly large ones), and other
embellishments such as fake jewels, sequins or glitter. They are usually
long-sleeved, fluffy-sleeved, or [sleeveless](/sleeveless "wikilink").
They are often worn with skinny jeans or
[leggings](/leggings "wikilink"), as many tent dresses are so short as
to leave the crotch visible. They are normally worn as [mini
dresses](/mini_dress "wikilink"); but can be longer, or so short as to
be little different from a shirt.[3]
