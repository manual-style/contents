[thumb\|right\|Arab men wearing thawbs in [Salalah](Salalah "wikilink"),
[Oman](/Oman "wikilink").](/File:Dishdasha.jpg "wikilink") A **thawb**
or **thobe** (), also called a **Qamīṣ** (, is an ankle-length
[garment](/garment "wikilink"), usually with long sleeves, similar to a
[robe](/robe "wikilink"), [kaftan](/kaftan "wikilink") or
[tunic](/tunic "wikilink"). It is commonly worn in the [Arabian
Peninsula](/Arabian_Peninsula "wikilink"), [Iraq](/Iraq "wikilink"),
neighbouring [Arab countries](/Arab_world "wikilink"), the southern
ports and Islands of Iran, and some countries in East and West Africa. A
*[sirwal](/sirwal "wikilink")* or [pants](/pants "wikilink"),
[izaar](/izaar "wikilink") or [lungi](/lungi "wikilink") are typically
worn underneath.

## Background

The word *thawb* is the standard [Arabic](/Arabic "wikilink") word for
'a garment'. It is traditional clothing style for men. It is sometimes
spelled *thobe* or *thaub*. It is a tunic, generally long. The word is
used specifically for this garment in [Arab States of the Persian
Gulf](/Arab_States_of_the_Persian_Gulf "wikilink") and some areas in the
south of [Egypt](/Egypt "wikilink"). There has been some debate
regarding the correct length of the thawb.

## Prevalence

The *thawb* is commonly worn by men in the [Arabian
Peninsula](/Arabian_Peninsula "wikilink"), Iraq, and other [Arab
countries in the Persian
Gulf](/Arab_States_of_the_Persian_Gulf "wikilink"). It is normally made
of [cotton](/cotton "wikilink"), but heavier materials such as
[sheep](/sheep "wikilink")'s [wool](/wool "wikilink") can also be used,
especially in colder climates in Iraq and Syria.[1] The style of the
thawb varies slightly among the various regions within the [Persian Gulf
region](/Arab_states_of_the_Persian_Gulf "wikilink"). The sleeves and
the collar can be stiffened to give a more formal appearance. Other
names may be used for this garment. In [the
Levant](/Bilad_al-Sham "wikilink") and [Oman](/Oman "wikilink"),
*dishdasha* is the most common word for the garment; in the UAE, the
word *kandura* is used. In Morocco, the sleeves tend to be much shorter
so that the thawb may seem more like a long
[T-shirt](/T-shirt "wikilink") and is locally called *gandora*. The neck
also tends to be more open than in its Saudi counterpart and, along with
the breast pocket, is often embroidered. It might also lack
[buttons](/buttons "wikilink") altogether.

The term *thawb* is also used to refer to similar women's garments.[2].
In the lead up to [Independence (1956–present)](/Sudan "wikilink"), new
styles of thobes became fashionable as Sudanese women "expressed their
growing opportunities and desires through fashion."[3] The traditional
Palestinian woman's long tunic is also a thobe. This style originated in
the early 19th century and is richly embroidered, with different colours
and patterns signifying various aspects of the wearer's social
position.[4] Since the Nakba, or [1948 Palestinian
exodus](/1948_Palestinian_exodus "wikilink"), the thobe has also come to
represent Palestinian political identity.[5] Another example is a very
long, oversized woman's garment with a heavily embroidered front panel
and billowing back, also known as a
*[Khaleeji](/Khaleeji_culture "wikilink")* dress, which is most commonly
seen in the West worn for performance of the
[Saudi](/Saudi_Arabia "wikilink") women's social-style dances, in which
manipulation of the large thawb is a key component.

This garment is also known as [Kanzu](/Kanzu "wikilink") in
[Swahili](/Swahili_language "wikilink"), and is commonly worn on the
[Swahili Coast](/Swahili_Coast "wikilink") by
[Swahili](/Swahili_people "wikilink") men.

## Other occasions

A thawb is sometimes worn with a *[bisht](/Bisht_(clothing) "wikilink")*
(), also known in other parts of the [Arabian
Peninsula](/Arabian_Peninsula "wikilink") as a *mishlah* () or *ʿabāʾ*
(), meaning 'cloak'. It is usually worn in ceremonial occasions or by
officials. A bisht is usually worn by religious clergy, but can also be
worn in a wedding, [Eids](/Eid_al-Fitr "wikilink") and funerals. It may
refer to a status of wealth and royalty, or sometimes a religious
position. It was originally manufactured in Syria, Iraq and Jordan, and
it is usually worn in Jordan, Syria, Iraq and the Arabian peninsula.

According to [H. R. P. Dickson](/H._R._P._Dickson "wikilink"),[6]
Bedouin women would mount a brightly coloured thawb on a pole in front
of a tent in order to welcome home a traveller or an important person
coming to visit.[7]

[Rashida Tlaib](/Rashida_Tlaib "wikilink"), a
[Democratic](/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "wikilink") member of the
[United States House of
Representatives](/United_States_House_of_Representatives "wikilink")
from [Michigan](/Michigan "wikilink") and the first Palestinian-American
woman elected to that body, wore a thawb to her swearing-in ceremony on
January 3, 2019.[8] This inspired a number of Palestinian and
Palestinian-American women to share pictures on social media with the
[hashtag](/hashtag "wikilink") #TweetYourThobe.[9]
