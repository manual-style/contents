**Trabea** (plural *trabeae*) is the name of various pieces of
[Roman](Ancient_Rome "wikilink") clothing. A distinct feature of all
trabeae was their color - usually in red or
[purple](Tyrian_purple "wikilink"). They were formed like a
[toga](toga "wikilink") and possibly in some cases like a [mantle
piece](Mantle_(clothing) "wikilink") and worn by more distinguished
members of Roman society.

Such clothing, known as the *[trabea
triumphalis](Roman_triumph "wikilink")* was worn commonly by
[consuls](Roman_consul "wikilink") in [Late
Antiquity](Late_Antiquity "wikilink"). When Emperor [Justinian
II](Justinian_II "wikilink") formally abolished the title of *consul* as
a separate entity from the Emperor himself, the *trabea triumphalis* was
developed into the *[loros](loros "wikilink")*, which was the worn by
the imperial family and senior administrative officials only. When
emperor [Leo VI](Leo_VI_the_Wise "wikilink") formally abolished the
ancient title of consul altogether, the loros persisted until the [end
of the empire](Fall_of_Constantinople "wikilink") as formal, ceremonial
[dress](Byzantine_dress "wikilink") of the emperors
