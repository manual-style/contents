A **wrap dress** is a [dress](/dress "wikilink") with a front closure
formed by wrapping one side across the other, and knotting the attached
ties that wrap around the back at the waist or fastening buttons. This
forms a V-shaped neckline and hugs the wearer's curves. A **faux wrap
dress** resembles this design, except that it comes already fastened
together with no opening in front, but instead is slipped on over the
head. A **wrap top** is a [top](/Top_(clothing) "wikilink") cut and
constructed in the same way as a wrap dress, but without a skirt.

## History

[thumb\|left\|100px\|1960s wrap dress: the navy bindings highlight the
wrap-over.](/File:Till_boken_-_utställningen_Kunglig_Vintage_-_Livrustkammaren_-_87644.tif "wikilink")
Although it is often claimed that [Diane von
Fürstenberg](/Diane_von_Fürstenberg "wikilink") 'invented' the wrap
dress in 1972/73,[1] [Richard
Martin](/Richard_Martin_(curator) "wikilink"), a former curator of the
[Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art](/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art#The_Costume_Institute "wikilink"),
noted that the form of Fürstenberg's design had already been "deeply
embedded into the American designer
[sportswear](/sportswear_(fashion) "wikilink") tradition," with her
choice of elastic, synthetic fabrics distinguishing her work from
earlier wrap dresses.[2] During the Great Depression, house dresses
called "Hooverettes" were popular which employed a wrap design. Wrap
dresses were designed by [Elsa
Schiaparelli](/Elsa_Schiaparelli "wikilink") in the 1930s[3][4] and by
[Claire McCardell](/Claire_McCardell "wikilink") in the 1940s, whose
original '[popover](/popover_(dress) "wikilink")' design became the
basis for a variety of wrap-around dresses.[5]

The Fürstenberg interpretation of the wrap dress, which was consistently
knee-length, in a clinging [jersey](/jersey_(fabric) "wikilink"), with
long sleeves, was so popular and so distinctive that the style has
generally become associated with her.[6][7][8] She has stated that her
divorce inspired the design,[9] and also suggested it was created in the
spirit of enabling women to enjoy sexual freedom.[10] In 2004 a book
dedicated entirely to Fürstenberg's wrap dresses was published.[11]

Wrap dresses achieved their peak of popularity in the mid to late 1970s,
and the design has been credited with becoming a symbol of [women's
liberation](/women's_liberation "wikilink") in the 1970s.[12][13] They
experienced renewed popularity beginning in the late 1990s, particularly
after von Fürstenberg reintroduced her wrap dress in 1997; she, among
others, has continued to design wrap dresses since then.[14][15] The
wrap dress's popularity and its perceived
[feminist](/feminist "wikilink") significance have remained current into
the mid-2010s.[16]
