![](Nigerian_women.jpg "fig:Nigerian_women.jpg") The **wrapper**,
**lappa**, or **pagne** is a colorful garment widely worn in [West
Africa](West_Africa "wikilink") by both men and women. It has formal and
informal versions and varies from simple draped clothing to fully
tailored ensembles. The formality of the wrapper depends on the fabric
used to create it.

## West African kaftan/boubou

In [West Africa](West_Africa "wikilink"), a [kaftan](kaftan "wikilink")
or *caftan* is a pull-over woman's [robe](robe "wikilink").[1] In
French, this robe is called a [boubou](Boubou_(clothing) "wikilink"),
pronounced *boo-boo*. The boubou is the traditional female attire in
many West African countries including [Senegal](Senegal "wikilink"),
[Mali](Mali "wikilink") and other countries. The boubou can be formal or
informal attire. The formality of the kaftan depends upon the fabric
used to create it.

## Yoruba iro

In [Yorubaland](Yorubaland "wikilink"), [Nigeria](Nigeria "wikilink")
the wrapper is common, called an *iro* in the [Yoruba
language](Yoruba_language "wikilink"), pronounced *i-roh*. The wrapper
is usually worn with a matching [headscarf](headscarf "wikilink") or
[head tie](head_tie "wikilink") that is called a *gele* in Yoruba,
pronounced *geh-leh*.[2] A full wrapper ensemble consists of three
garments, a [blouse](blouse "wikilink"), called a *buba*, pronounced
*boo-bah* the iro and a [headscarf](headscarf "wikilink") called a [head
tie](head_tie "wikilink") in English and a gele in Yoruba. Traditional
male attire is called a agbada. A wrapper takes metres of quality
[fabric](textile "wikilink").

## Pagne

**Pagne** () designates a certain cut (two by six yards) and type
(single-sided "Fancy" or double-sided "wax" prints) of untailored cotton
textile,[3] especially in Francophone West and Central Africa.[4]
Enormously popular in much of tropical Africa, the pagne cloth's usage
and patterns may be used to convey by the wearer a number of social,
economic—and sometimes even political—messages.[5] It is similar—though
distinct in size, expected pattern, and usage—to the
[Khanga](Khanga "wikilink"), [Kikoy](Kikoy "wikilink") or
[Chitenge](Chitenge "wikilink") of East and Southern Africa. From the
pagne any number of garments may be created (the
[boubou](Boubou_(clothing) "wikilink"), dresses, or western style suits)
or it can be used untailored as a wrap, headtie, skirt, or tied as a
sling for children or goods. The word pagne, likely derived from the
Latin *pannum*, was a term introduced by merchants from the 16th Century
and adopted by several African societies to identify often pre-existing
textiles or garments distinct from a simple cloth. The Portuguese *pano*
for *cloth* has become the French *pagne* (*loincloth*), Dutch *paan*,
and others.[6] It appears to have originally referred to East Asian
textiles traded in East and West Africa, before becoming a term for a
certain length (a yard, later two by six yards) of commercial printed
cloth sold in coastal West Africa.[7][8][9][10]

## In the West

In the UK and North America, a **wrapper** is also an older term for an
informal house garment. Today, words such as *housecoat* and *bathrobe*
(US) or *dressing gown* (UK) are usually employed instead.

## Informal fabrics

![](NW_Folklife_2008_-_dancer_and_drummers_02.jpg "NW_Folklife_2008_-_dancer_and_drummers_02.jpg")

-   [Batik](Batik "wikilink")—created with hot wax and dye.
-   [Fancy print](Fancy_print "wikilink")—created by printing patterns
    on cloth. Unlike expensive wax prints, the design is printed on one
    side of the cotton fabric. Fancy prints are made in
    [Europe](Europe "wikilink"), [India](India "wikilink"), and [West
    Africa](West_Africa "wikilink"). The most popular fancy print is
    known as the *traditional print*.
-   [Kente](Kente "wikilink")—traditionally woven by men. Kente is an
    informal fabric for anyone who is not a member of the [Akan
    people](Akan_people "wikilink"). For Akans and many Ewes, kente is a
    formal cloth.
-   [Mudcloth](Mudcloth "wikilink")—created by making mud drawings on
    cotton.
-   [Tie-dye](Tie-dye "wikilink")—made by resist tying cotton then
    dipping in dye. In [Nigeria](Nigeria "wikilink"), tie-dye is known
    as *[adire](Adire_(textile_art) "wikilink")* cloth.

## Formal fabrics

-   [Aso Oke fabric](Aso_Oke_fabric "wikilink")—Woven by men, see
    [Yoruba people](Yoruba_people "wikilink").
-   [Cotton](Cotton "wikilink") brocade—most brocade is produced in
    [Guinea](Guinea "wikilink"). Brocade is a shiny and polished cotton
    fabric.
-   [George cloth](George_cloth "wikilink")—George cloth originated in
    [India](India "wikilink"), where it was used to make
    [saris](sari "wikilink"). The fabric became popular among African
    royal and noble families. The [Ijaw
    people](Ijaw_people "wikilink")[11] are known for their George
    wrappers.[12]
-   [Lace](Lace "wikilink")—also known as ''shain-shain cloth'.
-   [Linen](Linen "wikilink")—linen kaftans are a formal style.
-   [Satin](Satin "wikilink")—satin fabrics are suitable for [formal
    wear](formal_wear "wikilink").[13]
-   [African wax prints](African_wax_prints "wikilink")—traditional
    cloths in Africa. Most of them are printed in West Africa and China.
    Some African waxprints are made in the
    [Netherlands](Netherlands "wikilink"), known as *Dutch wax*. In
    earlier times these were also produced in Great Britain. In a wax
    print, the pattern or design is printed on both sides of the cotton
    fabric. Waxprints are more expensive than fancy prints. Famous
    manufacturers are Vlisco in the Netherlands, Akosombo Textiles
    Limited in Ghana and Hitarget in China. Some smaller companies still
    produce genuine African wax prints. A well known brand is ABC Wax
    from Manchester, UK. Today ABC Wax is part of Akosombo Textiles
    Limited and printed in Ghana. There are many companies in Africa and
    China which use the wax print design for similar looking and much
    cheaper fancy textiles.

## Wedding attire

![](Senegal1974-27.jpg "fig:Senegal1974-27.jpg"), West Africa in
1974.\]\]

The kaftan is always worn with a [headscarf](headscarf "wikilink") or
[head tie](head_tie "wikilink"). During a [wedding](wedding "wikilink")
ceremony, the bride's kaftan is the same color as the groom's
[dashiki](dashiki "wikilink"). The traditional color for West African
weddings is white.[14] The most popular non-traditional color is purple
or lavender, the color of African royalty.[15] Blue, the color of love,
is also a common non-traditional color.[16] Most women wear black
kaftans to [funerals](funeral "wikilink").[17] However, in some parts of
[Ghana](Ghana "wikilink") and the [United
States](United_States "wikilink"), some women wear black-and-white
prints, or black and red. The kaftan is the most popular attire for
women of [African descent](African_descent "wikilink") throughout the
[African diaspora](African_diaspora "wikilink"). African and
African-American women wear a wide variety of dresses, and skirt sets
made out of formal fabrics as [formal wear](formal_wear "wikilink").
However, the kaftan and wrapper are the two traditional choices. It is
not uncommon for a woman to wear a white [wedding
dress](wedding_dress "wikilink") when the groom wears African attire. In
the [United States](United_States "wikilink"),
[African-American](African-American "wikilink") women wear the boubou
for special occasions. The kaftan or boubou is worn at
[weddings](wedding "wikilink"); [funerals](funeral "wikilink");
[graduations](graduation "wikilink"); and [Kwanzaa](Kwanzaa "wikilink")
celebrations.

The men's robe is also called a boubou, see [Senegalese
kaftan](Senegalese_kaftan "wikilink") for further information.[18]

## Buba

A **buba** (pronounced *boo-bah*) is a [top](Top_(clothing) "wikilink")
or [blouse](blouse "wikilink"). Buba is a
[Yoruba](Yoruba_people "wikilink") word that means the upper clothing.
For women, the buba is worn with the iro which means wrapper and gele
which means head tie. For men, it worn with sokoto which means trousers
and fila which means hat. The buba, sokoto/iro and fila/gele set is the
traditional costume of the [Yoruba people](Yoruba_people "wikilink") in
South Western Nigeria.
