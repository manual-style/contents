[Mamadou Tandja](Mamadou_Tandja "wikilink") wearing a grand boubou\]\]

**Agbada** is one of the names for a flowing wide-sleeved robe worn by
men in much of [West Africa](West_Africa "wikilink"), and to a lesser
extent in [North Africa](North_Africa "wikilink"), related to the
[dashiki](dashiki "wikilink") suit.

The garments is known by various names in different ethnic groups and
languages that adopted it from the original **babban riga** of the
[Hausa People](Hausa_people "wikilink"), called **agbada** in
[Yoruba](Yoruba_people "wikilink"), **boubou** from
[Wolof](Wolof_language "wikilink") mbubb, **mbubb** in Wolof, **k'sa**
or **gandora** in [Tuareg](Tuareg_people "wikilink"), **darra'a** in
[Maghrebi Arabic](Maghrebi_Arabic "wikilink"), **grand boubou** in
various [French-speaking](Francophone "wikilink") West African countries
and the English term **gown**.

The **[Senegalese](Senegalese "wikilink") boubou**, a variation on the
*grand boubou* described below, is also known as the **[Senegalese
kaftan](Senegalese_kaftan "wikilink")**. The female version worn in some
communities is also known as a **m'boubou** or **kaftan** or
**[wrapper](Wrapper_(clothing) "wikilink")**.

## History

Its origin lies with the clothing style of the
[Hausa](Hausa_people "wikilink") nobility and subsequently neighbouring
[Songhai peoples](Songhai_people "wikilink") of the 12th and
13th-century [Mali](Mali_Empire "wikilink") and [Songhai
Empires](Songhai_Empire "wikilink"). The use of the babban riga as
clothing became widespread throughout the West African region with the
migration of [Hausa](Hausa_people "wikilink") long distance traders and
Islamic preachers in and around Muslim regions of west Africa in the
1500s and even more rapidly after the Fulani Jihad of the 19th century.

## Use

Agbada is usually decorated with intricate embroidery, and is worn on
special religious or ceremonial occasions, such as the two Islamic
[Eid](Muslim_holidays "wikilink") festivals, weddings, funerals or for
attending the [Mosque](Mosque "wikilink") for [Friday
prayer](Friday_prayer "wikilink"). It has become the formal attire of
many countries in West Africa. Older robes have become family heirlooms
passed on from father to son and are worn as status symbols.

There are female versions of the agbada style in
[Mali](Mali "wikilink"), [Senegal](Senegal "wikilink"),
[Gambia](Gambia "wikilink"), [Guinea](Guinea "wikilink"),
[Mauritania](Mauritania "wikilink") and many other West African
countries. An alternative female formal version of the boubou is also
called the [wrapper](Wrapper_(clothing) "wikilink").

## Clothing

Agbada as a full formal attire consists of three pieces of clothing: a
pair of tie-up trousers that narrow towards the ankles (known as a
ṣokoto pronounced "shokoto" in [Yoruba](Yoruba_language "wikilink")), a
long-sleeved shirt and a wide, open-stitched sleeveless gown worn over
these. The three pieces are generally of the same colour. It is made
from cotton and richly embroidered in traditional patters. However,
modern Yoruba make the Agbada from synthetic cloths that resemble silk
in stark contrast to its cotton origins.

## Method of wearing

There is a set etiquette to wearing the grand boubou, primarily in place
to keep the over-gown above the ankles at any one time, in keeping with
Islamic traditions of avoiding impurity (see [Najis](Najis "wikilink")).
This can include folding the open sleeves of the boubou over one's
shoulders, normally done while walking or before sitting down, to ensure
the over-gown does not rub against the ground, or by folding/wrapping
each side over the other with the hand, narrowing the gown's space
toward the ankles (as done by the [Tuareg](Tuareg_people "wikilink")
people). Thus, it is rare to see the grand boubou's square-shaped gown
completely unwrapped.

## Popularity

Use of agbada was historically limited to various Islamised
[Sahelian](Sahel "wikilink") and [Saharan](Sahara "wikilink") peoples of
West Africa, but through increased trade and the spread of Islam
throughout the region, it gained use among peoples in the
[savanna](savanna "wikilink") and forested regions of West Africa.
Through this, the agbada was historically worn by chiefs of the
[Yoruba](Yoruba_people "wikilink") of Nigeria,
[Dagomba](Dagomba_people "wikilink") of Ghana, the
[Mandinka](Mandinka_people "wikilink") of the Gambia, the
[Susu](Susu_people "wikilink") of Guinea and the
[Temnes](Temne_people "wikilink") of Sierra Leone.

Today, Agbada has gained popularity as a fashionable form of attire
among wide classes of people in West Africa, the [African
diaspora](African_diaspora "wikilink"), and very recently, even among
[Bantu](Bantu_peoples "wikilink") people in
[East](East_Africa "wikilink"), [Southern](Southern_Africa "wikilink")
and [Central Africa](Central_Africa "wikilink").

### Gender differences

Although usually a form of men's clothing, women's traditional clothing
in much of Sahelian West Africa is of similar construction, though
usually worn differently. In some places these are called the
*m'boubou*. In other regions of West Africa, the female formal clothing
has been a boubou variant, called a kaftan, and in other places it is
the [wrapper](Wrapper_(clothing) "wikilink") and
[headscarf](headscarf "wikilink").
