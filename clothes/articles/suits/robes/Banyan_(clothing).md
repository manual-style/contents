A **banyan** (through [Portuguese](Portuguese_language "wikilink")
*banian* and [Arabic](Arabic_language "wikilink") , *banyān*, from the
[Gujarati](Gujarati_language "wikilink") , *vāṇiyo*, meaning "merchant")
is a [garment](clothing "wikilink") worn by
[European](Europe "wikilink") men and women in the late 17th and 18th
century, influenced by the [Japanese](Japan "wikilink")
[kimonos](kimono "wikilink") brought to Europe by the [Dutch East India
Company](Dutch_East_India_Company "wikilink") in the mid-17th
century.[1] Banyan is also commonly used in present-day [Indian
English](Indian_English "wikilink") and other countries in the [Indian
Subcontinent](Indian_Subcontinent "wikilink") to mean "vest"
("[undershirt](undershirt "wikilink")" in American English, "singlet" in
Australian English).

Also called a **morning gown**, ***robe de chambre*** or **nightgown**,
the banyan was a loose, T-shaped or kimono-like garment of
[cotton](cotton "wikilink"), [linen](linen "wikilink"), or
[silk](silk "wikilink") [gown](gown "wikilink") worn at home as a sort
of [dressing gown](robe "wikilink") or informal
[coat](coat_(clothing) "wikilink") over the shirt and breeches. The
typical banyan was cut *en chemise*, with the sleeves and body cut as
one piece. It was usually paired with a soft,
[turban](turban "wikilink")-like cap worn in place of the formal
[periwig](Wig_(hair) "wikilink"). An alternative style of banyan was cut
like a coat, fitted, with set-in sleeves, and was closed with buttons
and buttonholes.[2]

## Wearing the banyan

European women wore banyans in the 18th century as dressing gowns in the
morning, before robing for the day, or in the evening before bed over
undergarments, as described by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London,
England.[3]

In the humid climate of [Colonial Virginia](Virginia_Colony "wikilink"),
gentlemen wore lightweight banyans as informal street wear in summer.

It was fashionable for men of an intellectual or philosophical bent to
have their [portraits](portraits "wikilink") painted while wearing
banyans. [Benjamin Rush](Benjamin_Rush "wikilink") wrote:

> Loose dresses contribute to the easy and vigorous exercise of the
> faculties of the mind. This remark is so obvious, and so generally
> known, that we find studious men are always painted in gowns, when
> they are seated in their libraries.[4]

Despite the name "nightgown", the banyan was not worn for sleeping.
