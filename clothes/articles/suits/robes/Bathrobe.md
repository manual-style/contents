A **bathrobe**, **dressing gown**, **housecoat** or **morning gown** is
a [robe](robe "wikilink"), a loose-fitting outer
[garment](clothing "wikilink"), worn by either men or women. A dressing
gown may be worn over [nightwear](nightwear "wikilink") or other
clothing, or with nothing underneath. Dressing gowns are typically worn
around the house and bathrobes may sometimes be worn after a body wash
or around a pool. They may be worn for warmth, as a convenient covering
over nightwear when not being in bed, or as a form of
[lingerie](lingerie "wikilink"). When guests or other visitors are
expected to enter the household while the host/s are partially dressed
or undressed, the hosts may put on additional clothing, such as a
dressing gown. A dressing gown or a housecoat is a loose, open-fronted
[gown](gown "wikilink") closed with a fabric belt that is put on over
nightwear on rising from bed, or, less commonly today, worn over some
day clothes when partially dressed or undressed in the morning or
evening (for example, over a man's shirt and trousers without jacket and
tie). A bathrobe is a dressing gown made from towelling or other
absorbent fabric and may be donned while the wearer's body is wet,
serving both as a [towel](towel "wikilink") and a body covering.

The regular wearing of a dressing gown by men about the house is derived
from the 18th-century wearing of the
*[banyan](banyan_(clothing) "wikilink")* in
[orientalist](orientalism "wikilink") imitation.[1] The
[Japanese](Japanese_clothing "wikilink") *[yukata](yukata "wikilink")*
is an unlined, cotton [kimono](kimono "wikilink") worn as a bathrobe or
as summer outdoor clothing.

## Styles of fabrics

Bathrobes are generally made of four different fabrics:[2]

-   **Cotton:** [Cotton](Cotton "wikilink") is a natural fibre
    consisting primarily of [cellulose](cellulose "wikilink") and is one
    of the most commonly used fibres in textile manufacturing. Due to
    the [hydrophilic](hydrophile "wikilink") nature of cellulose, cotton
    absorbs water easily and is frequently used by the beach, pool, or
    following a shower. Cotton robes are especially suited to use in hot
    climates because cotton tends to absorb
    [perspiration](perspiration "wikilink").
-   **Silk:** [Silk](Silk "wikilink") dressing gowns are popular because
    of their look and feel, but can be relatively expensive. Silk robes
    are very thin and lightweight, and are not particularly suited to
    wet situations because they lack the surface area and polarity
    necessary to absorb water.[3] However, silk dressing gowns are the
    traditional choice, since they are not worn after bathing.
-   **Microfiber:** [Microfiber](Microfiber "wikilink") is an extremely
    fine [synthetic fiber](synthetic_fiber "wikilink"), typically made
    of cellulose or polyester, that can be woven into textiles to mimic
    natural-fiber cloth. Modern microfibers are developed to maximize
    breathability and water absorption and can be thinner than the width
    of human hair. Much like silk, robes made out of microfiber are
    light in weight and are very soft to the touch. Microfiber is
    [flammable](flammable "wikilink").
-   **Wool:** [Wool](Wool "wikilink") bathrobes are common in colder
    climates.
-   **Nylon:** [Nylon](Nylon "wikilink") is a synthetic fibre
    occasionally used in inexpensive dressing gowns. It is valued for
    its ability to be cleaned easily.

## Styles of weave

Bathrobes are also categorized by their shape of weave:

-   **Flannel:** [Flannel](Flannel "wikilink") is a soft woven fabric,
    made from loosely spun yarn, usually cotton or wool.
-   **Terry:** [Terry](Terrycloth "wikilink") is a pile fabric, usually
    woven of cotton, with uncut loops on both sides, used for bath
    towels and robes. The longer and denser the loops are, the more
    absorbent the bathrobes are.
-   **Velour:** [Velour](Velour "wikilink") is a fabric with cut loops.
    Velour bathrobes are typically made with terry inside, as terrycloth
    absorbs water better than velour. Velour gives the bathrobe luxury,
    cosiness, and makes the garment softer to the touch.
-   **Waffle:** [Waffle fabric](Waffle_fabric "wikilink") has good water
    absorbency, is loose and has a distinctive "gridlike" appearance.
    For the most part, these bathrobes are designed for their light
    weight. "Pique" is a type of waffle weave that can be applied to
    cotton, velour, silk, and other fabrics.

## Styles of collars

for the Western market, late 19th - early 20th century.\]\] There are
varieties of collars for bathrobes:

-   **Shawl collar:** So called because the collar closes about the neck
    just like a shawl. The shawl collar is borrowed from its use on
    men's evening wear, the [dinner jacket](dinner_jacket "wikilink")
    and [smoking jacket](smoking_jacket "wikilink"), and is common on
    traditional dressing gowns.
-   **Kimono:** This is a traditional Japanese garment and the name
    literally translates to ‘thing to wear’.[4] The
    [kimono](kimono "wikilink") style robe actually has no collar *per
    se*.
-   **Hooded:** A hood is sewn into the neckline, which can be worn over
    the head to keep it warm and help dry wet hair.

## Styles of sculpture

The sculpture refers to the texture or styling of the bathrobe's fabric.
The sculpture of a robe not only provides aesthetic appeal but also
affects the absorbency and the hang of the item. The sculpture is a
pattern sewn into the terry cloth, velour, or other fabric that reduces
bulk, increases suppleness, and yields a more graceful hang on thicker
styles. There are several varieties of fabric sculptures for robes:

-   **Window Pane:** A box or checkerboard pattern in various sizes
-   **Zig Zag:** A plush, repeating "Z" pattern
-   **Ribbed:** A sculpture design that yields alternating vertical
    lines of plush material and sewn material
-   **Waves:** Similar to the Zig Zag sculpture, but with gentler angles

## Design

Each bathrobe has been differently designed with the collar and waist
main features.

Most robes are fitted with a belt that ties looped through the waist to
fit all sizes. A popular style is a kimono relaxed collar, as is the
shawl design too, but it all depends on how you like to be covered:

-   **Long Bath:** Terry bathrobe
-   **Pure:** Organic robe
-   **Relaxed:** Linen robe
-   **Easy Care:** Lightweight bamboo robe
-   **Bamboo:** Bamboo cotton fiber
