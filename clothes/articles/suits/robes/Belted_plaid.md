![](GrantPiper.JPG "fig:GrantPiper.JPG"), 1714. The pattern of the
piper's **belted plaid** differs from any modern Grant
[tartan](tartan "wikilink").\]\] The **belted plaid** (or a plaid worn
belted) is a large blanket-like piece of fabric which is wrapped around
the body with the material pleated or, more accurately, loosely gathered
and secured at the waist by means of a belt. Typically, a portion of the
belted plaid hangs down to about the knees (for men) or ankles (for
women) with the rest of the material being wrapped up around the upper
body in a variety of ways and pinned or otherwise secured to keep it in
place.

The belted plaid was a standard item of men's [Highland
dress](Highland_dress "wikilink") from the late 16th century until the
middle of the 18th century. It was also the precursor of the modern
tailored [kilt](kilt "wikilink").

The word *plaide* in Gaelic roughly means [blanket](blanket "wikilink"),
and that was the original term for the garment. The belted plaid has
been and is often referred to by a variety of different terms, including
*féileadh-mór*, *breacán an fhéilidh*, and very commonly, the "Great
Kilt", however the garment was most definitely *not* known by the name
"Great Kilt" during the years when it was in common use.[1]

Both the terms *féileadh-mór* and *breacan an fhéilidh* are
[Gaelic](Scottish_Gaelic_language "wikilink") terms, the former meaning
roughly "large wrap" and the latter roughly meaning "tartan wrap".
Women's ankle-length belted plaids are called *earasaidean*.

## Description and History

or women's belted plaid;*earasaidean'' were typically striped in dun
colours. Published 1845.\]\]
![](Belted_plaids_worn_in_the_Highlands_of_Scotland.jpg "fig:Belted_plaids_worn_in_the_Highlands_of_Scotland.jpg")
The belted plaid consisted of a piece of [tartan](tartan "wikilink")
fabric approximately 4–5 yards in length and about 50–60 inches wide.
Since the weaving [looms](loom "wikilink") in those years wove fabric in
25–30 inch widths, the actual item was generally constructed from
8–10 yards of such single-width fabric by stitching two 25–30 inch
pieces together to get the 50–60 inch width.

It was typically worn as a kind of mantle or [cloak](cloak "wikilink")
cast about the shoulders. In the latter part of the 16th century, some
in the [Highlands of Scotland](Highlands_of_Scotland "wikilink") began
putting a belt around their waist on the outside of the plaid, after
first pleating or gathering the fabric.

### Documentary evidence

The first clear reference to the belted plaid occurs in the year 1594.
In that year, a group of Highlanders from the [Western
Isles](Western_Isles "wikilink") went to [Ireland](Ireland "wikilink")
to fight under [Red Hugh O'Donnell](Hugh_Roe_O'Donnell "wikilink").
Writing about them, Lughaidh noted how they could be distinguished from
the Irish soldiers:

> "They were recognized among the Irish soldiers by the distinction of
> their arms and clothing ... for their exterior dress was mottled
> cloaks of many colours ..., their belts were over their loins outside
> their cloaks."

A surviving woman's plaid dated 1726 exists ([reconstruction,
displayed](http://www.albanach.org/terminology.html) worn as an
[earasaid](earasaid "wikilink")).[2]

A surviving men's belted plaid from 1822 has a horizontal seam and small
[belt loops](drawstring "wikilink") sewn across it at each pattern
repeat,[3] such that it could be rapidly pleated with a drawstring, or
flattened entirely into a blanket.[4]

### Cloth

The belted plaid was made from [wool](wool "wikilink") or a wool /
[linen](linen "wikilink") combination and [twill](twill "wikilink"),
often woven in a pattern of coloured stripes in one or both directions.
This gave a pattern of stripes or checks. The latter has today become
known as [tartan](tartan "wikilink"), though originally the word tartan
referred to the type of cloth used, and not the pattern of colours, as
the word almost exclusively signifies today.

These tartan patterns (or [Setts](Sett_(textiles) "wikilink")) were
apparently chosen based on a sense of fashion or the availability and
expense of [natural dyes](natural_dye "wikilink") in the area of
manufacture. The modern notion of "[clan
tartans](Tartan#Clan_tartans "wikilink")" whereby each
[clan](clan "wikilink") or name is associated with a particular design
did not exist at that time, but instead dates back to the early 19th
century.[5]

### Customary use

The belted plaid was used not only as a garment, but also as bedding at
night, the wearer wrapping himself in it and sleeping directly on the
ground.

During the years preceding the [Battle of
Culloden](Battle_of_Culloden "wikilink"), to the extent that Highlanders
wore any kind of kilt-like garment, it was the belted plaid and not the
modern tailored kilt.[6]

## The kilt at Highland Games

At nearly every Highland Games gathering there are vendors selling
tartan items, whether tailored kilts, blankets, scarves, ties, or tartan
fabric. By far the greatest proportion of their sales in the category of
Highland dress are related to "modern" Highland attire, especially the
modern tailored kilt and its accessories. Yet the belted plaid is seldom
seen today at gatherings of highlanders, and even knowledge of this
garment is not widespread.

The *present-day* Highland Games trace their origins back to the early
19th century interest in matters related to Highland culture. This
interest manifested itself in various reconstructionist events
purportedly designed as a celebration of that earlier Gaelic Highland
and [Celtic](Celt "wikilink") culture, but such cultures never wore
garments like the modern tailored kilt.

The modern short kilt is called *féileadh beag* ("little wrap"), and
often Anglicized to philabeg or filibeg, with various spellings. Its
origins are still debated; what is clear is that the philabeg developed
from the belted plaid sometime in the early 18th century, or perhaps
somewhat earlier. The philabeg consisted essentially of the lower half
of a plaid, gathered or pleated and held around the waist with a belt.
Later, the gatherings were stitched down to hold them in place, and thus
originated the modern tailored kilt.

Some speculate the modern "sport / half-plaid kilt" was derived from
miners, or fashion, due to it being half the cost of a full belted
plaid, whereupon one can choose either a [fly
plaid](fly_plaid "wikilink") or not. This would have helped at the
[Battle of the Shirts](Battle_of_the_Shirts "wikilink").
