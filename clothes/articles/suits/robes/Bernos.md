**Bernos** (also transliterated **Barnos**, **Burnos**) is a
[wool](wool "wikilink") [cloak](cloak "wikilink")-like garment and hood
woven in one piece, worn by [Ethiopian](Ethiopia "wikilink") and
[Eritrean](Eritrea "wikilink") highlanders. The term seems to be an
adaptation of the [Maghrebi](Maghreb "wikilink") version of
[Burnous](Burnous "wikilink"). [Donald N.
Levine](Donald_N._Levine "wikilink") notes that the wealthier men of
[Menz](Menz "wikilink") "wear the *barnos*, a tailored cape made of dark
wool."[1]

The bernos was frequently worn by the elite highlanders. Today, average
citizens sometimes wear it in traditional ceremonies and at special
occasions. Social status is indicated by the garment's decorative
pattern.
