    It is a flowing outer cloak worn over a *[thawb](thawb "wikilink")*.
    It is usually black, brown, beige, cream or grey in colour. A bisht
    is usually worn for prestige on special occasions such as weddings,
    or festivals such as [Eid](Eid_ul-Fitr "wikilink"), or for [Jumʿah
    prayers](Jumu'ah "wikilink"). In [Iraq](Iraq "wikilink") it is worn
    by tribal chiefs.

The bisht is also worn by [East African](East_Africa "wikilink")
nobility, including tribal chiefs, kings, and imams, over a
[kanzu](kanzu "wikilink") or tunic.

## Etymology

Some theorize that word ‘bisht’ is derived from Persian word *‘posht’*
() meaning ‘back’, as the bisht worn from back, though this is disputed.
It was widely used in [Semitic
civilization](Ancient_Semitic-speaking_peoples "wikilink"), and an
alternate theory is that the word *bisht* is derived from
[Akkadian](Akkadian_language "wikilink") *‘bishtu’*, meaning ‘nobility’
or ‘dignity’.[1] The alternate name of *ʿabāʾ* () is from the Arabic
[triliteral root](Semitic_root "wikilink")
*[ʿAyn](Ayin#Arabic "wikilink")-[Bāʾ](Bet_(letter)#Arabic_bāʾ "wikilink")-[Wāw](Waw_(letter)#Arabic_wāw "wikilink")*,
which relates to 'filling out'.
