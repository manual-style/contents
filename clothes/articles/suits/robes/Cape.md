sleeveless topcoat, common with [Highland
dress](Highland_dress "wikilink").\]\]
![](Milano_Italy_Carabinieri-01.jpg "fig:Milano_Italy_Carabinieri-01.jpg")
(gendarmes) with capes\]\] A **cape** is a sleeveless [outer
garment](outer_garment "wikilink"), which drapes the wearer's back,
arms, and chest, and connects at the neck.

## History

![](PazyrikHorseman.JPG "fig:PazyrikHorseman.JPG") horseman wearing cape
300 BCE\]\] Capes were common in [medieval
Europe](medieval_Europe "wikilink"), especially when combined with a
[hood](Hood_(headgear) "wikilink") in the
[chaperon](Chaperon_(headgear) "wikilink"), and have had periodic
returns to [fashion](fashion "wikilink"), for example, in
nineteenth-century Europe. [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "wikilink")
[clergy](clergy "wikilink") wear a type of cape known as a
[ferraiolo](ferraiolo "wikilink"), which is worn for formal events
outside a ritualistic context. The [cope](cope "wikilink") is a
liturgical [vestment](vestment "wikilink") in the form of a cape. Capes
are often highly decorated with elaborate embroidery. Capes remain in
regular use as rainwear in various [military](military "wikilink") units
and [police](police "wikilink") forces, in France for example. A **gas
cape** was a voluminous military garment designed to give rain
protection to someone wearing the bulky [gas masks](gas_mask "wikilink")
used in twentieth-century wars.

## Semantic distinction

![](Pelerine1911.jpg "fig:Pelerine1911.jpg") In fashion, the word
***“cape”***usually refers to a shorter garment
and***“[cloak](cloak "wikilink")”*** to a full-length version of the
different types of garment, though the two terms are sometimes used
synonymously for full-length coverings. The fashion cape does not cover
the front to any appreciable degree. In raingear, a cape is usually a
long and roomy protective garment worn to keep one dry in the rain.

## Use in formal wear

In full [evening dress](Evening_gown "wikilink"),
[ladies](lady "wikilink") frequently use the cape as a [fashion
statement](fashion_statement "wikilink"), or to protect the wearer or
the fine [fabrics](Textile "wikilink") of their
[evening-wear](ballgown "wikilink") from the elements, especially where
a [coat](coat_(clothing) "wikilink") would crush—or hide—the garment.
These capes may be short (over the shoulders or to the waist) or a
full-length cloak. Short capes were usually made of, or trimmed in,
[fur](fur "wikilink"); however, because fur is less accepted as a
fashion accessory in modern times, other expensive materials are
substituted for it, with an opulent [lining](lining_(sewing) "wikilink")
and trim. Typical fabrics used are [velvet](velvet "wikilink"),
[silk](silk "wikilink"), and [satin](satin "wikilink"). Capes are still
authorized as an alternative to the more utilitarian [trench
coat](trench_coat "wikilink") for [U.S. Army](U.S._Army "wikilink")
officers in [mess dress](mess_dress "wikilink"), formal evening uniform.

## The caped overcoat variant

Caped overcoats were popular for men during the Victorian era, with some
caped [Ulsters](Ulster_coat "wikilink") featuring multiple layered
capes, and the [Inverness coat](Inverness_coat "wikilink") (both formal
evening and working day variants) had a cape.[1] The Inverness coat is
no longer commonly worn (though it has begun to be revived, on a limited
scale, in [steampunk](steampunk "wikilink") fashion), and the Ulster
lost its cape in the 1920s.

## As protection

In modern times, capes are commonly used by hair and beauty salons for
the purpose of hair styling services, in which usage they protect
clothing from loose strands of hair being cut from the head and/or from
the chemicals often used in such styling.[2]

## In fiction

![](Batman_and_Robin_1966.JPG "Batman_and_Robin_1966.JPG")

The cape is a popular clothing item for
[superheroes](superhero "wikilink") like [Superman](Superman "wikilink")
in the [American comic book](American_comic_book "wikilink") genre. They
are often used by comic book artists to create the illusion of motion in
a still image. Most often, they are worn merely as a costume adornment.
Other times, as in the case of [Batman](Batman "wikilink"), [The
Shroud](Shroud_(comics) "wikilink"), and [Cloak of Cloak &
Dagger](Cloak_and_Dagger_(comics) "wikilink"), the cape serves a
functional purpose, such as gliding (Batman), transporting one to the
[Darkforce dimension](Darkforce "wikilink") (The Shroud), or initiating
teleportation (Cloak). The supernatural character
[Spawn](Spawn_(comics) "wikilink") has a cape (actually a part of his
living symbiotic costume) that obeys Spawn's mental commands, changing
shape to scare, confuse or even kill would-be attackers, while [Meta
Knight](Meta_Knight "wikilink") from kirby fame disguises his wings as a
cape. Some media, such as *[Watchmen](Watchmen "wikilink")* or *[The
Incredibles](The_Incredibles "wikilink")*, comment on the potentially
lethal hazards of a cape.
