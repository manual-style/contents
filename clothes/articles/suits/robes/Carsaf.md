**Çarşaf** (), also written as *charshaf*,[1] is a simple, loose
over-garment, essentially a robe-like dress. It is a
[Turkish](Turkish_people "wikilink") version of Arabic
[Abaya](Abaya "wikilink") and also similar to the
[niqab](niqab "wikilink") and the [chador](chador "wikilink"). Literally
translated, *çarşaf* means "bed sheet".

The çarşaf is usually black. As with the [Iranian](Iran "wikilink")
chador, the çarşaf usually covers the lower part of the face, and the
cloth is held together by a pin placed below the nose. Sometimes, the
part of the cloth that covers the lower face is pinned laterally. In
contrast to the chador, the çarşaf usually consists of two parts; a top
that hangs to about the waist and a bottom that is cut like a wide,
floor-length skirt.

The çarşaf, rather than being a form of traditional Islamic clothing,
first became common towards the end of the 19th century, during the
reign of [Abdulhamid II](Abdulhamid_II "wikilink") (1876-1908), as a
form of rejection of Western influences. From then, it continued to be
used prevalently in remote parts of the former [Ottoman
Empire](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") such as [Yemen](Turkey "wikilink"),
where it is still widespread today.

According to research from 2012 (N/I, N/A 6%), less than 2% of women in
[Turkey](Turkey "wikilink") wore it and in 5% in
[Iraq](Iraq "wikilink").[2] According to another survey, only 0.1% of
Turkish women wore the çarşaf in 2012.[3]

However, it is used for prayer by women. Similar to the use of the
[mukena](mukena "wikilink") in [Muslim Southeast
Asia](Muslim_Southeast_Asia "wikilink").
