The **cassock** or **soutane** is an item of
[Christian](Christianity "wikilink") [clerical
clothing](clerical_clothing "wikilink") used by the
[clergy](clergy "wikilink") of [Catholic](Catholic_Church "wikilink"),
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox_Church "wikilink"),
[Anglican](Anglican_Communion "wikilink"),
[Lutheran](Lutheran "wikilink"), and
[Reformed](Reformed_Church "wikilink") churches, among others.
"Ankle-length garment" is the literal meaning of the corresponding
[Latin](Latin "wikilink") term, *vestis talaris*. It is related to the
[habit](Religious_habit "wikilink"), which is traditionally worn by
nuns, monks, and friars.

The cassock derives historically from the [tunic](tunic "wikilink") that
in [ancient](classical_antiquity "wikilink") Rome was worn underneath
the [toga](toga "wikilink") and the
[chiton](chiton_(costume) "wikilink") that was worn beneath the
[himation](himation "wikilink") in ancient Greece. In religious
services, it has traditionally been worn underneath
[vestments](vestment "wikilink"), such as the [alb](alb "wikilink").

In the West, the cassock is little used today except for religious
services, save for clergy in [traditionalist
Catholic](traditionalist_Catholic "wikilink") orders such as the
[Society of Saint Pius X](Society_of_Saint_Pius_X "wikilink"), the
[Priestly Fraternity of Saint
Peter](Priestly_Fraternity_of_Saint_Peter "wikilink"), the [Institute of
Christ the King Sovereign
Priest](Institute_of_Christ_the_King_Sovereign_Priest "wikilink"), the
[Canons Regular of Saint John
Cantius](St._John_Cantius_Church_(Chicago) "wikilink"), and the
[Congregation of Mary Immaculate
Queen](Congregation_of_Mary_Immaculate_Queen "wikilink") who continue to
wear the cassock as their standard clerical attire. However, in many
countries it was the normal everyday wear of the clergy until the second
half of the 20th century, when it was replaced even in those countries
by a conventional suit, distinguished from lay dress by being generally
black and by incorporating a [clerical
collar](clerical_collar "wikilink").

## Etymology

The word *cassock* comes from [Middle French](Middle_French "wikilink")
, meaning a long coat. In turn, the [Old French](Old_French "wikilink")
word may come ultimately from [Turkish](Turkish_language "wikilink")
(nomad, adventurer – the source of the word
*[Cossack](Cossack "wikilink")*), an allusion to their typical riding
coat, or from [Persian](Persian_language "wikilink") (padded garment) –
(raw silk) + (stuffed).[1] The name was originally specially applied to
the dress worn by soldiers and horsemen, and later to the long garment
worn in civil life by both men and women. As an ecclesiastical term the
word *cassock* came into use somewhat late (as a translation of the old
names of subtanea, vestis talaris, toga talaris, or tunica talaris),
being mentioned in canon 74 of 1604; and it is in this sense alone that
it now survives.

The word *[soutane](wikt:soutane#English "wikilink")* is a
[French](French_language "wikilink")-derived word, coming from
[Italian](Italian_language "wikilink") , derived in turn from
[Latin](Latin "wikilink") , the adjectival form of (beneath).[2]

![](Thomas_Eakins_-_Archbishop_Diomede_Falconio.jpg "fig:Thomas_Eakins_-_Archbishop_Diomede_Falconio.jpg")
The cassock (or soutane) comes in a number of styles or
[cuts](cut_(clothing) "wikilink"), though no particular symbolism
attaches to these. A [Roman](Rome "wikilink") cassock often has a series
of buttons down the front. In some English-speaking countries these
buttons may be merely ornamental, with a concealed fly-front buttoning,
known as a Chesterfield front, used to fasten the garment. A
[French](France "wikilink") cassock also has buttons sewn to the sleeves
after the manner of a [suit](Suit_(clothes) "wikilink"), and a slightly
broader skirt. An [Ambrosian](Ambrosian_Rite "wikilink") cassock has a
series of only five buttons under the neck, with a sash on the waist. A
[Jesuit](Society_of_Jesus "wikilink") cassock, in lieu of buttons, has a
fly fastened with hooks at the collar and is bound at the waist with a
cincture knotted on the right side.

The ordinary Roman cassock worn by Roman Catholic clerics (as distinct
from that worn as choir dress) is black except in
[tropical](Tropics "wikilink") countries, where because of the heat it
is white and usually without shoulder cape
([pellegrina](pellegrina "wikilink")). Coloured
[piping](Piping_(sewing) "wikilink") and buttons are added in accordance
with rank: black for priests, purple for [chaplains of His
Holiness](Chaplain_of_His_Holiness "wikilink"); [amaranth
red](Amaranth_(color) "wikilink") for
[bishops](Bishop_(Catholicism) "wikilink"), [protonotaries
apostolic](Protonotary_apostolic "wikilink") and [Honorary
Prelates](Honorary_Prelate "wikilink"); and [scarlet
red](scarlet_(color) "wikilink") for
[cardinals](Cardinal_(Catholicism) "wikilink").[3]

The 1969 Instruction on the dress of prelates stated that for all of
them, even cardinals, the dress for ordinary use may be a simple black
cassock without coloured trim.[4]

A band cincture or sash, known also as a
[fascia](Fascia_(vestment) "wikilink"), may be worn with the cassock.
The Instruction on the dress of prelates specifies that the two ends
that hang down by the side have silk fringes, abolishing the sash with
tassels.[5] A black faille fascia is worn by priests, deacons, and major
seminarians, while a purple faille fascia is used by bishops,
protonotaries apostolic, honorary prelates, and chaplains of His
Holiness, when wearing a cassock with coloured trim. A black
watered-silk fascia is permitted for priests attached to the [papal
household](papal_household "wikilink"), a purple watered-silk fascia for
bishops attached to the papal household (for example, [Apostolic
Nuncios](Apostolic_Nuncio "wikilink")), and a scarlet watered-silk
fascia for cardinals. The Pope wears a white watered-silk fascia,
sometimes with his coat of arms on the ends.

![](BentoXVI-58-12052007.jpg "fig:BentoXVI-58-12052007.jpg") in white
cassock (sometimes though unofficially called a
*[simar](simar "wikilink")*) with [pellegrina](pellegrina "wikilink")
and fringed white fascia.\]\] In [choir dress](choir_dress "wikilink"),
chaplains of His Holiness wear their purple-trimmed black cassocks with
a [cotta](Surplice "wikilink"), but bishops, protonotaries apostolic,
and honorary prelates use (with a cotta or, in the case of bishops, a
[rochet](rochet "wikilink") and [mozzetta](mozzetta "wikilink"))
cassocks that are fully purple (this purple corresponds more closely
with a Roman purple and is approximated as fuchsia) with scarlet trim,
while those of cardinals are fully scarlet with scarlet trim. Cardinals
have the additional distinction of having both choir cassock sleeves and
the fascia made of scarlet watered-silk. The *cut* of the choir cassock
is still a Roman-cut or French-cut Roman cassock.

In the past, a cardinal's cassock was made entirely of watered silk,
with a train that could be fastened at the back of the cassock. This
train was abolished by the *[motu proprio](motu_proprio "wikilink")*
*Valde solliciti* of [Pope Pius XII](Pope_Pius_XII "wikilink") with
effect from 1 January 1953.[6] With the same *motu proprio*, the Pope
ordered that the violet cassock (then used in penitential periods and in
mourning) be made of wool, not silk,[7] and in February 1965, under Pope
Paul VI, a circular of the Sacred Ceremonial Congregation abolished the
use of watered silk also for the red cassock.[8]

An elbow-length shoulder cape, open in front, is sometimes worn with the
cassock, either fixed to it or detachable. It is known as a
[pellegrina](pellegrina "wikilink"). It is distinct from the mozzetta,
which is buttoned in front and is worn over a
[rochet](rochet "wikilink").

The general rule of the Roman Catholic Church is that the pellegrina may
be worn with the cassock by cardinals and bishops.[9] In 1850, the year
in which he [restored the Catholic
hierarchy](Universalis_Ecclesiae "wikilink") in England and Wales, [Pope
Pius IX](Pope_Pius_IX "wikilink") was understood to grant to all priests
there the privilege of wearing a replica in black of his own white caped
cassock.[10] Since then, the wearing of the pellegrina with the cassock
has been a sign of a Roman Catholic priest in England and Wales,
Scotland, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, although sometimes
imitated by Anglican priests.

In his 1909 book, *Costume of Prelates of the Catholic Church*, John
Abel Felix Prosper Nainfa proposed[11] the use of the English word
"[simar](simar "wikilink")", instead of the word "cassock", for the
garment with shoulder cape, which he treated as distinct from the
cassock proper. Others too have made the same distinction between the
"simar" (with pellegrina) and the "cassock" (without), but many scholars
disagree with Nainfa's distinction.[12] More particularly, documents of
the [Holy See](Holy_See "wikilink") make no such distinction, using the
term *cassock* or *vestis talaris* whether a pellegrina is attached or
is not. Thus the 1969 instruction states that, for cardinals and
bishops, "the elbow-length cape, trimmed in the same manner as this
*cassock*, may be worn over it".[13] *Cassock*, rather than *simar*, is
the term that is usually applied to the dress of Popes and other
Catholic ecclesiastics. The instruction also gives no support to
Nainfa's claim that the cassock with shoulder cape should not be worn in
church services, which moreover would be of difficult application, since
the cassock with pellegrina is generally made as a single garment, with
a non-detachable pellegrina.

Nainfa wrote that at that time the garment with shoulder cape was in
Italian called a *zimarra*, a term, however, that in that language is
today used rather of a historical loose-fitting overgown, quite unlike
the close-fitting cassock with pellegrina worn by Catholic
clergy,[14][15] and similar to the fur-lined
[Schaube](:de:Schaube "wikilink") that was used in northern
Europe.[16][17] Images of the historical zimarra as worn by women can be
seen at "Dressing the Italian Way"[18] and "The Italian Showcase".[19]

In cold weather, the manto, an ankle-length cape with or without
shoulder cape, or the [greca](greca_(clothing) "wikilink"), also known
as the douillette, an ankle-length double-breasted overcoat, is
traditionally worn over the cassock. For bishops and priests both the
manto and greca are solid black in colour, while for the pope the manto
is red and the greca is white.

Cassocks are sometimes worn by seminarians studying for the priesthood,
by religious brothers, and by members of choirs (frequently with cotta
or, more usually in Anglican churches, [surplice](surplice "wikilink")).

### Anglican

![](Anne_Jeff_555.JPG "fig:Anne_Jeff_555.JPG") wearing the standard
double-breasted Sarum cassock\]\]

The [Anglican](Anglicanism "wikilink") church uses single and
double-breasted cassocks. For many this is to indicate tradition
(single-breasted in the [Anglo-Catholic](Anglo-Catholicism "wikilink")
tradition and double-breasted in the
[evangelical](evangelicalism "wikilink") end of the church).

The double-breasted cassock fastens at the shoulders on the opposing
side of the breast and at the waist with one concealed button. The
latter usually has a single small stem-button sewn at centre front about
12–15 cm / 4½–6" below the centre-front neck line which is used to
secure the academic hood, worn for Choir Dress.

The single-breasted cassock worn by Anglicans traditionally has
thirty-nine buttons as signifying the *[Thirty-Nine
Articles](Thirty-Nine_Articles "wikilink")* or as some would prefer
Forty Stripes Save One.

Cassocks are often worn without a cinture and some opt for a buckled
belt.[20]

Black is the most common colour for [priests](priest "wikilink"),
[readers](Lay_reader "wikilink"), vergers, and server cassocks. Lighter
colours, such as white are used in tropical countries and some
cathedrals have colours specific for their location. Piping is also used
in the Anglican church to indicate position held with red being used for
Deans, Archdeacons and Cathedral Canons. [Bishops](Bishop "wikilink")
and [Archbishops](Archbishop "wikilink") often wear purple cassocks.
This has been practise since the 19th century. More recently the
Archbishops have chosen to wear black, this can be seen in the
ministries of [Rowan Williams](Rowan_Williams "wikilink") and [Justin
Welby](Justin_Welby "wikilink"). Scarlet cassocks are properly worn only
by Chaplains to the Queen and by members of Royal foundations such as
Westminster Abbey and some Cambridge college chapels.

![](School_choir.jpg "fig:School_choir.jpg")s\]\] Cassocks are sometimes
also worn by [readers](Reader_(liturgy) "wikilink"), [altar
servers](altar_servers "wikilink"), and [choir](choir "wikilink")
members, when they do this is the double-breasted style. Readers and
altar servers usually wear black cassocks, but those worn by choirs are
usually coloured.

### Lutheran

In the Evangelical Lutheran Churches of
[Denmark](Church_of_Denmark "wikilink"), the [Faroe
Islands](Church_of_the_Faroe_Islands "wikilink"),
[Iceland](Church_of_Iceland "wikilink"), and the North German
[Hanseatic](Hanseatic_League "wikilink") cities of
[Hamburg](Hamburg "wikilink") and [Lübeck](Lübeck "wikilink"), clergy
wear the cassock with the [ruff](ruff_(clothing) "wikilink") as
[vestments](vestments "wikilink").

The Cassock is also worn in American Lutheran churches as often as the
clerical shirts and collar. It is customary to wear it on special high
holidays such as Good Friday and Ash Wednesday.

### Presbyterian

In the [Church of Scotland](Church_of_Scotland "wikilink"), and
Presbyterian churches which trace their heritage back to the Scottish
church, they typically use the Anglican style of cassock. In addition,
it is not uncommon to see full-length cassocks worn in the blue of the
[Flag of Scotland](Flag_of_Scotland "wikilink"), which is also tied to
the academic dress of the [University of St
Andrews](University_of_St_Andrews "wikilink"). As is the custom within
the Church of England, ministers of the Church of Scotland who are
chaplains to the royal family also wear a scarlet cassock. Over this is
typically worn a [preaching gown](geneva_gown "wikilink") or the
[academic gown](academic_gown "wikilink") of the minister. During the
[Edwardian](Edwardian_era "wikilink") and
[Victorian](Victorian_fashion "wikilink") era, it was common to see a
shortened, double-breasted black silk cassock worn under the gown. It
generally reached to the knees and was tied with a simple
[cincture](cincture "wikilink"). However, with the [liturgical
movement](liturgical_movement "wikilink") of the 20th century, the
classic cassock came back into fashion.

Presbyterians in Canada tend to follow the custom of the Church of
Scotland, whereas Presbyterians in the United States typically wear an
American Geneva gown over a sleeveless cassock or a non-cuffed gown over
an Anglican or Roman style cassock. The American [Geneva
gown](Geneva_gown "wikilink") is often supplied with a cuff sewn into
the double-bell sleeve (this innovation is a remnant of the cassock
sleeve that was formerly worn underneath).

As is the practice in the Anglican churches, cassocks may be worn by
others who are not ministers. Ordained elders and deacons, as they serve
as worship leaders, readers, and administer communion may also wear
cassocks which tend to be black. Those worn by choirs and other worship
leaders are usually coloured (for instance, The Shadyside Presbyterian
Church (U.S.A.) choir is dressed in red cassocks under white surplices).

## Eastern Christian practice

[Ignatius Zakka I Iwas](Ignatius_Zakka_I_Iwas "wikilink") (in red
cassock) and a priest (in black).\]\]

In Eastern Christianity there are two types of cassock: the Inner
Cassock and the Outer Cassock or Rason. Monastics always wear a black
cassock. There is no rule about colouration for non-monastic clergy, but
black is the most common. Blue or grey are also seen frequently, while
white is sometimes worn for [Pascha](Easter "wikilink"). In the Eastern
Churches, cassocks are not dress for any lay ministry. Generally, one
has to be blessed to wear a cassock usually in the case of exercising a
clerical duty.

### Types of Eastern cassocks

-   The **inner cassock** (more often simply *cassock*) is an ankle
    length garment worn by all major and minor clergy, monastics, and
    often by male [seminarians](seminary "wikilink"). The Slavic, or
    "Russian" style ( , ) is double-breasted, closely fitted through the
    torso and flaring out to the skirt, with a high collar buttoned
    off-center, and may be cinctured with either a leather or wide cloth
    belt.[21] The [Greek](Greece "wikilink") version, called an *anteri*
    (αντερί), *rason* (ράσον), or *zostiko* (ζωστικό) is somewhat
    fuller, gathered at the waist with a narrow cloth belt, and with a
    high collar buttoned in the front.[22] The inner cassock is usually
    worn by all clergy members under their liturgical vestments.
-   The **outer cassock** ( , , ) is a voluminous garment worn over the
    inner cassock by bishops, priests, deacons, and monastics as their
    regular outerwear.[23] It is not worn by seminarians,
    [readers](Reader_(liturgy) "wikilink") or
    [subdeacons](subdeacon "wikilink") in the Russian tradition. In the
    Greek tradition, however, chanters may wear it in church, usually
    with no inner cassock beneath but directly over secular clothing.
    The outer cassock should be worn by a priest celebrating a service
    such as [Vespers](Vespers "wikilink") where the rubrics call for him
    to be less than fully vested, but it is not worn by any clergy
    beneath the [sticharion](sticharion "wikilink"). It may be worn with
    the bottoms of the sleeves turned back, which are sometimes faced in
    a contrasting colour. The Greek version tends to be somewhat lighter
    weight and more fully cut than the Russian. It is originally a
    monastic garment, and in the Russian tradition a man must be
    explicitly blessed by the [bishop](bishop "wikilink") to wear it
    following his ordination to the [diaconate](deacon "wikilink").
-   A **cassock vest** ("kontorasson" (κοντόρασον), "amaniko" (αμάνικο),
    "gileko" (γιλέκο)) is sometimes worn over the inner cassock. This is
    a closely fitted collarless [vest](vest "wikilink"), usually falling
    slightly below the waist. The vest has its origins in the outer
    cassock and therefore should be worn only by clergy and monastics
    who would, in formal or liturgical settings, wear the outer
    cassock.[24][25]
-   A **cassock coat** may be worn on very cold days, with the same cut
    as the outer cassock but slightly larger and of heavier material. It
    may or may not have a fur-lined collar.[26] The coat is worn over
    the outer cassock, although many clerics may wear it in lieu of a
    coat on colder days.

## Non-clerical seventeenth-century garment

The *cassock* can also refer to a loose-fitting, pullover, hip-length
[jacket](jacket "wikilink") worn by ordinary
[soldiers](soldier "wikilink") in the 17th century. A cassock has
attached [sleeves](sleeve "wikilink") and is open down the sides,
similar to a [mandilion](mandilion "wikilink"). Such garments are
popularly recognized as the formal uniform of the [Musketeers of the
Guard](Musketeers_of_the_Guard "wikilink") in *[The Three
Musketeers](The_Three_Musketeers "wikilink")* – though this is suspect
historically.
