Afghanistan, wearing chadors\]\] A **chādor** (), also variously spelled
in English as **chadah**, **chad(d)ar**, **chader**, **chud(d)ah**,
**chadur**, and naturalized as , is an outer
[garment](garment "wikilink") or open [cloak](cloak "wikilink") worn by
some [women in Iran](women_in_Iran "wikilink"),
[Iraq](women_in_Iraq "wikilink"), and some other countries under the
[Persianate](Persianate "wikilink") cultural sphere, as well as
predominantly [Shia](Shia "wikilink") areas in public spaces or
outdoors. A chador is a full-body-length semicircle of fabric that is
open down the front. This cloth is tossed over the woman's or girl's
head and she holds it closed in the front. The chador has no hand
openings, or any [buttons](Button_(clothing) "wikilink"), clasps, etc.,
but rather, it is held closed by her hands or tucked under the wearer's
arms.

Before the 1978–1979 [Iranian
Revolution](Iranian_Revolution "wikilink"), black chadors were reserved
for funerals and periods of mourning. Colorful, patterned fabrics were
the norm for everyday wear. Currently, the majority of Iranian women who
wear the chador use the black version outside, and reserve
light-coloured chadors for indoor use.

## Historical background

### Ancient and early Islamic times

![](Mahd_od_Owlia.jpg "fig:Mahd_od_Owlia.jpg"), regent of [Imperial
Iran](Qajar_dynasty "wikilink") in 1848\]\] [Fadwa El
Guindi](Fadwa_El_Guindi "wikilink") locates the origin of the veil in
ancient [Mesopotamia](Mesopotamia "wikilink"), where "wives and
daughters of high-ranking men of the nobility had to veil".[1] The veil
marked class status, and this [dress code](dress_code "wikilink") was
regulated by [sumptuary laws](sumptuary_law "wikilink").

One of the first representation of a chador is found on Ergili
sculptures and the "Satrap sarcophagus" from Persian Anatolia.[2]
Bruhn/Tilke, in their 1941 *A Pictorial History of Costume*, do show a
drawing, said to be copied from an Achaemenid relief of the 5th century
BC, of a woman with her lower face hidden by a long cloth wrapped around
her head.[3] [Achaemenid](Achaemenid_Empire "wikilink") Iranian women in
art were mostly veiled.[4] The earliest written record of *chador* can
be found in [Pahlavi scripts](Pahlavi_scripts "wikilink") from the 6th
century, as a female head dress worn by
[Zoroastrian](Zoroastrianism "wikilink") women.[5]

It is likely that the custom of veiling continued through the
[Seleucid](Seleucid "wikilink"), [Parthian](Parthian_Empire "wikilink"),
and [Sassanid](Sassanid "wikilink") periods. Veiling was not limited to
noble women but was practised also by the Persian
[kings](Shah "wikilink").[6] Upper-class Greek and
[Byzantine](Byzantine "wikilink") women were also secluded from the
public gaze. European visitors of the 18th and 19th centuries have left
pictorial records of women wearing the *chador* and the long white veil.

### Pahlavi dynasty

representing a woman tearing off her chador, [Baku](Baku "wikilink"),
[Azerbaijan](Azerbaijan "wikilink")\]\] The 20th century
[Pahlavi](Pahlavi_dynasty "wikilink") ruler [Reza
Shah](Reza_Shah "wikilink") banned the *chador* and all hijab in 1936,
as incompatible with his modernizing ambitions.[7] According to
Mir-Hosseini as cited by El Guindi, "the police were arresting women who
wore the veil and forcibly removing it". This policy outraged the
[Shi'a](Shi'a "wikilink") clerics, and ordinary men and women, to whom
"appearing in public without their cover was tantamount to nakedness".
However, she continues, "this move was welcomed by Westernized and
upperclass men and women, who saw it in liberal terms as a first step in
granting women their rights".[8]

### Iranian Revolution

In April 1980, during the Iranian Cultural Revolution, it was decided
that women in government offices and educational institutions would
observe the veil.[9] In 1983, a dispute regarding the veiling broke out,
and public conflict was motivated by the definition of veiling and its
scale (so-called "bad hijab" issue), sometimes followed even by clashes
against those who were perceived to wear improper clothing.[10]
Government felt obligated to deal with this situation; so, on 26 July
1984, Tehran's public prosecutor issued a statement and announced that
stricter dress-code is supposed to be observed in public places such as
institutions, theaters, clubs, hotels, motels, and restaurants, while in
the other places, it should [follow the
pattern](Peer_pressure "wikilink") of the overwhelming majority of
people.[11] Stricter veiling implies both chador and more loosely
[khimar](khimar "wikilink")-type headscarf along with
[overcoat](overcoat "wikilink").

## Usage

wearing chadors\]\]

Before the 1978–1979 [Iranian
Revolution](Iranian_Revolution "wikilink"), black chadors were reserved
for [funerals](funeral "wikilink") and periods of mourning. Light,
printed fabrics were the norm for everyday wear. Currently, the majority
of women who wear the chador reserve the usage of light-colored chadors
for around the house or for prayers. Most women who still go outside in
urban areas in a light colored chador are elderly women of rural
backgrounds. During the reign of the [Shah of
Iran](Pahlavi_dynasty "wikilink"), such traditional clothing was largely
discarded by the wealthier urban upper-class women in favor of modernity
for western clothing, although women in small towns and villages
continued to wear the chador. Traditionally a light coloured or printed
chador was worn with a [headscarf](headscarf "wikilink") (*rousari*), a
[blouse](blouse "wikilink") (*pirahan*), and a long
[skirt](skirt "wikilink") (*daaman*); or else a blouse and skirt or
dress over pants (*[shalvar](shalvar "wikilink")*), and these styles
continue to be worn by many rural Iranian women, in particular by older
women.

On the other hand, in Iran, the chador does not require the wearing of a
veil. Inside the home, particularly for urban women, both the chador and
the veil have been discarded, and there, women and teenagers wore cooler
and lighter garments; while in modern times, rural women continue to
wear a light-weight printed chador inside the home over their clothing
during their daily activities. The chador is worn by some Iranian women
regardless of whether they are [Sunni](Sunni "wikilink") or
[Shia](Shia "wikilink"), but is considered traditional to Persian
Iranians, with Iranians of other backgrounds wearing the chador or other
traditional forms of attire. For example, Arab Iranian women in Western
and Southern Iran retain their Overhead Abaya which is similar to the
overhead Abaya worn in [Iraq](Iraq "wikilink"),
[Kuwait](Kuwait "wikilink"), and [Bahrain](Bahrain "wikilink").
