The **chlamys** ([Ancient Greek](Greek_language "wikilink"):
[χλαμύς](Wiktionary:χλαμύς "wikilink"), gen.: χλαμύδος) was a type of an
[ancient Greek](ancient_Greece "wikilink") [cloak](cloak "wikilink").[1]
By the time of the [Byzantine Empire](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink") it
was, although in a much larger form, part of the state costume of the
emperor and high officials. It survived as such until at least the 12th
century AD.

The **ephaptis** (Ancient Greek: ἐφαπτίς) was a similar garment,
typically worn by infantrymen.[2]

## Ancient Greece

The chlamys was made from a seamless rectangle of
[woolen](wool "wikilink") material about the size of a blanket, usually
bordered. It was normally pinned with a
[fibula](Fibula_(brooch) "wikilink") at the right shoulder. Originally
it was wrapped around the waist like a loincloth, but by the end of the
5th century BC it was worn over the elbows. It could be worn over
another item of clothing but was often the sole item of clothing for
young soldiers and messengers, at least in [Greek
art](ancient_Greek_art "wikilink"). As such, the chlamys is the
characteristic garment of [Hermes](Hermes "wikilink") (Roman
[Mercury](Mercury_(mythology) "wikilink")), the messenger god usually
depicted as a young man.

The chlamys was typical [Greek military
attire](Military_history_of_ancient_Greece "wikilink") from the 5th to
the 3rd century BC. As worn by soldiers, it could be wrapped around the
arm and used as a light shield in combat.

## Byzantine period

The chlamys continued into the [Byzantine
period](Byzantine_dress "wikilink"), when it was often much larger and
usually worn sideways, at least by emperors, and likely made of silk. It
was held on with a [fibula](Fibula_(brooch) "wikilink") brooch at the
wearer's right shoulder and nearly reached the ground at front and back.
With the even grander *[loros](loros "wikilink")* costume, the "chlamys
costume" was the ceremonial wear of Byzantine emperors, and the only
option for high officials on very formal occasions.[3] It is generally
less common in surviving imperial portraits than the *loros* shown on
coins, though the large numbers of Byzantine coins that survive provide
many examples, with the fibula often the main indication in bust-length
depictions.

At the two edges of the cloak were large panels in a contrasting colour
called *tablia* (sing. *tablion*), beginning about level with the armpit
and reaching down to about the waist; typically only the one on the
wearer's left is seen in portraits. The emperor alone could wear a
purple chlamys with gold tablia; officials sometimes wore white with
purple *tablia*, as the two beside [Justinian I](Justinian_I "wikilink")
at [Ravenna](Ravenna "wikilink") do.[4] In the miniature shown below the
11th-century emperor wears his open to the side, presumably to allow
access to his sword, but the three officials have the opening at the
centre of their bodies.

By the Middle Byzantine period all parts of the chlamys were highly
decorative, with bright patterned [Byzantine
silk](Byzantine_silk "wikilink") and tablia and borders heavily
embroidered and encrusted with gems.[5] In the 12th century it seems to
have begun to fall from favour, although it continued to be shown on
coins until the 14th century, which was perhaps long after it was
actually worn. Some high officials seem to have continued to wear a
version of it long after the emperors had abandoned it.[6] While the
*loros* tended to represent the emperor in his religious role, the
chlamys represented his secular functions as head of state, head of the
administrative corps of the empire, and giver of justice.[7]

Among women only the empress is recorded as wearing a chlamys; she was
presented with it during the coronation ceremony. In art it is much
rarer to see an empress in it than in a *loros*, but in the well-known
ivory [Romanos ivory](Romanos_Ivory "wikilink") ([BnF](BnF "wikilink"),
Paris) [Eudokia Makrembolitissa](Eudokia_Makrembolitissa "wikilink")
wears one while her husband [Constantine X
Doukas](Constantine_X_Doukas "wikilink") (r. 1059–1067) wears the
*loros*.[8]
