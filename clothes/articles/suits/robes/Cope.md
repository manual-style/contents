The **cope** (known in Latin as *pluviale* 'rain coat' or *cappa*
'cape') is a liturgical [vestment](vestment "wikilink"), more precisely
a long mantle or cloak, open in front and fastened at the breast with a
band or clasp. It may be of any [liturgical
colour](liturgical_colours "wikilink").

A cope may be worn by any rank of the clergy, and also by lay ministers
in certain circumstances. If worn by a [bishop](bishop "wikilink"), it
is generally accompanied by a [mitre](mitre "wikilink"). The
[clasp](buckle "wikilink"), which is often highly ornamented, is called
a *morse*. In art, angels are often shown wearing copes, especially in
[Early Netherlandish painting](Early_Netherlandish_painting "wikilink").

## History

![](Jan_van_eyck,_annunciazione,_dettaglio,_1434-36_circa.JPG "fig:Jan_van_eyck,_annunciazione,_dettaglio,_1434-36_circa.JPG")
wears a rich cope with a huge jewelled morse in [Jan van Eyck's
*Annunciation*](Annunciation_(van_Eyck,_Washington) "wikilink"),
1434-36\]\]

There has been little change in the character of the vestment from the
earliest ages. Then as now it was made of a piece of
[silk](silk "wikilink") or other cloth of semicircular shape, which
distinguished it from the earlier form of
[chasuble](chasuble "wikilink"), as a chasuble had straight edges sewn
together in front. Both are similar in form and origin to the Orthodox
[phelonion](phelonion "wikilink").

The only noticeable modification which the cope has undergone lies in
the disappearance of the hood. Some early examples feature a triangular
hood, which was intended to be of practical utility in covering the head
in processions, etc., but over time the hood became merely ornamental,
and is commonly represented by a sort of shield of embroidery, sometimes
adorned with a fringe or tassel. The fact that in many early chasubles,
as depicted in the drawings of the eighth and ninth centuries, we see
clear traces of a primitive hood, strongly confirms the view that in
their origin cope and chasuble were identical, the chasuble being only a
cope with its edges sewn together.

The earliest mention of a *cappa* is by [St. Gregory of
Tours](St._Gregory_of_Tours "wikilink"), and in the *Miracula* of St.
Furseus where it seems to mean a cloak with a hood. So from a letter
written in 787 by [Theodemar](Theodemar "wikilink"),
[Benedictine](Benedictine "wikilink") [Abbot](Abbot "wikilink") of
[Monte Cassino](Monte_Cassino "wikilink"), in answer to a question of
[Charlemagne](Charlemagne "wikilink") about the dress of the
[monk](monk "wikilink")[1] we learn that what in Gaul was styled
*cuculla* ([cowl](cowl "wikilink")) was known to the Cassinese monks as
*cappa*. Moreover, the word occurs more than once in
[Alcuin](Alcuin "wikilink")'s correspondence, apparently as denoting a
garment for everyday wear. When Alcuin twice observes about a *casula*
which was sent him, that he meant to wear it always at
[Mass](Mass_(liturgy) "wikilink"), we may probably infer that such
garments at this date were not distinctively liturgical owing to
anything in their material or construction, but that they were set aside
for the use of the altar at the choice of the owner, who might equally
well have used them as part of his ordinary attire. In the case of the
chasuble the process of liturgical specialization was completed at a
comparatively early date, and before the end of the ninth century the
maker of a *casula* probably knew quite well in most cases whether he
intended his handiwork for a Mass vestment or for an everyday outer
garment. But in the case of a *cappa* or cope, this period of
specialization seems to have been delayed until much later. The two
hundred *cappae* or copes which appear in a
[Saint-Riquier](Saint-Riquier "wikilink") inventory in the year 801, a
number increased to 377 by the year 831, were thought to be mere cloaks,
for the most part of rude material and destined for common wear. It may
be that their use [in choir](Choir_dress "wikilink") was believed to add
to the decorum and solemnity of the [Divine
Office](Liturgy_of_the_Hours "wikilink"), especially in the winter
season. In 831 one of the Saint-Riquier copes is specially mentioned as
being of chestnut colour and embroidered with gold. This, no doubt,
implies use by a dignitary, but it does not prove that it was as yet
regarded as a sacred vestment. In fact, according to the conclusions of
[Edmund Bishop](Edmund_Bishop "wikilink"), who was the first to sift the
evidence thoroughly, it was not until the twelfth century that the cope,
made of rich material, was in general use in the ceremonies of the
Church, at which time it had come to be regarded as the special vestment
of cantors.[2] Still, an ornamental cope was even then considered a
vestment that might be used by any member of the clergy from the highest
to the lowest, in fact even by one who was only about to be
[tonsured](tonsure "wikilink").

Amongst monks it was the practice to vest the whole community, except
the celebrant and the sacred ministers who assisted the celebrant, in
copes at [High Mass](Solemn_Mass "wikilink") on the greatest festivals,
whereas on feasts of somewhat lower grade, the community were usually
vested in [albs](alb "wikilink"). In this movement the Netherlands,
France, and Germany had taken the lead, as we learn from extant
inventories. For example, already in 870, in the
[Abbey](Abbey "wikilink") of [Saint Trond](Saint_Trond "wikilink") we
find "thirty-three precious copes of silk" as against only twelve
chasubles, and it was clearly the [Cluny](Cluny_Abbey "wikilink")
practice in the latter part of the tenth century to vest all the monks
in copes during high Mass on the great feasts, though in England the
regulations of Saint [Dunstan](Dunstan "wikilink") and [Saint
Aethelwold](Ã†thelwold_of_Winchester "wikilink") show no signs of any
such observance. The custom spread to the secular
[canons](Canon_(priest) "wikilink") of such
[cathedrals](cathedral "wikilink") as [Rouen](Rouen "wikilink"), and
[cantors](Cantor_(church) "wikilink") nearly everywhere used copes of
silk as their own peculiar adornment in the exercise of their functions.

Meanwhile, the old ***cappa nigra***(black cape), or***cappa
choralis***, a choir cape of black material, open or partly open in
front, and commonly provided with a functioning hood, still continued in
use. While the cope was a liturgical vestment, made of rich, colorful
fabric and often highly decorated, the *cappa nigra* was a practical
garment, made of heavy plain black wool and designed to provide warmth
in cold weather. Whereas the cope's hood had long since become a
non-functional decorative item, the hood of the *cappa nigra* remained
functional. The *cappa nigra* (black cape) was worn at the [Divine
Office](Liturgy_of_the_Hours "wikilink") by the clergy of cathedral and
[collegiate churches](collegiate_church "wikilink") and also by many
religious, as, for example, it is retained by the
[Dominicans](Dominican_Order "wikilink") during the winter months down
to the present day. No doubt the "copes" of the
[friars](friar "wikilink"), to which so many references in the
[Wycliffite](John_Wycliffe "wikilink") literature and in the writings of
[Chaucer](Chaucer "wikilink") and
[Langland](William_Langland "wikilink") are found, designate their open
mantles, which were, we may say, part of their full dress, though not
always black in colour. On the other hand, it is worth a note that the
*cappa clausa*, or close cope, was simply a cope or cape sewn up in
front for common outdoor use. "The wearing of this", says Bishop,[3]
"instead of the *cappa scissa*, the same cope not sewn up, is again and
again enjoined on the clergy by [synods](synod "wikilink") and
[statutes](statute "wikilink") during the late [Middle
Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink")."

## Catholic Church

![](Beno%C3%AEt_xvi_manteau.jpg "fig:Beno%C3%AEt_xvi_manteau.jpg") by
[Pope Benedict XVI](Pope_Benedict_XVI "wikilink")\]\] Under all these
different forms the cope has not substantially changed its character or
shape. The cope is a vestment for processions worn by all ranks of the
clergy when assisting at a liturgical function, but it is never worn by
the [priest](Priesthood_(Catholic_Church) "wikilink") and his sacred
ministers in celebrating the [Mass](Mass_(liturgy) "wikilink"). At a
[Pontifical High Mass](Pontifical_High_Mass "wikilink") the cope was
worn by the "[assistant priest](assistant_priest "wikilink")," a priest
who assists the [bishop](bishop "wikilink") who is the actual celebrant.
In the [Sarum Rite](Sarum_Rite "wikilink"), the Cope was also prescribed
for members of the choir at various times.

It is now the vestment assigned to the celebrant, whether priest or
bishop, for almost all functions except the
[Mass](Mass_(liturgy) "wikilink") when the celebrant wears the
[chasuble](chasuble "wikilink") instead. The cope is used, for example,
in [processions](procession "wikilink"), in the greater
[blessings](Blessing_(Roman_Catholic_Church) "wikilink") and
[consecrations](consecration "wikilink"), at the solemnly celebrated
[Liturgy of the Hours](Liturgy_of_the_Hours "wikilink"), in giving
[Benediction of the Blessed
Sacrament](Benediction_of_the_Blessed_Sacrament "wikilink"), and the
celebration of other [sacraments](sacrament "wikilink") outside of
[Mass](Mass_(liturgy) "wikilink"). For most of these the celebrant may
instead wear simply [cassock](cassock "wikilink") and
[surplice](surplice "wikilink") or alb, both with the
[stole](Stole_(vestment) "wikilink"), for simpler celebrations. The
[chasuble](chasuble "wikilink"), which is properly only worn for Mass,
may also be worn during processions and other ceremonies that occur
directly before or after Mass, such as the
[absolutions](absolution "wikilink") and [burial of the
dead](funeral "wikilink"), at the [Asperges](Asperges "wikilink") before
Mass, and at the blessing and imposition of the ashes on [Ash
Wednesday](Ash_Wednesday "wikilink"), to avoid the need for the
celebrant to change vestments.

The [CÃ¦remoniale Episcoporum](CÃ¦remoniale_Episcoporum "wikilink")
envisages its use by a bishop if presiding at but not celebrating
[Mass](Mass_(liturgy) "wikilink"), for the [Liturgy of the
Hours](Liturgy_of_the_Hours "wikilink"), for processions, at the special
ceremonies on the Feast of the [Presentation of the
Lord](Presentation_of_the_Lord "wikilink"), [Lenten](Lent "wikilink")
gatherings modelled on the "stations" in Rome, [Palm
Sunday](Palm_Sunday "wikilink") and [Corpus
Christi](Corpus_Christi_(feast) "wikilink"). The bishop may use a cope
when celebrating outside of Mass the sacraments of
[baptism](baptism "wikilink"), [confirmation](confirmation "wikilink"),
[matrimony](matrimony "wikilink"), [penance](penance "wikilink") in
solemn form, [ordination](ordination "wikilink") (if not
concelebrating), and [anointing of the
sick](anointing_of_the_sick "wikilink"). The list in the index of the
CÃ¦remoniale Episcoporum continues with several more cases.

As regards [liturgical colours](liturgical_colours "wikilink"), the cope
usually follows the color assigned to that day in the [liturgical
calendar](liturgical_calendar "wikilink"), although white may always be
worn for celebrations of a joyful character or before the Blessed
Sacrament, and violet may always be worn for celebrations of a
[penitential](penitence "wikilink") character. It may be made of any
rich or becoming material, including [cloth of
gold](cloth_of_gold "wikilink") (which may be used in place of any
colour except violet or black). Owing to its ample dimensions and
unvarying shape, ancient copes are preserved to us in proportionately
greater numbers than other vestments and provide the finest specimens of
medieval embroidery we possess. Among these the "Syon Cope" in the
[Victoria and Albert Museum](Victoria_and_Albert_Museum "wikilink"),
London, and the "Ascoli Cope" in the Pinacoteca Civica, [Ascoli
Piceno](Ascoli_Piceno "wikilink"), are remarkable as representing the
highest excellence of that specially English thirteenth-century
embroidery known as the *opus anglicanum* ('English work'). We are also
indebted to the use of copes for some magnificent specimens of the
jeweller's craft. The brooch or clasp, meant to fasten the cope in
front, and variously called morse, pectoral, bottone, etc., was an
object often in the highest degree precious and costly. The work which
was the foundation of all the fortunes of [Benvenuto
Cellini](Benvenuto_Cellini "wikilink") was the magnificent morse which
he made for Pope [Clement VII](Clement_VII "wikilink"). Some admirable
examples of these morses still
survive.![](Pope_Paul_VI_wearing_the_mantum.jpg "fig:Pope_Paul_VI_wearing_the_mantum.jpg")
wearing the mantum.\]\]

### Papal mantum

The **mantum** or **papal mantle** differs little from an ordinary cope
except that it is somewhat longer, and is fastened in the front by an
elaborate morse. In earlier centuries it was red in colour; red, at the
time being the papal colour rather than white. In the eleventh and
twelfth centuries the *immantatio*, or bestowal of the mantum on the
newly elected pope, was regarded as specially symbolical of
[investiture](investiture "wikilink") with papal authority: *Investio te
de papatu romano ut praesis urbi et orbi*, "I invest you with the Roman
papacy, that you may rule over the city and the world" were the words
used in conferring it at the [papal
coronation](papal_coronation "wikilink"). After the [Second Vatican
Council](Second_Vatican_Council "wikilink") and the pontificate of [Pope
Paul VI](Pope_Paul_VI "wikilink"), the longer mantum fell out of use.
His successors have instead used a cope in its place. Some old mantums
were converted to copes by being shortened, such as during the
pontificate of [Pope Benedict XVI](Pope_Benedict_XVI "wikilink").

### Cappa magna

The **cappa magna** (literally, "great cape"), a form of mantle, is a
voluminous ecclesiastical vestment with a long
[train](Train_(clothing) "wikilink"), proper to
[cardinals](Cardinal_(Catholicism) "wikilink"),
[bishops](bishop "wikilink"), and certain other honorary
[prelates](prelate "wikilink"). It is however a jurisdictional garment.

The cappa magna is not strictly a liturgical vestment, but only a
glorified *cappa choralis*, or choir cope. That is to say, it is not
used when vested as a celebrant at a liturgical service. It is worn in
processions or "[in choir](Choir_dress "wikilink")" (i.e., attending but
not celebrating services). Its colour for cardinals is ordinarily red
and for bishops violet. Cardinals and [papal
nuncios](papal_nuncio "wikilink") are entitled to wear a cappa magna of
[watered silk](watered_silk "wikilink").
![](Cardeal_franc_rodÃ©.jpg "fig:Cardeal_franc_rodÃ©.jpg") wearing a
winter [cappa magna](cappa_magna "wikilink") with
[ermine](ermine "wikilink").\]\] The cappa magna is ample in volume and
provided with a long train and a disproportionately large hood, the
lining of the hood is [ermine](ermine "wikilink") in winter and
[silk](silk "wikilink") in summer, and was made in such a way as to
completely cover not only the back, but also the breast and shoulders.
The hood is functional and in earlier times was often placed on the head
and covered with the [galero](galero "wikilink"). This used to be the
custom when the pope created a new cardinal at a
[consistory](papal_consistory "wikilink"). Nowadays, the hood is
normally worn over the head only during penitential rites. Previously,
cardinals who were members of specific [religious
orders](religious_order "wikilink") would wear a cappa magna in the
color of their order. Nowadays, the few remaining cardinals who still
use this garment wear red.

The motu proprio *Valde solliciti*[4] of 30 November 1952 ordered that
the train of the cappa magna should be shortened by about half (from 15
metres to 7).[5] The 1969 *Instruction on the Dress, Titles and
Coats-of-arms of Cardinals, Bishops and Lesser Prelates*[6] laid down
that:

> The cappa magna, always without ermine, is no longer obligatory; it
> can be used only outside of Rome, in circumstances of very special
> solemnity. (Â§ 12)

Since then, the cappa magna is hardly ever used except in celebrations
according to the pre-1969 liturgical books, as it was used for the
ordination of deacons of the [Institute of Christ the King Sovereign
Priest](Institute_of_Christ_the_King_Sovereign_Priest "wikilink") in
2009.[7]

The [Latin Patriarch of
Jerusalem](Latin_Patriarch_of_Jerusalem "wikilink") still uses the
ermine-lined winter cappa, because he is bound by the complex and
unalterable rules of the *[Status
quo](Status_quo_(Holy_Land_sites) "wikilink")*, an 1852
[Ottoman](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") [firman](firman "wikilink") which
regulates the delicate relations between the various religious groups
that care for the religious sites in the [Holy
Land](Holy_Land "wikilink"). This anomaly is most evident at the
[Midnight Mass](Christmas_Eve "wikilink") on [Christmas
Eve](Christmas_Eve "wikilink") in [Bethlehem](Bethlehem "wikilink").

## Use in the Church of England and Anglican Communion

The earliest post-[Reformation](English_Reformation "wikilink") [prayer
books](Book_of_Common_Prayer "wikilink") of the [Church of
England](Church_of_England "wikilink") contemplated the continued use of
the cope, with the 1549 Prayer Book specifying that the priest at Holy
Communion should wear "a vestment or cope". It was common, particularly
in English cathedrals, for the priest or bishop to wear a cope for Holy
Communion from the Restoration. In the contemporary Church of England
and the [Anglican Communion](Anglican_Communion "wikilink") as a whole,
the cope can be worn as a Eucharistic vestment, and sometimes as a
non-Eucharistic vestment, in the same manner as that of the [Roman
Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "wikilink"). It is also an
Anglican tradition for clergy to wear copes on diocesan occasions.

In the Church of England itself, the cope is worn by the [Archbishop of
Canterbury](Archbishop_of_Canterbury "wikilink") during the [coronation
of the Sovereign](Coronation_of_the_British_monarch "wikilink"). Prior
to [her coronation](Coronation_of_Elizabeth_II "wikilink") in 1953,
[Queen Elizabeth II](Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink")
presented a set of ornate copes to the Canons of [Westminster
Abbey](Westminster_Abbey "wikilink") as a gift.

## Use in Lutheran churches

![](Henning_Toft_Bro1_(bispevielse).jpg "fig:Henning_Toft_Bro1_(bispevielse).jpg")
[bishops](bishops "wikilink") wearing a cope over
[cassock](cassock "wikilink"), [surplice](surplice "wikilink"),
[ruff](ruff_(clothing) "wikilink") and [pectoral
cross](pectoral_cross "wikilink").\]\]

The cope is usually worn only for processions and services of the Divine
Office (morning and evening prayers) in most Lutheran denominations. In
the [Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America](Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_America "wikilink"), which is
similar to the churches of the Anglican Communion, the cope is usually
worn by the bishop when not serving as the presiding minister at Holy
Communion. In the [Church of Norway](Church_of_Norway "wikilink") and
the [Church of Denmark](Church_of_Denmark "wikilink") the cope is
reserved for use by bishops. It is infrequently worn by clerics in the
[Lutheran Churchâ€“Missouri
Synod](Lutheran_Churchâ€“Missouri_Synod "wikilink") or other Lutheran
denominations, although its use has increased in recent decades.

![](Biskopsvigning_Uppsala_Domkyrka_2011-03-06_002.jpg "fig:Biskopsvigning_Uppsala_Domkyrka_2011-03-06_002.jpg")
bishops with [crosiers](crosier "wikilink") wearing copes and
[mitres](mitre "wikilink") over [albs](alb "wikilink"),
[amices](amice "wikilink"), [stoles](Stole_(vestment) "wikilink") and
[pectoral crossses](pectoral_cross "wikilink").\]\] In the [Church of
Sweden](Church_of_Sweden "wikilink") the cope is regularly worn by
bishops together with the mitre, crosier and pectoral cross, but can
also be worn by priests on solemn and ceremonial occasions such as when
presiding over baptisms, weddings and funerals. Much like in the [Roman
Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "wikilink") the cope is not worn
as a eucharistic vestment by either bishops or priests, when the
chasuble is instead prescribed for both.[8]

## Use in universities

![](Cappa_clausa.jpg "fig:Cappa_clausa.jpg").\]\] As part of [academic
dress](academic_dress "wikilink"), the [University of
Cambridge](University_of_Cambridge "wikilink") uses a cope known as a
*cappa clausa* which is made of scarlet superfine cloth with the cowl
lined and the cape opening edged with white fur and is closed with
clasps. This was once the Congregation dress of DDs but has now come to
be the Vice-Chancellor's (or his or her deputies') official congregation
dress when conferring degrees. Praelectors presenting candidates for
higher doctoral degrees also wear the cope.

The only other place that still uses the cope is the [University of the
South](University_of_the_South "wikilink") in America where it is also
the official dress of the vice-chancellor. The only difference from the
Cambridge cope is that the cape hem is also edged in fur.

The academic cope is similar to the parliamentary robes of
[prelates](prelates "wikilink") in the [House of
Lords](House_of_Lords "wikilink"), worn during the British [State
Opening of Parliament](State_Opening_of_Parliament "wikilink").
