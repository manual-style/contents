![](Dalmatiek.jpg "fig:Dalmatiek.jpg"))\]\] The **dalmatic** is a long,
wide-sleeved [tunic](tunic "wikilink"), which serves as a liturgical
[vestment](vestment "wikilink") in the
[Catholic](Catholic_Church "wikilink"), [Lutheran](Lutheran "wikilink"),
[Anglican](Anglican "wikilink"), [United
Methodist](United_Methodist "wikilink"), and some other churches. When
used, it is the proper vestment of a [deacon](deacon "wikilink") at
[Mass](Mass_(liturgy) "wikilink") or other services. Although
infrequent, it may also be worn by [bishops](bishop "wikilink") above
the [alb](alb "wikilink") and below the [chasuble](chasuble "wikilink"),
and is then referred to as **pontifical dalmatic**.

Like the chasuble worn by priests and bishops, it is an outer vestment
and is supposed to match the [liturgical
colour](liturgical_colors "wikilink") of the day. The dalmatic is often
made of the same material and decoration as a chasuble, so as to form a
matching pair. Traditional [Solemn Mass](Solemn_Mass "wikilink")
vestment sets include matching chasuble, dalmatic, and
[tunicle](tunicle "wikilink").

A dalmatic is also worn by the [British](United_Kingdom "wikilink")
[monarch](Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") during the
[Coronation service](Coronation_of_the_British_monarch "wikilink").

## History

In the [Roman Empire](Roman_Empire "wikilink"), the dalmatic was an
amply sleeved [tunic](tunic "wikilink") (from Dalmatia) with wide
stripes *(clavi)* that were sometimes worked with elaborate designs.
Dalmatics had become typical attire for upper-class women in the latter
part of the 3rd century AD. They are pictured in a few funerary
portraits on shrouds from [Antinoopolis](Antinoopolis "wikilink") in
[Roman Egypt](Roman_Egypt "wikilink").[1] Literary sources record
dalmatics as imperial gifts to individuals.[2]

It was a normal item of clothing at the time when ecclesiastical clothes
began to develop separately around the fourth century, worn over a
longer tunic by the upper classes, and as the longest part of the dress
of men of lower rank.

The dalmatic was a garment of [Byzantine
dress](Byzantine_dress "wikilink"), and was adopted by Emperor [Paul
I](Paul_I_of_Russia "wikilink") of the [Russian
Empire](Russian_Empire "wikilink") as a coronation and liturgical
vestment. In [Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox_Church "wikilink")
[icons](icon "wikilink") of [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "wikilink") as
[King](monarch "wikilink") and Great [High
Priest](wiktionary:High_Priest "wikilink") he is shown in a dalmatic.[3]

## Roman Catholic Church

The dalmatic is a robe with wide sleeves; it reaches to at least the
knees or lower. In 18th-century vestment fashion, it is customary to
slit the under side of the sleeves so that the dalmatic becomes a mantle
like a [scapular](scapular "wikilink") with an opening for the head and
two square pieces of the material falling from the shoulder over the
upper arm. Modern dalmatics tend to be longer and have closed sleeves,
with the sides being open below the sleeve. The distinctive
ornamentation of the vestment consists of two vertical stripes running
from the shoulder to the hem; according to Roman usage these stripes are
narrow and sometimes united at the bottom by two narrow cross-stripes.
Outside of Rome the vertical stripes are quite broad and the cross-piece
is on the upper part of the garment. At a [Pontifical High
Mass](Pontifical_High_Mass "wikilink"), a dalmatic (usually made of
lighter material) is worn by the bishop under the chasuble. At solemn
papal liturgical occasions the Pope is assisted by two
[cardinal-deacons](Cardinal_(Catholicism)#Cardinal_deacon "wikilink")
vested in a dalmatic and wearing a *mitra simplex* (simple white
[mitre](mitre "wikilink")).

In the Roman Catholic Church the [subdeacons](subdeacon "wikilink") wore
a vestment called the [tunicle](tunicle "wikilink"), which was
originally distinct from a dalmatic, but by the 17th century the two had
become identical, though a tunicle was often less ornamented than a
dalmatic, the main difference often being only one horizontal stripe
versus the two becoming a deacon's vestment. Additionally, unlike
deacons, subdeacons do not wear a [stole](Stole_(vestment) "wikilink")
under their tunicle. Today, the tunicle is rare in the Roman Catholic
Church as only certain authorized clerical societies (such as the
[Priestly Fraternity of St.
Peter](Priestly_Fraternity_of_St._Peter "wikilink")) have subdeacons.

Traditionally the dalmatic was not used in the Roman rite by deacons
during Lent. In its place, depending on the point in the liturgy, was
worn either a folded [chasuble](chasuble "wikilink") or what was called
a broad [stole](Stole_(vestment) "wikilink"), which represented a
rolled-up chasuble. This tradition went back to a time at which the
dalmatic was still considered an essential secular garment and thus not
appropriate to be worn during the penitential season of Lent.

## Eastern tradition

![](Placing_Gospel_Book_onto_Antimension_at_end_of_Liturgy.jpeg "fig:Placing_Gospel_Book_onto_Antimension_at_end_of_Liturgy.jpeg")*\]\]
In the [Byzantine Rite](Byzantine_Rite "wikilink")
the*[sakkos](sakkos "wikilink")*, which is elaborately decorated and
amply cut, usually worn by the bishops as an outer vestment in place of
a presbyter's*[phelonion](phelonion "wikilink")*and which, like
the*phelonion'', corresponds to the western
[chasuble](chasuble "wikilink") and [cope](cope "wikilink"), is derived
from Byzantine imperial dress, and hence is identical in origin to the
Western dalmatic.

In all [Eastern rites](Eastern_Christianity "wikilink") the
*[sticharion](sticharion "wikilink")* (which is analogous to the Western
[alb](alb "wikilink")), of the ornate sort worn by deacons and lower
clergy, is sometimes referred to as a dalmatic.
