The **djellaba** or **jillaba** (; ;
[Berber](Berber_language "wikilink"): *Aselham*) is a long,
loose-fitting [unisex](unisex "wikilink") outer [robe](robe "wikilink")
with full sleeves that is worn in the [Maghreb](Maghreb "wikilink")
region of [North Africa](North_Africa "wikilink"); its origin is
[Morocco](Morocco "wikilink"). The word literally means *attractive*,
from *jalaba*, *to bring*, *fetch*; its Semitic root is *glb*.

## Overview

Traditionally, djellabas are made of wool in different shapes and
colours, but lightweight cotton djellabas have now become popular. Among
the Berbers, or Imazighen, such as the [Imilchil](Imilchil "wikilink")
in the [Atlas Mountains](Atlas_Mountains "wikilink"), the colour of a
djellaba traditionally indicates the marital status (single or married)
of the bearer:[1] a dark brown djellaba indicating bachelorhood.[2]

Traditionally, djellabas reached down to the ground but lightweight
djellabas are somewhat slimmer and shorter. Men often wear a
light-coloured djellaba sometimes along with a traditional Arab red [fez
hat](fez_hat "wikilink") and soft yellow babouche slippers
(*[balgha](balgha "wikilink")* in Arabic) for religious celebrations and
weddings.

Almost all djellabas of both styles (male or female) include a baggy
hood called a *qob* (Arabic: قب) that comes to a point at the back. The
hood is important for both sexes, as it protects the wearer from the
sun, and in earlier times, it was used as a defence against sand being
blown into the wearer's face by strong desert winds. In colder climes,
as in the mountains of Morocco and Algeria, it also serves the same
function as a winter hat, preventing heat loss through the head and
protecting the face from [snow](snow "wikilink") and
[rain](rain "wikilink"). It is common for the roomy hood to be used as a
pocket during times of warm weather; it can fit loaves of bread or bags
of groceries.

Traditional djellabas are generally made of two types of material,
cotton for summer wear and coarse wool for the winter. The wool is
typically obtained from sheep in the surrounding mountains.
