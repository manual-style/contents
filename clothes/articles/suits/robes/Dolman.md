A **Dolman** (from [Turkish](Turkish_language "wikilink") *dolaman*
"robe" [1]) is a somewhat vague term for various types of
[clothing](clothing "wikilink"), all of which have sleeves and cover the
top part of the body, and sometimes more. Originally, the term referred
to a long and loose [garment](garment "wikilink") with narrow
[sleeves](sleeve "wikilink") and an opening in the front. It was worn
generally by the [Turks](Turkish_people "wikilink"), and is like a
[cassock](cassock "wikilink") in shape.[2]

## Military dolman

The name "dolman" was also given to the short uniform jacket worn by
[hussars](hussar "wikilink"). The close-fitting, short-cut coat was
heavily braided. It was usually worn under a
[pelisse](pelisse "wikilink"), a similar coat but with fur trimming,
most often worn slung over the left shoulder with the sleeves hanging
loose.

## Fashionable dolman

![](A_wool_and_silk_dolman.jpg "fig:A_wool_and_silk_dolman.jpg") A
dolman is also an outer garment worn by ladies, with wide cape like
arrangements instead of sleeves. It was a favourite style of
[mantle](mantle_(clothing) "wikilink") worn by fashionable women in the
1870s and 80's.

A **dolman sleeve** is a sleeve set into a very low
[armscye](armscye "wikilink"); in fact, the armscye may extend to the
waistline, in which case there will be no underarm seam in the blouse.
Dolman sleeves were very popular in ladies clothing during the US Civil
War. They had the effect of making the shoulders look sloped therefore
minimizing the appearance of the waist. The early 21st century dolman
sleeve describes a sleeve cut as one with the bodice, which can taper to
the wrist or be cut widely.[3]
