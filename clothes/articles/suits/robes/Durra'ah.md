The ***durrāʿah*** was a ceremonial robe worn by the
[Abbasid](Abbasid "wikilink") court from the time of caliph
[al-Mansur](al-Mansur "wikilink") (r. 754–775) until it was replaced by
the shorter *qabāʾ* in the mid-9th century. It was black, the official
colour of the Abbasid dynasty, and was closed in the front by buttons.
Its use as court dress for civilian and military officials—but not
religious, who wore the *ṭaylasān* instead—gave it great prestige.
