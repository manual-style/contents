![](Furisode.JPG "fig:Furisode.JPG") A is a style of
*[kimono](kimono "wikilink")* distinguishable by its long sleeves, which
range in length from 85 centimeters for a *kofurisode* (小振袖) to 114
centimeters for an *ōfurisode* (大振袖).[1] The sleeves are attached to
the body of the kimono only for a short distance; the inner edge is open
for the rest of its length, allowing the lining to show on the inner
edge (or both, if the sleeve is left open on the outer edge as well).

Furisode are the most formal style of kimono worn by young unmarried
women in [Japan](Japan "wikilink").[2]

The furisode is made of very fine, brightly colored
[silk](silk "wikilink"),[3] and is commonly rented or bought by parents
for their daughters to wear when celebrating [Coming of Age
Day](Seijin_shiki "wikilink") the year they turn 20. By wearing a
furisode, a young woman signifies that she is both single and a legal
adult, and thus available for [marriage](marriage "wikilink"). In this
sense, a furisode might be likened to the formal
[gowns](evening_gown "wikilink") worn by
[debutantes](debutante "wikilink") in the West.

The furisode is generally worn for formal social functions such as the
[tea ceremony](Japanese_tea_ceremony "wikilink") or
[wedding](wedding "wikilink") ceremonies of relatives. Since furisodes
can be quite expensive, many women rent them as needed rather than
purchasing them.[4]

## History

![](Yōshū_Chikanobu_Azuma_Hanami.jpg "fig:Yōshū_Chikanobu_Azuma_Hanami.jpg")
The furisode originated in the mid-1500s as middle- and upper-class
children's clothing for both sexes; it was not worn by adults.[5]
Initially furisode had relatively short sleeves and was used as everyday
wear by those who could afford to do so; over time as the sleeves became
more exaggerated it became an elegant form of dress worn mainly on
special occasions. According to a 17th-century text, boys could wear
furisode until their 18th year or until they went through their
[coming-of-age ceremony](Genpuku "wikilink") (which usually occurred in
late adolescence), while girls were supposed to cease wearing it upon
marriage or reaching their 20th year.[6] Initially furisode did not
differ noticeably between the sexes, but fabric designs started to
become more gendered in the 19th century.[7] In the 20th century
furisode became restricted to women and girls only, as part of the
increasing gender-specificity of children's clothing that developed in
the wake of Western influence.[8] As the furisode became increasingly
associated with young adult women, the term was removed from the
shorter-sleeved children's garment, which acquired the more generic term
*wakiake* (open-sided).[9]
