![](Faldetta_1.jpg "fig:Faldetta_1.jpg") The **għonnella**, pronounced
"awe-*nel*-la" (pl. *għenienel*, pronounced "ee-*nee*-nal"), sometimes
referred to as a ***Faldetta***, was a form of women's head dress and
[shawl](shawl "wikilink"), or hooded [cloak](cloak "wikilink"), unique
to the [Mediterranean](Mediterranean "wikilink") islands of
[Malta](Malta "wikilink") and [Gozo](Gozo "wikilink"). It originated,
and has some similarities, to the Turkish
*[charshaf](Çarşaf "wikilink")*, but distinguishly had a piece of
cardboard sewn inside (hooded), at the top part above the head. There
was a different blue version in the south-east of Malta, and it was
referred to as *xurqana*.[1] Another in the village of
[Għargħur](Għargħur "wikilink") was referred to as *stamijna*.

It was generally made of cotton or silk, and usually black or some other
dark colour, although from the sixteenth century onwards, noble women
and women from wealthier households frequently wore white or brightly
coloured *għenienel*. The *għonnella* covered the head, and framed but
did not cover the face. The upper part of the *għonnella* was starched
quite stiffly, and given a broad, rounded frame, formed by means of a
board, cane, or whalebone. This gave the *għonnella* a mysterious but
alluring, sail-like appearance.

From a practical perspective, this broad bonnet captured much needed
cooling breezes during the hot [Maltese](Malta "wikilink") summer. On
cooler days, the wearer could wrap the *għonnella* around her face more
tightly, by making a slight adjustment. The lower part of the
*għonnella* could be worn loosely draped around the wearer's bodice and
hips, or more tightly wrapped in the case of inclement weather. It would
typically fall to mid-calf length. While walking, the wearer would hold
one or both sides of the *għonnella* clasped in her right hand.

## Origins

![](RYAN(1910)_Malta_-_pic19_Piazza_Reale,_Valletta.jpg "fig:RYAN(1910)_Malta_-_pic19_Piazza_Reale,_Valletta.jpg")
(then Queen's Square) in [Valletta](Valletta "wikilink") in 1910\]\] The
origins of the *għonnella* are unknown. It has been described as a
"western garment, worn in an eastern fashion."[2]
[Maltese](Maltese_people "wikilink") historians Ciantar and Abela were
of the view that the *għonnella* had evolved from traditional Sicilian
dress:

> *"One cannot deny that the frequent interchange made between the
> Maltese and Sicilians influenced local customs. Sicilian influence may
> be discovered both in the eating habits of the Maltese as well as in
> the costumes worn in Malta. The garb worn by the Maltese women is a
> case in point. The women of Malta wear a long black mantel that flows
> down from the head to the heels. Unlike in Sicily, the
> net*(strascino)*is not worn. Our women of the lower classes wear a
> mantel made of black wool. Noble women, the wives of the Professors of
> Law and Medicine and rich citizens wear mantels made of silk...."*[3]

According to local legend, the *għonnella* was first introduced to
[Malta](Malta "wikilink") in 1224 C.E. as a sign of mourning by the
women of [Celano](Celano "wikilink") in the
[Abruzzi](Abruzzi "wikilink") region of [Italy](Italy "wikilink"),[4]
who were said to have been expelled - first to
[Sicily](Sicily "wikilink"), and then to [Malta](Malta "wikilink") - by
Enrico de Morra, acting on the orders of [Holy Roman
Emperor](Holy_Roman_Emperor "wikilink") [Frederick
II](Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "wikilink"), following the massacre
of their husbands. There is some historical evidence of this event
recorded in the chronicles of Riccardo di San Germano:

> *"Henricus de Morra iussu imperiali Celanenses reuocat ubique
> dispersos, ut ad propria redeant, et redeuntes capit et in Siciliam
> mittit, quos apud Maltam dirigit Imperator."*[5]

An alternate legend, which plays on the similarity between the
*Faldetta* and a traditional nun's habit, suggests that the women of
Malta adopted this costume in 1798, to ward off the unwanted advances of
[Napoleon Bonaparte](Napoleon_Bonaparte "wikilink")'s troops. However,
this theory was dismissed as a fairy tale in a National Geographic essay
about Malta (1935).[6]

According to yet another legend, the *għonnella* developed due to the
strict Canonical requirement (pre-[Vatican Council
II](Vatican_Council_II "wikilink")) that women veil their head before
entering a [Catholic](Catholic "wikilink") church. It is said that
poorer country girls, who could not afford a cloak or shawl, met the
veiling requirement by placing a spare skirt over their head, which
gradually evolved into the *għonnella*. Others speculate that it is a
vernacular modification of the eastern veil; it could also be a local
variation of the Spanish [mantilla](mantilla "wikilink").[7] Ghonnella
from Italian Gonnella, diminutive for Gonna = Skirt.

There are references to the *għonnella* in the early records of the
Knights of St. John ([Order of Malta](Order_of_Malta "wikilink")), and
in eighteenth century travel books. Louis De Boiseglin, historian of the
[Knights of Malta](Knights_of_Malta "wikilink") wrote as follows:

> *"The Maltese women are little, and have beautiful hands and feet.
> They have fine black eyes, though they sometimes appear to squint,
> owing to their always looking out of the same eye; half of the face
> being covered with a sort of veil made of silk called Faldetta, which
> they twist about very gracefully, and arrange with much elegance. The
> women even of the highest rank, unlike their husbands, constantly
> preserve their costume; and any one who should adopt the French
> fashion would make herself very ridiculous. They are extremely fond of
> gold and silver ornaments, and it is not uncommon to see even the
> peasants loaded with trinkets of those metals."*[8]

Victorian illustrator and traveller, [William Henry
Bartlett](William_Henry_Bartlett "wikilink"), was clearly intrigued by
the *Faldetta*, describing it as follows in 1851:

> *"Next, tripping lightly down the steps behind, is a
> [Maltese](Maltese_people "wikilink") lady, enveloped in her elegant
> black silk mantilla, a costume of which it may be said that it renders
> even the ugly attractive, while the pretty become positively
> irresistible: so grave, and yet so piquante, so nun-like, and yet so
> coquettish, are its rustling folds, tastefully drawn round the head,
> so as to throw additional expression into a deep dark eye, and to
> relieve a white-gloved hand, and taper Andalusian foot."*[9]

## Disappearance of the *Għonnella*

For centuries, the *għonnella* was ubiquitous throughout Malta, worn by
virtually all adult Maltese women.[10]

It was so popular that there were many seamstresses whose sole job was
to design, cut and sew *għenienel*.

However, it rapidly fell into disuse in the 1940s and 1950s, following
[World War II](World_War_II "wikilink").[11] By the 1970s, it was rarely
seen,[12] except among the older members of the
[Maltese](Malta "wikilink") lay missionary movement, the [*Societas
Doctrinæ Christianæ*
(M.U.S.E.U.M.)](Society_of_Christian_Doctrine "wikilink"). By the end of
the 20th century, it had disappeared altogether.

The hooded garment took a lot of space, and for this reason it became
impractical to wear on Maltese public buses.[13]
