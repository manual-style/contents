![](Charles,_6th_Dauphin.jpg "fig:Charles,_6th_Dauphin.jpg"), from his
tomb effigy. He is wearing a herigaut with tucked sleeves.\]\] A
**herigaut** is a gown-like garment worn in the [thirteenth and early
fourteenth centuries](1400â€“1500_in_European_fashion "wikilink").[1]
Alternative spellings include herigald, heregaud, gerygoud and
herigans.[2] It was three-quarters to full length with hanging
sleeves.[3] Sometimes the sleeves were
[tucked](tuck_(sewing) "wikilink") at the top to increase fullness
below.[4] Although it was primarily a men's garment, women occasionally
wore it as well.[5] Along with the
[garnache](garnache_(clothing) "wikilink"), it is a variant of the
[garde-corps](garde-corps "wikilink"),[6] and it is also related to the
[houppelande](houppelande "wikilink").[7]
