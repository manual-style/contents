A **himation** (, , [1]) was a type of clothing, a mantle or wrap worn
by ancient Greek men and women from the Archaic through the Hellenistic
periods (c. 750â€“30 BC).

It was usually worn over a [chiton](chiton_(costume) "wikilink") and/or
[peplos](peplos "wikilink"), but was made of heavier drape and played
the role of a [cloak](cloak "wikilink") or [shawl](shawl "wikilink").
When the himation was used alone (without a chiton), and served both as
a chiton and as a cloak, it was called an *achiton*. The himation was
markedly less voluminous than the Roman [toga](toga "wikilink"). It was
usually a large rectangular piece of woollen cloth. Many vase paintings
depict women wearing a himation as a veil covering their faces.[2]

The himation continued into the [Byzantine
era](Byzantine_dress "wikilink") as "iconographic dress" used in art,
worn by Christ, the [Virgin Mary](Virgin_Mary "wikilink"), and biblical
figures.
