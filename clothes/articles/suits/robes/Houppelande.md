**houppelande** or **houpelande** is an outer
[garment](clothing "wikilink"), with a long, full body and flaring
sleeves, that was worn by both men and women in
[Europe](Europe "wikilink") in the late [Middle
Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink"). Sometimes the houppelande was lined with
[fur](fur "wikilink"). The garment was later worn by professional
classes, and has remained in [Western
civilization](Western_culture "wikilink") as the familiar
[academic](academic_dress "wikilink") and legal robes of today.

The houppelande appeared around 1360 and was to remain fashionable well
into the next century.[1] It had its origins in the
[herigaut](herigaut "wikilink"), a similar 13th-century garment with
hanging sleeves.[2] The edges of the houppelande were often *dagged*, or
cut into decorative patterns such as scallops, "embattled" tabs or even
leaf shapes.[3]

## History

The term *houppelande* is of French origin; in England it was called a
*goun*, a term of mockery, and in Italy, a *pellanda*.[4] It is first
mentioned in French royal inventories in 1359 and is thought to have
originated as a man's housecoat worn over the pourpoint.[5]

The woman's and man's houppelande were similar in that both featured
flared sleeves, high collars and voluminous skirts. However, there were
a few key differences. The man's houppelande was belted at the waist,
whereas the woman's was belted beneath the bust.[6] Unlike the woman's
houppelande, which was always floor-length, the man's houppelande could
be of any length. Some men wore houppelandes that extended only as far
as the buttocks, prompting critics to claim that they looked like women
from behind.[7] Longer versions were mostly worn on ceremonial
occasions. A mid-calf version known as the *houppelande à mi-jambe*
gained popularity in the 1400s.[8]
