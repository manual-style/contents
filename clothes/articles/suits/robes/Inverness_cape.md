The **Inverness cape** is a form of weatherproof
[outercoat](overcoat "wikilink"). It is notable for being sleeveless,
the arms emerging from armholes beneath a cape. It has become associated
with the fictional detective [Sherlock
Holmes](Sherlock_Holmes "wikilink").

## History

The garment began in the 1850s[1] as the **Inverness coat**, an
outer-coat with sleeves covered by a long [cape](cape "wikilink"),
reaching the length of the sleeve. By the 1870s, the cape was divided in
two, and a small "capelet"-like "wing" on each side was sewn into the
side seams, not taken across the back.[2] In the 1880s, the sleeves were
removed entirely, and the armholes were cut away beneath the cape to
form the Inverness *cape.*[3][4]

The fronts of the coat may be finished in either of two styles: in one,
the more formal, the topcoat is finished with short lapels and the capes
are set back behind them.[5] In another style, there are no lapels. A
simple fall collar with a tall stand is used, the capes buttoning
across.[6] These were also favoured for less formal wear, particularly
by coachmen and cab drivers, who needed free movement of their arms.
Indeed, this style is usually called a "coachman's cape."

The Inverness cape is a water-repellent garment. The commonly held image
of the [cape](cape "wikilink") as worn by Holmes is one made of
[tweed](Tweed_(cloth) "wikilink"), specifically in a grey
[houndstooth](houndstooth "wikilink") pattern. However, more modest
capes, made of [nylon](nylon "wikilink") or
[twill](twill "wikilink")-weave fabrics and usually black in colour, are
commonly used by members of pipe bands.

## Highland dress

Even though a wide variety of [coats](coat_(clothing) "wikilink"),
[overcoats](overcoat "wikilink"), and rain gear are worn with [Highland
dress](Highland_dress "wikilink") to deal with inclement weather, the
Inverness cape has come to be almost universally adopted for rainy
weather by [pipe bands](Pipes_and_Drums "wikilink") the world over, and
many other [kilt](kilt "wikilink") wearers also find it to be the
preferable garment for such conditions. Unlike most raincoats or other
conventional overcoats, the Inverness cape has no sleeves. Instead, it
has wide-cut armholes in the sides to accommodate the arms. This enables
the wearer to access a [sporran](sporran "wikilink") without unbuttoning
and opening up the cape. The opening in the side is covered by a short
cape, which can be buttoned up in the front.

## In popular culture

![](Statue_of_Sherlock_Holmes_in_Edinburgh.jpg "fig:Statue_of_Sherlock_Holmes_in_Edinburgh.jpg"),
at [Conan Doyle](Conan_Doyle "wikilink")'s birthplace in
[Edinburgh](Edinburgh "wikilink")\]\] Arguably the most famous example
in fiction, [Arthur Conan Doyle's](Arthur_Conan_Doyle's "wikilink")
famous [detective](detective "wikilink") [Sherlock
Holmes](Sherlock_Holmes "wikilink") is often associated with the
Inverness cape.[7] In the Holmes novels, Holmes is described as wearing
an [Ulster](Ulster_coat "wikilink"). Holmes's distinctive look, which
was usually complemented with a [deerstalker
cap](deerstalker "wikilink") and a [calabash
pipe](Smoking_pipe_(tobacco)#Calabash "wikilink"), is a composite of
images, originally credited to illustrator [Sidney
Paget](Sidney_Paget "wikilink"). But as adapted to the stage by the
actor-playwright [William Gillette](William_Gillette "wikilink"), Holmes
did not wear a cape-coat at all, and the origin of the calabash pipe is
something of a mystery, although it might have had something to do with
Gillette's introduction of a full-bend briar pipe for his performances.
Paget had depicted Holmes as smoking straight pipes, exclusively.

Be that as it might, the cape-coat, the deerstalker, and the calabash
pipe were already associated with Holmes by the 1930s, chiefly in the
United States, but the image became definitive with the first two films
in which [Basil Rathbone](Basil_Rathbone "wikilink") appeared on-screen
as Holmes, produced for [20th Century Fox](20th_Century_Fox "wikilink")
in 1939.

[August Derleth](August_Derleth "wikilink")'s [Solar
Pons](Solar_Pons "wikilink"), essentially Sherlock Holmes with a
different name and living in [Praed Street](Praed_Street "wikilink") in
the 1920s, also wears an Inverness.[8]

Inverness capes are worn by characters in many
[Western](Western_(genre) "wikilink") and [Spaghetti
Western](Spaghetti_Western "wikilink") films, such as [Lee Van
Cleef](Lee_Van_Cleef "wikilink")'s character in *[For a Few Dollars
More](For_a_Few_Dollars_More "wikilink")* and [Gianni
Garko](Gianni_Garko "wikilink") in the *[Sartana](Sartana "wikilink")*
series.

In the 1970s of the long-running series *[Doctor
Who](Doctor_Who "wikilink")*, the [Third
Doctor](Third_Doctor "wikilink") ([Jon
Pertwee](Jon_Pertwee "wikilink")), frequently wore an Inverness cape
over his [dandy](dandy "wikilink") suits.

The [vampire](vampire "wikilink") [Barnabas
Collins](Barnabas_Collins "wikilink") (as portrayed by actor [Jonathan
Frid](Jonathan_Frid "wikilink")) wore an Inverness cape on the cult
classic Gothic soap opera *[Dark Shadows](Dark_Shadows "wikilink")*.

The 2001 film adaptation of the
[absurdist](Theatre_of_the_Absurd "wikilink") play *[Waiting for
Godot](Waiting_for_Godot "wikilink")* has landlord
[Pozzo](Pozzo_(Waiting_for_Godot) "wikilink") (played by [Alan
Stanford](Alan_Stanford "wikilink")) wearing an Inverness cape,
symbolising the [Protestant
Ascendancy](Protestant_Ascendancy "wikilink") landlords of Ireland.

Still worn in the United Kingdom, the Inverness cape is often made of
heavy [Harris tweed](Harris_tweed "wikilink") of plaid and checked
designs. It is usually worn for country wear. Lighter weight black
cape-coats are more associated with formal evening attire.

Popular [urban fantasy](urban_fantasy "wikilink") hero [Harry
Dresden](Harry_Dresden "wikilink") of *[The Dresden
Files](The_Dresden_Files "wikilink")* by [Jim
Butcher](Jim_Butcher "wikilink") replaced his trademark
[duster](duster_(clothing) "wikilink") with an Inverness coat in *Cold
Days*, the 14th book of the series.

[Steampunk](Steampunk "wikilink") fashion has revived the wearing of the
Inverness cape to a limited extent.[9]
