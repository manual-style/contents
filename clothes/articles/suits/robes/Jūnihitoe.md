![](Junihitoe.jpg "fig:Junihitoe.jpg") The - lit. "the twelve layers" -
was the style of formal court dress worn by
[ladies-in-waiting](Lady-in-waiting "wikilink") at the Japanese Imperial
Court in the [Heian period](Heian_period "wikilink"). The *jūnihitoe*,
despite the name, varied in its exact number of layers,[1] and was
composed of several different [kimono](kimono "wikilink")-style
garments.

The *jūnihitoe* first appeared some time around the 10th century;
however, by the [Kamakura period](Kamakura_period "wikilink"), the
number of layers worn by artistocratic ladies, even in court, had been
reduced heavily, and by the [Muromachi
period](Muromachi_period "wikilink"), it had disappeared entirely.

In the present day, the *jūnihitoe* is still worn by members of the
[Imperial House of Japan](Imperial_House_of_Japan "wikilink") on
important occasions.

### The layers of jūnihitoe

The term *jūnihitoe* is the common name rather than the formal name for
the set of clothing and accouterments that are worn together.[2] The
layers of clothing may be known by separate names, such as *hitoe*
(unlined robe), *itsutsuginu* (五衣) which is a series of robes (usually
5 and of different colours),[3] a short coat *karaginu* (唐衣), and *mo*
(裳). The last three terms can be combined to give the formal name for
the *jūnihitoe* set of clothing – *itsutsuginu-karaginu-mo*
(五衣唐衣裳).[4] The layers of the *jūnihitoe* consist of:[5]

-   The undergarments: Usually a two-piece cotton or silk garment.
-   *[Kosode](Kosode "wikilink")*: A short silk red or white robe of
    ankle or lower calf length.
-   *[Nagabakama](Hakama "wikilink")*: The formal version of
    *[hakama](hakama "wikilink")* worn by noble women; it is a very long
    red pleated split skirt.
-   *[Hitoe](Hitoe "wikilink")*: An unlined silk robe; usually red,
    white or blue-green, although other colors (such as dark red-violet
    or dark green) very rarely occur.
-   *[itsutsuginu](itsutsuginu "wikilink")*: A series of brightly
    coloured robes or *[uchigi](uchigi "wikilink")*, usually 5 or
    sometimes 6, which create a layered effect. Many more layers of
    *uchigi* were worn during the Heian period until the government
    enacted [sumptuary laws](sumptuary_laws "wikilink") reducing the
    number of layers worn.[6][7]
-   *[Uchiginu](Uchiginu "wikilink")*: A beaten scarlet silk robe worn
    as a stiffener and support for the outer robes.
-   *[Uwagi](Uwagi "wikilink")*: A patterned woven and decorated silk
    robe than is shorter and narrower than the *Uchiginu*. The colour
    and fabric used for the *uwagi* indicate the rank of the wearer.
-   *Karaginu*: A waist length [Chinese
    style](Han_Chinese_clothing "wikilink") jacket.
-   "[Mo](Mo_(train) "wikilink")": An apron-like train, down the back of
    the robe. White with painted/embroidered adornment.

On less formal occasions, *[kouchigi](kouchig "wikilink")* (lit., "small
cloak"), a shorter brocade robe may be worn over the *uchigi* or *uwagi*
to add some formality on occasions when the *karaginu* and *mo* are not
worn.[8][9] However, *karaginu* and *mo* must be worn for the
*jūnihitoe* to be considered the formal attire of the most noble
women.[10]

### Colours and arrangements

The colours and the arrangements of the layers have particular
significance in *jūnihitoe*. The only place where the layers are
discernible is around the [sleeves](sleeve "wikilink"), hems and the
neck. During the Heian period, a woman may be sat hidden behind a
*[sudare](sudare "wikilink")* screen with only the lower part of the
body and sleeve edges visible to an outsider. The layers of colours may
be used to represent the woman herself, and the arrangements of the
layers and their colours were a good indication to an outsider what
taste and what rank the lady had. The colour combinations, termed
*kasane no irome* (襲の色目, "layers of colours"),[11] may have poetic
names that refer to plants, such as "crimson plum of the spring". A name
"under the snow" may have a layer of green representing leaves, layers
of pink, with white on top to represent snow. The colour combinations
changed with the seasons (of which there were 72 in the old calendar),
and a wearer may change the gowns just before the flowers of a seasonal
plant actually bloom. The appropriate use of colour gave an indication
of the cultured and refined taste of the wearer.[12]

Apart from their robes, Japanese court ladies of the Heian era also wore
their hair very long, only cut at the sides of their faces in a layered
fashion; the longer hair was sometimes worn tied back. The hair
arrangement is referred to as *suberakashi* (垂髪), and an ornament may
be worn on the forehead.

### Accessories

An important [accessory](Fashion_accessory "wikilink") is an elaborate
[fan](fan_(implement) "wikilink"), which could be tied together by a
rope when folded. This was used by the lady not only to cool herself,
since it could get very hot, but it was also an important communication
device. Since a lady was not allowed to speak face-to-face to a male
outsider, she could hold her sleeve up or use her opened fan to shield
herself from inquiring looks. Communication to a suitor had to follow
with her normally hiding behind the *[sudare](sudare "wikilink")*
(screen or blinds) in any case. The suitor could only see the sleeves of
her *jūnihitoe* that were peeking underneath the blinds. This practice
was prominent during the Heian-Era as described in the *[Tale of
Genji](Tale_of_Genji "wikilink")*.

## Contemporary use

![](Crown_Prince_Akihito_&_Michiko_Shoda_Wedding_1959-4.jpg "fig:Crown_Prince_Akihito_&_Michiko_Shoda_Wedding_1959-4.jpg"),
then *Crown Princess*, wearing a *Jūnihitoe*, 10 April 1959\]\] Today,
the *jūnihitoe* can only normally be seen in museums, movies, costume
demonstrations, tourist attractions or at certain festivals. These robes
are one of the most expensive items of Japanese clothing. Only the
[Imperial Household](Imperial_Household_of_Japan "wikilink") still
officially uses them at some important functions. Women such as an
empress or princess wear a jūnihitoe, while men such as the Emperor or a
prince wear a [sokutai](sokutai "wikilink"). During the wedding of
[Empress Masako](Empress_Masako "wikilink") to the crown prince, she
wore a *jūnihitoe* for the official ceremony. The *jūnihitoe* was also
worn by [Empress Michiko](Empress_Michiko "wikilink") during the
[enthronement](Enthronement_of_the_Japanese_Emperor "wikilink") ceremony
of [Emperor Akihito](Emperor_Akihito "wikilink") in 1990. Her
ladies-in-waiting were all wearing the *jūnihitoe*; however, in modified
form from the [Edo period](Edo_period "wikilink"), not the Heian style.

The [Saiō Matsuri](Saiō_Matsuri "wikilink") *Saiō Festival* is held
every in [Meiwa, Mie](Meiwa,_Mie "wikilink") and showcases Heian era
dresses. They are also featured at the [Aoi
Matsuri](Aoi_Matsuri "wikilink") in [Kyoto](Kyoto "wikilink").
