![](Kurd_Man.png "fig:Kurd_Man.png") man wearing a kaftan\]\] A
**kaftan** or **caftan** (; *kheftan*) is a variant of the
[robe](robe "wikilink") or [tunic](tunic "wikilink"), and has been worn
in a number of cultures around the world for thousands of years and is
of [Asiatic](Asia "wikilink") origin. In Russian usage, *kaftan* instead
refers to a style of men's long suit with tight sleeves. Used by many
Middle Eastern ethnic groups, the kaftan is ancient
[Mesopotamian](Mesopotamian "wikilink") (modern day
[Iraq](Iraq "wikilink")) in origin. It may be made of
[wool](wool "wikilink"), [cashmere](cashmere_wool "wikilink"),
[silk](silk "wikilink"), or [cotton](cotton "wikilink"), and may be worn
with a [sash](sash "wikilink").

Styles, uses, and names for the kaftan vary from culture to culture. The
kaftan is often worn as a [coat](Coat_(clothing) "wikilink") or as an
overdress, usually having long sleeves and reaching to the ankles. In
regions with a warm climate, it is worn as a light-weight, loose-fitting
garment. In some cultures, the kaftan has served as a symbol of royalty.

## Ottoman Kaftan

![](Semailname_47b.jpg "fig:Semailname_47b.jpg") [Suleiman the
Magnificent](Suleiman_the_Magnificent "wikilink") in a kaftan of complex
woven fabric.\]\] Kaftans were worn by the
[sultans](List_of_sultans_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") of the
[Ottoman Empire](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink"). Decoration on the garment,
including colours, patterns, ribbons, and buttons, indicated the rank of
the person who wore it. From the 14th century through the 17th century,
textiles with large patterns were used. By the late 16th and early 17th
centuries, decorative patterns on the fabrics had become smaller and
brighter. By the second half of the 17th century, the most precious
kaftans were those with 'yollu': vertical stripes with varying
embroidery and small patterns – the so-called "Selimiye" fabrics.

Most fabrics manufactured in Turkey were made in
[Istanbul](Istanbul "wikilink") and [Bursa](Bursa,_Turkey "wikilink"),
but some textiles came from as far away as [Venice](Venice "wikilink"),
[Genoa](Genoa "wikilink"), [Persia (Iran)](Iran "wikilink"),
[India](India "wikilink"), and even [China](China "wikilink"). Kaftans
were made from velvet, *aba*, *bürümcük* (a type of crepe with a silk
warp and cotton weft), *canfes*, *çatma* (a heavy silk
[brocade](brocade "wikilink")), *gezi*, *diba* (), *hatayi*, *kutnu*,
*kemha*, *seraser* (Persian ) (brocade fabric with silk warp and gold or
silver metallic thread weft),[1] *serenk*, *zerbaft* (Persian ), and
*tafta* (Persian ). Favoured colours were [indigo](indigo "wikilink")
blue, [kermes](Kermes_(dye) "wikilink") red, violet, *pişmis ayva* or
"cooked quince", and [weld yellow](Reseda_luteola "wikilink").

The [Topkapi Palace Museum](Topkapı_Palace "wikilink") in
[Istanbul](Istanbul "wikilink") holds a large collection of Ottoman
kaftans and textiles.[2]

### Morocco

Although the Ottoman Empire never set foot in
[Morocco](Morocco "wikilink") -- suggesting that the Moroccan Kaftan
pre-dates Ottoman rule -- kaftans in Morocco were tailored and
re-fashioned by Moroccan cloth makers ("Maalem") during the [Marinid
Dynasty](Marinid_dynasty "wikilink") and were worn by the kings of the
region. The use of kaftans as a form of dress was later adopted by the
wider public during the [Saadian Dynasty](Saadi_dynasty "wikilink") and
worn especially by Moroccan women.[3].

Fes city, from the in beginning of the 13th century (around 600 Hijri in
the [Islamic calendar](Islamic_calendar "wikilink")), the city of
[Fez](Fez,_Morocco "wikilink") was popular known by for it's textile
factories, with of number 3,046 of textile factories at that time.[4]
andThe at sultans the of time Morocco's of Al-Marinid Dynasty, dynasty
Sultans sent of a Morocco sent Kaftans of [brocade](brocade "wikilink")
as a gift to Ottoman Sultans for each one become the new Sultan of the
Ottoman Empire, and to this Kaftan was made by brocard, which make it be
the first kaftan that is owned by the Ottoman Sultan.[5].

Today in Morocco, kaftans are mostly worn by women and the word kaftan
in Morocco is commonly used to mean "one-piece dress". Alternative
two-piece versions of Moroccan kaftans are called
[Takchita](Takchita "wikilink") and worn with a large belt. The
[Takchita](Takchita "wikilink") is also known as **Mansouria** which
derives from the name of Sultan [Ahmad
al-Mansur](Ahmad_al-Mansur "wikilink")[6] who invented Al-Mansouria and
the new fashion of wearing a two-piece Kaftan[7].

Historically, there are many Moroccan Kaftans, depending on the cities,
such as [Tetouan](Tetouan "wikilink"), [Fes](Fes "wikilink"),
[Rabat](Rabat "wikilink"), [Sale](Salé "wikilink") and
[Marrakech](Marrakech "wikilink"). They may be made of brocade, velvet,
silk and many other fabrics.[8]

Kaftans can be worn on both casual and formal occasions, depending on
the materials used.[9]

## West African Kaftan

In [West Africa](West_Africa "wikilink"), a kaftan is a pullover robe,
worn by both men and women. The women's robe is called a
[kaftan](wrapper_(clothing) "wikilink"), and the men's garment is
referred to as a Senegalese kaftan.

A Senegalese kaftan is a pullover men's robe with long bell-like
sleeves. In the [Wolof language](Wolof_language "wikilink"), this robe
is called a *mbubb* and in French, it is called a *boubou*. The
Senegalese kaftan is an ankle-length garment, and is worn with matching
drawstring pants called *tubay*. Usually made of cotton brocade, lace,
or synthetic fabrics, these robes are common throughout West Africa. A
kaftan and matching pants are called a kaftan suit. The kaftan suit is
worn with a [kufi cap](Kufi "wikilink").[10] Senegalese kaftans are
formal wear in all West African countries.

wearing kaftans (circa 1910).\]\]

### Persian

Persian kaftan robes of honour were commonly known as
[khalat](khalat "wikilink") or kelat.[11]

### Jewish

[Hasidic Jewish culture](Hasidic_Judaism "wikilink") adapted a silky
robe (*[bekishe](bekishe "wikilink")*) or [frock
coat](frock_coat "wikilink") (*kapoteh*) from the garb of Slavic
nobility (Polish)[12], which was itself a type of kaftan. The term
[*kapoteh*](:he:קפוטה "wikilink") may originate from the Spanish
*capote* or possibly from "kaftan" via
[Ladino](Judaeo-Spanish "wikilink"). [Sephardic
Jews](Sephardic_Jews "wikilink") from Muslim countries wore a kaftan
similar to those of their neighbours.

### Russian

In [Russia](Russia "wikilink"), the word "kaftan" is used for another
type of clothing: a style of men's long suit with tight sleeves. People
of various [Slavic](Slavs "wikilink") tribes and also the
[Baltic](Balts "wikilink"), [Turkic](Turkic_peoples "wikilink"),
[Varangian](Varangians "wikilink") ([Vikings](Vikings "wikilink")) and
[Iranian](Iranian_peoples "wikilink") people which inhabited todays
Russia before modern Russian people emerged worn kaftan-like clothing
already in ancient times in regions where later the [Rus'
Khaganate](Rus'_Khaganate "wikilink") and [Kievan
Rus'](Kievan_Rus' "wikilink") states appeared.

Important places which the Rus' people inhabited were the [Volga
river,](Volga_River "wikilink") [Dnieper river](Dnieper "wikilink"),
[Staraya Russa](Staraya_Russa "wikilink"),
[Gnezdovo](Gnezdovo "wikilink"), [Staraya
Ladoga](Staraya_Ladoga "wikilink") and [Kiev](Kiev "wikilink").
Furthermore the kaftan was known on the island of
[Björkö](Björkö,_Ekerö "wikilink") (literally: "Birch Island") in
present-day [Sweden](Sweden "wikilink").

Russian kaftan was influenced or brought probably by Persian or Turkic
people to Old Russia.[13] The word "kaftan" was adopted from the Tatar
language, which in turn borrowed the word from Persia.[14] In 13th the
kaftan was common in Russia. In 19th century Russian kaftans were the
most widespread type of outer clothing among peasants and merchants in
Old Russia. Currently, they are used as ritual religious clothing by the
most conservative people of [Old Believers](Old_Believers "wikilink"),
in Russian fashion and [Russian
folklore](Folklore_of_Russia "wikilink").[15]

### Southeast Asian

In [Southeast Asia](Southeast_Asia "wikilink"), the kaftan was
originally worn by [Arab
traders](Southeast_Asia#Spread_of_Islam "wikilink"), as seen in early
lithographs and photographs from the region. Religious communities that
formed as Islam became established later adopted this style of dress as
a distinguishing feature, under a variety of names deriving from Arabic
and Persian such as "[jubah](Thawb "wikilink")", a robe, and "cadar", a
veil or [chador](chador "wikilink").[16]

## In Western countries

<img src="Hippie_trail.svg" title="fig:Hippie_trail.svg" width="250" alt="Hippie_trail.svg" />
helped popularise the kaftan.\]\] More recently, the kaftan was
introduced to the west in the 1890s when [Alix of
Hesse](Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse) "wikilink") wore the
traditional Russian kaftan during her coronation.[17] This garment
resembled the kaftans worn by the Ottoman sultans, and was in contrast
to the tight-fitting, [corseted](corset "wikilink") dresses common in
England at that time.

The kaftan slowly gained popularity, for its exoticism and as a form of
loose-fitting clothing. French fashion designer [Paul
Poiret](Paul_Poiret "wikilink") further popularised this style in the
early 20th century.

In the 1950s, fashion designers such as [Christian
Dior](Christian_Dior "wikilink") and [Balenciaga](Balenciaga "wikilink")
adopted the kaftan as a loose evening gown or robe in their
collections.[18] These variations were usually sashless.

American [hippie](hippie "wikilink") fashions of the late 1960s and the
1970s often drew inspiration from ethnic styles, including kaftans.
These styles were brought to the United States by people who journeyed
the so-called "[hippie trail](hippie_trail "wikilink")".[19]
African-styled, kaftan-like [dashikis](dashiki "wikilink") were popular,
especially among [African-Americans](African-American "wikilink").
Street styles were appropriated by fashion designers, who marketed
lavish, Moroccan-style kaftans as hostess gowns for casual at-home
entertaining.

[Diana Vreeland](Diana_Vreeland "wikilink"), [Babe
Paley](Babe_Paley "wikilink"), and [Barbara
Hutton](Barbara_Hutton "wikilink") all helped popularise the caftan in
mainstream western fashion.[20] Into the 1970s, [Elizabeth
Taylor](Elizabeth_Taylor "wikilink") often wore kaftans designed by
[Thea Porter](Thea_Porter "wikilink"). In 1975, for her second wedding
to Richard Burton she wore a kaftan designed by [Gina
Fratini](Gina_Fratini "wikilink").[21]

More recently, in 2011 [Jessica Simpson](Jessica_Simpson "wikilink") was
photographed wearing kaftans during her pregnancy.[22] American fashion
editor [André Leon Talley](André_Leon_Talley "wikilink") has also worn
kaftans designed by [Ralph Rucci](Ralph_Rucci "wikilink") as one of his
signature looks.[23] Beyoncé, Uma Thurman, Susan Sarandon, Kate Moss,
Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, and Nicole Richie have all been seen wearing
the style.[24] Some fashion lines have dedicated collections to the
kaftan, one example being the [Willian by Keia
Bounds](Willian_by_Keia_Bounds "wikilink") 2015 Summer Collection.[25]

For forward thinking fashion brands, Kaftans have been included as part
of summer season lines for noted labels such as Roberto Cavalli, House
Of Inoa Fashion and TheSwankStore which in turn has seen the kaftan
dress gain popularity as a womenswear staple for those visiting tropical
holiday destinations. Often made from silk & finished with crystals &
beading embellishments on the neckline & back of the garments, the many
and varied kaftan styles are often referred to as modern, luxury
resortwear, with the term 'kaftans' making up a generic name,
encompassing the style genre. Normally made with bright, colourful &
unique print designs referencing traditional middle eastern & Indian
cultures fused with on trend colour palettes & styles, these modern
colourful outfits have begun to transcend use as resort only fashion
items but as occasion wear items or as day to day wear,
