A **kamleika** is an [Aleut](Aleut_people "wikilink") robe made from
[sea mammal](marine_mammal "wikilink") (mostly sea otter) intestine,
which was light and [waterproof](waterproof "wikilink"). They also
sometimes had robes to protect against threats such as heavy
[wind](wind "wikilink") and [rain](rain "wikilink"). They were sewn with
grass, and each took around a month to make.[1]

Another type of kamleikas were made as ceremonial robes, and were much
more decorative than the hunting kind. These did not have hoods, and had
beads all over the robe. After contact with
[Russians](Russia "wikilink") and [Europeans](Europe "wikilink"), they
were given as gifts.[2]

The Russians called traditional [Aleut](Aleut_people "wikilink") gut
garments kamleikas; this word has been borrowed into Yup'ik from the
Russian as *kamliikaq*,[3] and that word has been used generally for any
gut garment.[4]
