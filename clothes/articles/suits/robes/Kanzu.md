![](Kanzu.jpg "fig:Kanzu.jpg").\]\] A **kanzu** is a white or cream
coloured robe worn by men in the [African Great
Lakes](African_Great_Lakes "wikilink") region. It is referred to as a
**tunic** in English, and as the **[Thawb](Thawb "wikilink")** in Arab
countries. The kanzu is an ankle or floor length garment. It serves as
the [national costume](national_costume "wikilink") of
[Tanzania](Tanzania "wikilink") as well as the
[Comoros](Comoros "wikilink"), where it is called/pronounced 'Kandu' as
well as thawb. The robe is also worn in some coastal
[Muslim](Muslim "wikilink") regions of [Tanzania](Tanzania "wikilink")
and [Kenya](Kenya "wikilink"). The men of [Uganda](Uganda "wikilink") in
[Uganda](Uganda "wikilink") consider it their most important dress.
Kanzu is a [Ganda](Ganda_language "wikilink") word of
[Swahili](Swahili_language "wikilink") origin, which means "robe" or
"tunic". In Tanzania, the term is used interchangeably with
[kaftan](kaftan "wikilink").[1]

## Ugandan kanzu

The [Kiganda](Buganda "wikilink")/[Ugandan](Uganda "wikilink") kanzu was
introduced to the Buganda Kingdom by [Arab](Arab "wikilink") traders.[2]
Kabaka Ssuuna was the first [Kabaka of
Buganda](Kabaka_of_Buganda "wikilink") to wear the kanzu. After the
Kabaka adopted the attire it became the [formal
wear](formal_wear "wikilink") of all [Baganda](Baganda "wikilink") men.
The kanzu spread from the [Baganda](Baganda "wikilink") people to other
ethnicities and is a [national costume](national_costume "wikilink") of
Baganda men. (The Republic of Uganda has no national costume for men).

It is a variation of the Arabic [thobe](Thawb "wikilink"). Originally,
the kanzu was made from [barkcloth](barkcloth "wikilink"). Today the
kanzu is made from [silk](silk "wikilink"), [cotton](cotton "wikilink"),
[poplin](poplin "wikilink"), or [linen](linen "wikilink"). Linen kanzus
are the most expensive. The main difference between the kanzu and the
Arabic [thobe](Thawb "wikilink") is the design.

The traditional kanzu has maroon embroidery around the collar, abdomen,
and sleeves. The embroidery is called the **omulela**. The major center
of kanzu knitting and production is Mende, Uganda.

The kanzu is worn at [wedding](wedding "wikilink") ceremonies during the
introduction, also known as the [Kwanjula](Kwanjula "wikilink"). During
the [Kwanjula](Kwanjula "wikilink") the groom's family is required to
appear dressed in kanzu and they must also present a kanzu to the
bride's family.

The kanzu is worn with a [suit jacket](suit_jacket "wikilink"),
[blazer](blazer "wikilink"), or [sport coat](sport_coat "wikilink"). It
is customary for important persons to wear the kanzu with a black
[bisht](Bisht_(clothing) "wikilink"). Traditional attire for women in
Baganda is the [Gomesi](Gomesi "wikilink").

In popular culture, Ugandan clothing was featured in the controversial
film, *[The Last King of
Scotland](The_Last_King_of_Scotland_(film) "wikilink")*.

## Tanzanian kanzu

In [Tanzania](Tanzania "wikilink"), the kanzu was introduced by
[Arab](Arab "wikilink") traders and missionaries from
[Oman](Oman "wikilink") who were conducting [dawah](dawah "wikilink").
The Tanzanian kanzu is identical to the Arabic
[thobe](Thawb "wikilink"). Originally, the kanzu was made from
[silk](silk "wikilink"). Today, due to [Islamic](Islam "wikilink")
restrictions on silk garments, it is made from
[polyester](polyester "wikilink") or other synthetic fabrics made to
resemble silk. The distinctive feature of the Tanzanian kanzu is the
[tassel](tassel "wikilink") that hangs from the collar. In some
families, the tassel is [perfumed](perfume "wikilink") with African oils
or Arabic [attar](Ittar "wikilink") (oils) before
[wedding](wedding "wikilink") ceremonies. The kanzu is always worn with
a [kofia](Kofia_(hat) "wikilink"), a small embroidered cap.[3]

In the West, and in many Arab countries, the Tanzanian kanzu is sold by
merchants as an *Omani thobe*, *Yemini dishdasha*, or *Emirati thobe*.
The best quality kanzus are manufactured in the [United Arab
Emirates](United_Arab_Emirates "wikilink"). HKT is one manufacturer.
[Saudi](Saudi_Arabia "wikilink") and inexpensive Chinese made versions
are common. ![](Kofia.JPG "fig:Kofia.JPG") (cap).\]\] Among the
[Swahili](Swahili_people "wikilink") men of Tanzania and
[Kenya](Kenya "wikilink"), the kanzu is always worn with a [suit
jacket](suit_jacket "wikilink"), [blazer](blazer "wikilink"), or [sport
coat](sport_coat "wikilink").[4] For [formal
wear](formal_wear "wikilink") a Tanzanian man will don a kanzu, a suit
jacket, and a [kofia](Kofia_(hat) "wikilink") (cap).[5] [Tribal
chiefs](Tribal_chief "wikilink") wear the kanzu with a black
[bisht](Bisht_(clothing) "wikilink") when attending a black tie event. A
white or ivory [bisht](Bisht_(clothing) "wikilink") is worn to [white
tie](white_tie "wikilink") events. In many Western countries, the bisht
is sold by merchants as a *Saudi abaya* or *Abayah*. According to
custom, a kanzu must be *crisp*, that is [dry
cleaned](dry_cleaning "wikilink") and [starched](Ironing "wikilink"),
before it is suitable for formal wear.

The kanzu is the [national costume](national_costume "wikilink") of
[Tanzania](Tanzania "wikilink"), and is the [formal
wear](formal_wear "wikilink") of most of the tribes in the country. For
informal events, a Saudi manufactured [thobe](Thawb "wikilink") with a
[mandarin collar](mandarin_collar "wikilink") or the
[dashiki](dashiki "wikilink") shirt and a
[kofia](Kofia_(hat) "wikilink") is the traditional attire. Although the
Tanzanian kanzu was borrowed from Arab culture, it is worn by all
religious faiths, including [Christians](Christians "wikilink"),
[Muslims](Muslim "wikilink"), [African Jews](African_Jews "wikilink"),
and members of [African traditional
religions](African_traditional_religion "wikilink").

## Kenya

In [Kenya](Kenya "wikilink"), the Tanzanian Kanzu is worn by Muslims of
all tribes. Christians wear the kanzu (rarely)for informal events,
including church services, but the [dashiki](dashiki "wikilink") shirt
or [kitenge](kitenge "wikilink") shirt is used as [formal
wear](formal_wear "wikilink") for Christian weddings. Both religious
communities wear a [kofia](Kofia_(hat) "wikilink"), a small cap with the
kanzu. In Kenya, it is customary for [Tribal
chiefs](Tribal_chief "wikilink") and Muslim [Imams](Imam "wikilink") to
wear a black [bisht](Bisht_(clothing) "wikilink") with the kanzu when
attending a formal event. Kenya is unique among African nations in that
it is the only country that does not have a [national
costume](national_costume "wikilink").[6] In fact, many Kenyan men wear
European [suits](suit_(clothing) "wikilink") or
[tuxedos](black_tie "wikilink") for weddings and other formal events.
Others have started to wear the Nigerian national costume which is
called an [Agbada](Boubou_(clothing) "wikilink").[7] In Kenya, male
Members of the Parliament are required to wear a European style suit to
sessions.[8]

## West Africa

In [West Africa](West_Africa "wikilink"), similar yet highly distinct
clothing are worn by predominantly [Sahelian](Sahel "wikilink") peoples.
These include the [Senegalese kaftan](Senegalese_kaftan "wikilink") and
the [Boubou](Boubou_(clothing) "wikilink") (often worn on formal
occasions).

## Wedding attire

The kanzu is the traditional wedding attire for men in the Great Lakes
region. During wedding ceremonies it is customary for the groom to wear
a white kanzu and a [kofia](kofia_(hat) "wikilink"). In Tanzania and
Kenya, the groom wears a black or white
[bisht](bisht_(clothing) "wikilink") on top of the kanzu. The groomsmen
and other men who are members of the wedding party wear the kanzu with a
suit jacket. In Uganda, the groom wears a suit jacket on top of the
kanzu, and the bride's attire is the [gomesi](gomesi "wikilink").

In Tanzania and Kenya, the bride's attire is a white [wedding
dress](wedding_dress "wikilink") or the West African
[boubou](Wrapper_(clothing) "wikilink"). Use of wedding attire
characteristic of the Great Lakes region has spread throughout the
[African diaspora](African_diaspora "wikilink"). There are also some
locals who prefer to wed in West African attire (see the
[dashiki](dashiki "wikilink")).
