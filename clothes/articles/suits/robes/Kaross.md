A **kaross** is a [cloak](cloak "wikilink") made of
[sheepskin](sheepskin "wikilink"), or the hide of other animals, with
the hair left on. It is properly confined to the coat of skin without
sleeves and used to be worn by the [Khoikhoi](Khoikhoi "wikilink") and
[Bushmen / San](Bushmen "wikilink") peoples of [South
Africa](South_Africa "wikilink"). These karosses became replaced by a
blanket. Their chiefs wore karosses of the skin of the wild cat,
[leopard](leopard "wikilink") or [caracal](caracal "wikilink"). The word
is also loosely applied to the cloaks of leopard-skin worn by the chiefs
and principal men of several southern African tribes. Kaross is probably
either a genuine Khoikhoi word, or else an adaptation of the Dutch kuras
(), a cuirass. In a vocabulary dated 1673 "karos" is described as a
"corrupt Dutch word."

These days the kaross is a common tourist item, being made of various
animal hides including cowhide. The term is loosely applied in modern
times to fur blankets sold as bedding. These "karosses" often have
panels of different types of animal fur sewn into them in order to make
a decorative pattern.
