(1880-1944), emir of [Bukhara](Bukhara "wikilink"), wearing a khalat\]\]
A **khalat** ( / [ALA-LC](ALA-LC "wikilink"): *xalat*) is a loose,
long-sleeved outer [silk](silk "wikilink") or
[cotton](cotton "wikilink") [robe](robe "wikilink") common in [Central
Asia](Central_Asia "wikilink"), [Pakistan](Pakistan "wikilink") and
northern [India](India "wikilink") and worn both by men and women,
although in differing styles.

Historically, richly adorned khalats have been used as honorific
[awards](award "wikilink"), similarly to
[mantle](Mantle_(vesture) "wikilink"). The word khalat/khilat was also
used to denote the ceremony of awarding the honorific robe. Such [social
aspects of clothing](social_aspects_of_clothing "wikilink") have been
known in many societies. By the 19th century in [British
India](British_India "wikilink") the word *khillat* had come to mean any
gift of money or goods awarded by the Government of India in return for
service from tributary princes, khans and tribal leaders.

Central Asian khalats can be a thin, decorative garment, or thick, full
length robe, and good protection from both exposure to heat and light
and the cold.

The word *khalat* is one of many borrowings to be found in
[Russian](Russian_language "wikilink"), where it has come to be a
generic term for various robes. In Romanian the word is *halat* is used,
meaning [dressing gown](dressing_gown "wikilink"),
[bathrobe](bathrobe "wikilink"), [smock](smock_(garment) "wikilink"),
[camouflage](camouflage "wikilink") [cloak](cloak "wikilink"), etc. A
similar garment is known as [Chapan](Chapan "wikilink") in Turkic.

The khalat (sometimes called *khlat* in [Yiddish](Yiddish "wikilink"))
was also worn by [Ashkenazi](Ashkenazi "wikilink") Jewish men in Eastern
Europe, until the early 20th century. These were long, close-fitting
coats with [shawl collars](Lapel#Shawl_lapel "wikilink") and pockets. In
Jewish communities, these were cotton garments meant for everyday wear;
more luxurious versions were made of velvet or silk and worn for
[Shabbat](Shabbat "wikilink") or other
[holidays](Jewish_holidays "wikilink").[1]
