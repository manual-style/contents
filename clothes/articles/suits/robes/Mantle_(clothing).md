back views. *[Harper's Bazaar](Harper's_Bazaar "wikilink")*, November
1871\]\] A **mantle** (from [old French](old_French "wikilink")
*mantel*, from *mantellum*, the [Latin](Latin "wikilink") term for a
[cloak](cloak "wikilink")) is a type of loose
[garment](garment "wikilink") usually worn over indoor
[clothing](clothing "wikilink") to serve the same purpose as an
[overcoat](overcoat "wikilink"). Technically, the term describes a long,
loose [cape](cape "wikilink")-like cloak worn from the 12th to the 16th
century by both sexes, although by the 19th century, it was used to
describe any loose-fitting, shaped outer garment similar to a cape.[1]
For example, the [dolman](dolman "wikilink"), a 19th-century cape-like
woman's garment with partial sleeves is often described as a mantle.[2]

In English, the idiom "to take up/pick up/assume the mantle" is from the
[Bible](Bible "wikilink"), and means to take a position of authority,
leadership or responsibility in a particular area, especially in the
sense of carrying on for a previous figure.[3]

## Mantelets

![](1895_mantelet.jpg "1895_mantelet.jpg")

A variation on the mantle is the **mantelet** (also spelled **mantelot**
and **mantlet**), typically describing a short version of the mantle.
The term appears as early as 1386, in "[The Knight's
Tale](The_Knight's_Tale "wikilink")" by [Geoffrey
Chaucer](Geoffrey_Chaucer "wikilink"). In the 18th century, a mantelet
was a woman's short cloak, and in the early 19th century, it was an
ornamental [scarf](scarf "wikilink") that crossed over the chest and
tied behind, usually made of [fur](fur "wikilink") or
[lace](lace "wikilink").[4] By the end of the 19th century, a mantelet
was a woman's shoulder cape with elongated ends in front, sometimes held
in position by a belt at the waist.[5]
