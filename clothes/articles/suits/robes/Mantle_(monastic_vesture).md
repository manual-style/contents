A **mantle** (; [Church Slavonic](Church_Slavonic "wikilink"): мантия,
***mantiya***) is an ecclesiastical garment in the form of a very full
cape that extends to the floor, joined at the neck, that is worn over
the outer garments.

In the [Eastern Orthodox Church](Eastern_Orthodox_Church "wikilink") and
the [Eastern Catholic churches](Eastern_Catholic_Churches "wikilink"),
the mantle is a monastic garment worn by [bishops](bishop "wikilink"),
[hegumens](hegumen "wikilink"),
[archimandrites](archimandrite "wikilink"), and other monastics in
processions and while attending various church services, such as
[Vespers](Vespers "wikilink") or [Matins](Matins "wikilink"); but not
when vested to celebrate the [Divine
Liturgy](Divine_Liturgy "wikilink"). Unlike the Western
[cope](cope "wikilink"), the mantle is worn only by monastics. The
[klobuk](klobuk "wikilink") is worn over the mantle.

Christian knights, many of whom take monastic vows, wear a mantle as
well, often containing [Christian
symbols](Christian_symbol "wikilink").[1] Knights of the Equestrian
Order of the Holy Sepulchre, for example, wear a white mantle with a
[Jerusalem Cross](Jerusalem_Cross "wikilink") that represents the [Five
Holy Wounds of Christ](Five_Holy_Wounds "wikilink").[2]

## History

![](Antropov_Archbishop_Gavriil.jpg "fig:Antropov_Archbishop_Gavriil.jpg")
Gabriel (Petrov) wearing an episcopal mandyas (Alexey Andropov, 1774,
[State Russian Museum](State_Russian_Museum "wikilink"), [Saint
Petersburg](Saint_Petersburg "wikilink")).\]\]
![](Isidore_of_Pelusium_(Menologion_of_Basil_II).jpg "fig:Isidore_of_Pelusium_(Menologion_of_Basil_II).jpg"),
wearing a black mantle, from the Menologion of Basil II, 11th
Century.\]\]

The mantle was originally a cape worn simply to ward off the cold. The
mantle was first mentioned in the [Old
Testament](Old_Testament "wikilink"), as a garment worn by several
prophets including [Elijah](Elijah "wikilink") and
[Elisha](Elisha "wikilink"). In , the mantle passing from Elijah the
prophet, to Elisha, his successor, symbolizes the passing of prophetic
authority:


And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold,
there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them
both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.

And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of
Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took
hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.

He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back,
and stood by the bank of Jordan;

And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the
waters, and said, Where is the God of Elijah? and when he also had
smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went
over.

Depictions of monks on [icons](icon "wikilink") show the mantle in use
from the earliest Christian times. The original monastic mantle was of
simple material: black, brown or grey, depending on what was at hand. As
time went on, the use of mantles of a particular color and style came to
be established as specific monastic vesture. Over the years
distinguishing colors and ornamentation came to be applied to the mantle
to distinguish monastics of higher positions within the church, while
still reminding them of the need for monastic humility.

In the contemporary practice of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Monks &
Nuns wear solid black mantles. They also wear veils, differing between
traditions and rank. In common practice, monks wear a black veil that
covers a [Kalimavkion](Kalimavkion "wikilink"), a cylindrical hat.
Abbesses also wear this same veil and hat while nuns only wear the veil.
The practice of wearing a kalimavkion below the veil has only arisen in
the last 300 years, and prior to this period, monks either wore no veil,
or wore a pointed veil, as seen in many Russians of the old rite and
icons of African saints. Nuns have been wearing a veil, in addition to
the mantle since at least the 11th Century.

## Monastics

![](Sergius_of_Radonezh_vita_icon_(17_c.,_Yaroslavl_museum)_2.jpg "fig:Sergius_of_Radonezh_vita_icon_(17_c.,_Yaroslavl_museum)_2.jpg")
of Saint [Sergius of Radonezh](Sergius_of_Radonezh "wikilink") wearing
the black monastic mantle.\]\]

The monastic mantle is worn by Orthodox Christian
[monks](monk "wikilink") and
[nuns](Nun#Eastern_Orthodox_Christian "wikilink") of the [Lesser
Schema](Degrees_of_Eastern_Orthodox_monasticism#Stavrophore "wikilink")
and [Great
Schema](Degrees_of_Eastern_Orthodox_monasticism#Great_Schema "wikilink").
In the Greek practice the use of the mantle by those of the Lesser
Schema is less common. (It is not worn by
[Rassaphores](Degrees_of_Eastern_Orthodox_monasticism#Rassaphore "wikilink")).
The mantle worn by a simple monk or nun is black (black being the
traditional monastic color, symbolizing mourning over one's sins and a
reminder of the [vow of poverty](vow_of_poverty "wikilink")), joined at
the neck and hanging down to the feet. In the Russian tradition, the
mantle is usually pleated (33 pleats for the number of years in the
earthly life of [Jesus](Jesus "wikilink")). It may or may not have a
train. Over the centuries, much symbolic meaning has come to be
attributed to the mantle:

"\[The\] mantle is a monastic vestment, which covers the whole person
with the exception of the head. Its freely flowing lines typify the
wings of the Angels; hence it is called "the Angelic vestment." The
folds of the Mantle are symbolical of the all-embracing power of God;
and also of the strictness, piety and meekness of the monastic life; and
that the hands and other members of a monk do not live, and are not
fitted for worldly activity, but are all dead."[3]

"\[The mantle\] is called 'the garment of incorruption and purity' \[in
the text of the [Tonsure](Tonsure "wikilink") ceremony\], and the
absence of sleeves is to remind the monk that he is debarred from
worldly pursuits. The mantle is given him in token of the 'exalted
angelic state' which he assumes"[4]

The mantle is bestowed upon a monk when he becomes as Stavrophore
(Lesser Schema), for which reason this rank of monk is sometimes
referred to as a "mantle monk". The mantle is bestowed a second time if
he becomes a Schemamonk (Greater Schema).

An [Hegumen](Hegumen "wikilink") (Abbot) or
[Hegumenia](Hegumenia "wikilink") (Abbess) wears the simple monastic
mantle.

When an Orthodox monk or nun dies, they are vested in their [religious
habit](religious_habit "wikilink"). A strip of cloth is torn from the
bottom of their mantle and is used to bind their body three times:
around the chest, around the waist, and around the feet.

## Archimandrites

The mantle worn by an archimandrite will be joined in front at the
bottom as well as at the neck, and will have "tablets" or "pectorals"
(Greek: πόματα, *pómata*; Slavonic: *skrizhali*)—rectangular pieces of
red or green cloth sewn onto the corners of the mantle (i.e., two at the
neck and two at the feet). The upper two tablets (those at the neck)
will often be [embroidered](embroidery "wikilink") with
[crosses](Christian_cross "wikilink"). The tablets symbolize the fact
that the Archimandrite will guide the brethren according to the
commandments of God. The four tablets being symbolic of the Old and the
[New Testaments](New_Testament "wikilink"), and of the Four Gospels.

When an archimandrite dies, his mantle is laid on his coffin in place of
a [funeral pall](Pall_(funeral) "wikilink").

## Bishops

There is also an episcopal mantle which is not worn with the other
episcopal [vestments](Vestment#Eastern_Church_vestments "wikilink")
while celebrating the [Divine Liturgy](Divine_Liturgy "wikilink"), but
when the bishop formally enters the church beforehand, or when a bishop
is formally attending (i.e., presiding over) a service in which he is
not serving. Among the Greeks, it is common for all bishops regardless
of rank, to wear a red mantle; however, many also use purple during
[Great Lent](Great_Lent "wikilink"). In the Slavic tradition, a more
complex color scheme has developed, and hierarchs wear different-colored
mantles according to their rank: violet for bishops; plum for
[archbishops](archbishop "wikilink"); blue for
[metropolitans](metropolitan_bishop "wikilink"); and green for
[patriarchs](patriarch "wikilink") in the Russian tradition. Different
national churches have different traditions regarding the colors worn by
bishops.

In the Russian tradition, the episcopal mantiya is characteristically
decorated with red and white horizontal ribbons, called "rivers" or
"streams" (Greek: ποταμοί, *potamoí*; Slavonic: *Istochniki*),
symbolizing the word of God going out into the entire world (, , ).
Among the Greeks, these rivers are usually gold.

The tablets on the Bishop's mantle may be more finely embroidered or
made of more costly material than those on the mantle of an
archimandrite. The upper tablets (those at the neck) may be embroidered
with icons; those at the feet may be embroidered with the bishop's
monogram. The episcopal tablets symbolise the four
[Gospels](Gospel "wikilink") which must be the focus of a bishop's
teachings. The episcopal mantle always has a train on it,[5] and may
have small bells attached as well, recalling the bells attached to the
Robe of the [High Priest](Kohen_Gadol "wikilink") ().

In general, when a bishop celebrates any service other than the Divine
Liturgy (or when he is attending, but not celebrating Liturgy), he will
wear the mantle with the [Epitrachelion](Epitrachelion "wikilink"), the
[Omophorion](Omophorion "wikilink") (the latter being worn outside the
mantle), and, in some liturgical traditions, the
[Cuffs](Epimanikia "wikilink"). He will also stand on an
[Orlets](Orlets "wikilink").

When a bishop dies, his mantle is laid on his coffin in place of a
[funeral pall](Pall_(funeral) "wikilink").

## Knights

![](Grabesritter5.jpg "fig:Grabesritter5.jpg"), which represent the
[Five Holy Wounds of Christ](Five_Holy_Wounds "wikilink").[6]\]\]
Christian knights who are members of [military
orders](Military_order_(religious_society) "wikilink"), such as the
[Order of Saint
John](Alliance_of_the_Orders_of_Saint_John_of_Jerusalem "wikilink") and
[Equestrian Order of the Holy
Sepulchre](Equestrian_Order_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre "wikilink"), wear a
mantle.[7]
