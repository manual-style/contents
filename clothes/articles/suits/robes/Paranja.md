![](Uzbek_paranja2.jpg "fig:Uzbek_paranja2.jpg") **Paranja** or
**paranji** (from فرنجية паранджа)[1] is a traditional [Central
Asian](Central_Asian "wikilink") [robe](robe "wikilink") for women and
girls that covers the head and body.[2][3] It is also known as the
"[burqa](burqa "wikilink")" in other languages. It is similar in basic
style and function to other regional styles such as the Afghan chadari.
The chasmband and paranja were used by women to completely cover
themselves in cities in Central Asia.[4]

In sedentary Central Asian Muslim areas (today
[Uzbekistan](Uzbekistan "wikilink") and
[Tajikistan](Tajikistan "wikilink")), women wore veils which shrouded
the entire face. These were called paranja[5] or faranji. The
traditional veil in Central Asia worn before modern times was the
faranji.[6] The part that covered the face, known as the **chachvan**
(or **chachvon**), was heavy in weight and made from horsehair. It was
especially prevalent among urban [Uzbeks](Uzbeks "wikilink") and
[Tajiks](Tājik_people "wikilink"). The paranja was worn in
[Khorezm](Khwarezm "wikilink").[7][8] It was also worn during the
[Shaybanids](Shaybanids "wikilink")' rule (1510–1600).[9]

In the 1800s, women of the Tajiks and Uzbek Muslims were obliged to wear
paranja when outside the home.[10] Paranji and chachvon were by 1917
common among urban Uzbek women of the southern river basins. This was
less frequently worn in the rural areas, and scarcely at all on the
nomadic steppe.[11]

One historical account of the paranja is from Lord Curzon, who travelled
to [Bukhara](Bukhara "wikilink") in 1886.[12] During his time there he
never saw a woman between the ages of 10 and 50, for they were all
concealed. The heavy black horsehair veils were "too bad and coarse for
a seive", the women walking in loosely wrapped blue gowns with the empty
sleeves pinned could have been "mistaken for clothes wandering about",
and big leather boots covered their feet.[13][14][15][16][17] Curzon
noted that "Ladies of rank and good character never venture to show
themselves in any public place or bazaar." He condemned this as a kind
of tyranny, an exaggerated and erroneous notion of morality found
everywhere in the East, but nowhere so striking as in Bukhara.[18][19]

[Russia](Russia "wikilink")'s [October
Revolution](October_Revolution "wikilink"), which brought about [state
atheism](state_atheism "wikilink"), sought to discourage or ban the
[veil](veil "wikilink") and the paranja.[20][21] The unveiling by the
Soviets was called the "hujum" in the [Uzbek Soviet Socialist
Republic](Uzbek_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "wikilink") (SSR).[22] As the
Soviet Communists secured their control of Central Asia, chachvans and
paranjas were banned.[23][24] The paranjas were burned on orders of the
Communists, who upheld the doctrine of [Marxist-Leninist
atheism](Marxist-Leninist_atheism "wikilink").[25] In the 1920s, the
government "brought gangs of [militant young
atheists](League_of_Militant_Atheists "wikilink") to [Central
Asia](Central_Asia "wikilink") who physically
[assaulted](assault "wikilink") women, often tearing the veil from their
faces in the streets of Tashkent, Samarkand, and other cities."[26]
However, some veil-wearing Muslim women responded by killing the women
who were sent to take their veils off.[27] Some Uzbeks violently opposed
the anti-paranja, anti-child marriage and anti-polygamy campaign which
was started by the Soviet Union.[28]

Since the [dissolution of the Soviet
Union](dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "wikilink"), Tajikistan President
Emomali has claimed that veils were not part of Tajik culture.[29] The
veil was attacked by the government of Kyrgyz President [Almazbek
Atambayev](Almazbek_Atambayev "wikilink").[30][31][32] They are seldom
worn now in Central Asia. __NOTOC__
