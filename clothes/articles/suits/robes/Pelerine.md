**pelerine** is a small [cape](cape "wikilink") that covers the
shoulders.[1] It was most popular during the mid- to late nineteenth
century in Europe and the Americas.[2]

The word comes from the French "p√®lerine" (pilgrim) and is perhaps a
reference to the small capes worn by many of the women in [Jean-Antoine
Watteau's](Jean-Antoine_Watteau "wikilink") 1717 painting *[Pilgrimage
to Cythera](The_Embarkation_for_Cythera "wikilink")*.[3]

Pelerines could be made of various materials, including muslin and silk.
They could be adorned with embroidery, beadwork, ruffles,[4] or
even[featherwork](featherwork "wikilink").[5]
[Crocheted](Crochet "wikilink") pelerines were also common.[6]

Layered muslin pelerines were popular in the
[1830s](1830s_in_Western_fashion "wikilink") as an option to drape over
the top of the large sleeves fashionable at that period.[7] Along with
[tippets](tippet "wikilink"), they helped emphasise the fashionable
width of the sleeves and the shoulderline of the decade.[8]

By the late nineteenth century, pelerines tended to be seen as less
formal garments and were often worn at home.[9][10]
