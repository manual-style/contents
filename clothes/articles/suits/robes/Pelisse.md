in [hussar](hussar "wikilink") uniform with a military pelisse slung
over the shoulder, 1812, by [Thomas
Lawrence](Thomas_Lawrence "wikilink")\]\]

A **pelisse** was originally a short fur trimmed jacket that was usually
worn hanging loose over the left shoulder of [hussar](hussar "wikilink")
light cavalry soldiers, ostensibly to prevent sword cuts. The name was
also applied to a fashionable style of woman's coat worn in the early
19th century.

## Military uniform

The style of uniform incorporating the pelisse originated with the
hussar mercenaries of Hungary in the 17th Century. As this type of light
cavalry unit became popular in Western Europe, so too did their dress.
In the 19th century pelisses were in use throughout most armies in
Europe, and even some in North and South America.

Hussar with the characteristic loose-hanging pelisse over-jacket\]\] In
appearance the pelisse was characteristically a very short and extremely
tight fitting (when worn) jacket, the cuffs and collar of which were
trimmed with fur. The jacket was further decorated with patterns sewn in
bullion lace, often in a pattern matching that of the
[dolman](dolman "wikilink") worn beneath it. The front of the jacket was
distinctive and typically featured several rows of parallel
[froggings](frog_(fastening) "wikilink") and loops, and either three or
five vertical lines of buttons. For officers of the British Hussars this
frogging, regimentally differentiated, was generally of gold or silver
bullion lace, to match either gold (gilt) or silver buttons. Other ranks
had either yellow lace with brass buttons or white lace with
'white-metal' (nickel) buttons. Lacing varied from unit to unit and
country to country. It was held in place by a
[lanyard](lanyard "wikilink"). In cold weather the pelisse could be worn
over the dolman.

The prevalence of this style began to wane towards the end of the 19th
Century, but it was still in use by some cavalry regiments in the
Imperial German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies up until [World War
I](World_War_I "wikilink"). In the Prussian Army the pelisse had been
abolished in 1853 but between 1865 and 1913 it was reintroduced for
ceremonial wear by nine hussar regiments and the Life-Guard Hussar
Regiment, usually at the request of the regimental Colonel-in-Chief.[1]
The two hussar regiments of the Spanish Army retained pelisses until
1931. The Danish
[Garderhusarregimentet](Guard_Hussar_Regiment_(Denmark) "wikilink") are
the only modern military unit to retain this distinctive item of dress,
as part of their mounted full-dress uniform.[2]

## Ladies fashion

In early 19th-century Europe, when military clothing was often used as
inspiration for fashionable ladies' garments, the term was applied to a
woman's long, fitted coat with set-in sleeves and the then-fashionable
[Empire waist](Empire_silhouette "wikilink"). Although initially these
[Regency](English_Regency "wikilink")-era pelisses copied the Hussars'
fur and braid, they soon lost these initial associations, and in fact
were often made entirely of [silk](silk "wikilink") and without fur at
all. They did, however, tend to retain traces of their military
inspiration with [frog](Frog_(fastening) "wikilink") fastenings and
braid trim. Pelisses lost even this superficial resemblance to their
origins as skirts and sleeves widened in the
[1830s](1830s_in_fashion "wikilink"), and the increasingly enormous
[crinolines](crinoline "wikilink") of the
[1840s](1840s_in_fashion "wikilink") and
['50s](1850s_in_fashion "wikilink") caused fashionable women to turn to
loose mantles, [cloaks](cloak "wikilink"), and
[shawls](shawl "wikilink") instead.
