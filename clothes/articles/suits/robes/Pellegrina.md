[cassock](cassock "wikilink") and pellegrina\]\]

The **pellegrina** is a [cape](cape "wikilink")-like item of clerical
dress worn by some [Catholic](Catholic_Church "wikilink")
[ecclesiastics](clergy "wikilink").

## Description

Similar to the [mozzetta](mozzetta "wikilink") but open in front, the
pellegrina is a short shoulder cape reaching to the elbow. It is made of
black or white material trimmed and lined with [amaranth
red](amaranth_(color) "wikilink") (for bishops) or [scarlet
red](scarlet_(color) "wikilink") (for
[cardinals](cardinalate "wikilink")). The [pope](pope "wikilink")'s
pellegrina is entirely white. In some countries, priests wear a
pellegrina of the same colour as their plain black cassock.

## Use

![](Papa_Benedetto_XVI_-_21_settembre_2005.jpg "fig:Papa_Benedetto_XVI_-_21_settembre_2005.jpg")
wearing a white pellegrina\]\] The general rule of the Roman Catholic
Church is that the pellegrina may be worn with the
[cassock](cassock "wikilink") by cardinals and bishops.[1]

In 1850, the year in which [Pope Pius IX](Pope_Pius_IX "wikilink")
[restored the Catholic hierarchy](Universalis_Ecclesiae "wikilink") in
England and Wales, he was understood to grant to all priests there the
privilege of wearing a replica in black of his own white cassock with
pellegrina.[2] Since then, the wearing of the pellegrina with the
cassock has been a sign of a Catholic priest in England and Wales,
Scotland, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.

![](Pallottines1.jpg "fig:Pallottines1.jpg") In his 1909 book, *Costume
of Prelates of the Catholic Church*, John Abel Felix Prosper Nainfa
[proposed](http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=nainfa+%22adopting+the+English+word+simar%22&btnG=Search+Books)
the use of the English word "[simar](simar "wikilink")", instead of the
word "cassock", for the garment with shoulder cape, which he treated as
distinct from the cassock proper. Others too have made the same
distinction between the "simar" (with pellegrina) and the "cassock"
(without), but many scholars disagree with Nainfa's distinction.[3] More
particularly, the documents of the [Holy See](Holy_See "wikilink") make
no such distinction, using the term "cassock" or "vestis talaris"
whether a pellegrina is attached or is not. Thus the 1969 Instruction
states that, for cardinals and bishops, "the elbow-length cape, trimmed
in the same manner as this *cassock*, may be worn over it".[4]
"Cassock", rather than "simar" is the term that is usually applied to
the dress of Popes and other Catholic ecclesiastics. The Instruction
also gives no support to Nainfa's claim that the cassock with shoulder
cape should not be worn in church services, which would be of difficult
application, since the cassock with pellegrina is generally made as a
single garment, with a non-detachable pellegrina.

When Pope Benedict XVI resigned in 2013, he decided that he would
continue to wear a white cassock but without pellegrina.[5][6]

## Origin of the name

The pellegrina owes its name to its similarity to a more ample shoulder
cape of cloth or leather that was traditionally worn by pilgrims
(*pellegrini* in [Italian](Italian_language "wikilink")).[7]
