[Quechua](Quechua_languages "wikilink");
[Mapudungun](Mapudungun "wikilink") *pontro*, blanket, woolen
fabric)[1][2][3] is an outer garment designed to keep the body warm. A
**rain poncho** is made from a watertight material designed to keep the
body dry from the [rain](rain "wikilink"). Ponchos have been used by the
[Native American](Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "wikilink") peoples
of the [Andes](Andes "wikilink") since
[pre-Hispanic](pre-Hispanic "wikilink") time, from places now under the
territory of [Bolivia](Bolivia "wikilink"), [Peru](Peru "wikilink"),
[Chile](Chile "wikilink") and [Ecuador](Ecuador "wikilink") and are now
considered typical [South American](South_America "wikilink") garments.

In late 18th century Basque navigator [José de
Moraleda](José_de_Moraleda_y_Montero "wikilink") wrote that the ponchos
of the [Huilliche](Huilliche_people "wikilink") of
[Osorno](Osorno,_Chile "wikilink") were as less pleasing ("vistosos")
than those of [Chiloé Archipelago](Chiloé_Archipelago "wikilink").[4]
The Huilliche are the principal indigenous population of Chile from
[Toltén River](Toltén_River "wikilink") to [Chiloé
Archipelago](Chiloé_Archipelago "wikilink").[5] [Mapuche
ponchos](Mapuche_textiles "wikilink") were once highly valued, in the
19th century a poncho could be traded for several horses or up to
seventy kilos of [yerba mate](yerba_mate "wikilink").[6] 19th century
Mapuche ponchos were clearly superior to non-indigenous Chilean textiles
and of good quality when comparing to contemporary European wool
textiles.[7]

## Types of ponchos

In its simplest form the poncho is essentially a single large sheet of
fabric with an opening in the center, for the head, and often it has an
extra piece of fabric serving as a hood. Rainproof ponchos normally are
fitted with fasteners to close the sides once the poncho is draped over
the body, with openings provided for the arms; many have hoods attached
to ward off wind and rain.

Alternative ponchos are now designed as fashion items.[8] They are the
same shape but of different material. They are designed to look
fashionable and provide warmth while remaining breathable and
comfortable, rather than to ward off wind and rain. These are often made
out of [wool](wool "wikilink") or [yarn](yarn "wikilink"),
[knitted](Knitting "wikilink") or [crocheted](crochet "wikilink").
Ponchos with festive designs or colors can be worn at special events as
well.

The poncho was one of the typical clothes of the
[Paracas](paracas_culture "wikilink"), Pre-Inca Peruvian Culture around
500 B.C., from which originate the earliest to have been discovered so
far.[9] Nowadays the poncho is commonly associated with the
[Americas](Americas "wikilink"). As traditional clothing, the local
names and variants are:

-   [Ruana](Ruana "wikilink"), in cold regions of
    [Colombia](Colombia "wikilink").
-   Poncho, most of Spanish-speaking countries and worldwide.
-   Pala or Poncho, in Portuguese-speaking Brazil (mainly in the South).
-   [Chamanto](Chamanto "wikilink"), only in [Central
    Chile](Central_Chile "wikilink"), poncho in the north and south.
-   [Jorongo](Jorongo "wikilink"), usually larger or full-length, and
    often used for special occasions or horse-back riding.
-   Gabán, typical in [Michoacán](Michoacán "wikilink"),
    [Mexico](Mexico "wikilink").
-   [Poncho chilote](Poncho_chilote "wikilink"), a heavy woolen poncho
    of [Chiloé Archipelago](Chiloé_Archipelago "wikilink").

### Military ponchos

The poncho was first used on a regular basis in the 1850s for irregular
U.S. military forces operating on the U.S. [Western
Plains](Great_Plains "wikilink").[10] These early military ponchos were
made of *[gutta percha](gutta_percha "wikilink")*
[muslin](muslin "wikilink"), a [latex](latex "wikilink")-coated,
waterproof cloth.[11] Ponchos made of gutta-percha or *[India
rubber](Natural_rubber "wikilink")* coated cloth were officially adopted
during the [American Civil War](American_Civil_War "wikilink"), both as
rain clothing and as a ground sheet for sleeping. While originally
intended for [cavalry](cavalry "wikilink") forces, they were widely used
by [infantry](infantry "wikilink") as well; [General
Sherman's](William_Tecumseh_Sherman "wikilink")
[Union](Union_(American_Civil_War) "wikilink") troops, lightly equipped
and living off [procurement demand](procurement_demand "wikilink") from
the local populace, wore ponchos during wet weather encountered during
the [march](Sherman's_March_to_the_Sea "wikilink") through
[Confederate](Confederate_States_of_America "wikilink")
[Georgia](Georgia_(U.S._state) "wikilink") to the sea.[12]

Discontinued after the Civil War, the [U.S.
Army](United_States_Army "wikilink") again issued ponchos of waterproof
rubberized canvas to its forces during the [Spanish–American
War](Spanish–American_War "wikilink") of 1898.[13] Two years later, both
the Army and the [Marines](United_States_Marine_Corps "wikilink") were
forced to issue waterproof rubberized cloth ponchos with high neck
collars during the [Philippine–American
War](Philippine–American_War "wikilink") in 1900.[14] With the entry of
the United States into [World War I](World_War_I "wikilink"), both
[doughboys](doughboy "wikilink") and
[Marines](United_States_Marine_Corps "wikilink") in
[France](France "wikilink") wore the poncho; it was preferred over the
raincoat for its ability to keep both the wearer and his pack dry, as
well as serving as a roof for a makeshift shelter.[15]

Just prior to [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), ponchos were
significantly improved during testing with the U.S. Army Jungle
Experimental Platoon in the jungles of [Panama](Panama "wikilink"),
incorporating new, lighter materials and a drawcord hood that could be
closed off to form a rain fly or ground sheet.[16] Ponchos were widely
used by United States armed forces during World War II; even lightly
equipped foot-mounted forces such as [Merrill's
Marauders](Merrill's_Marauders "wikilink"), forced to discard tentage
and all other unnecessary equipment, retained their blanket and
poncho.[17] During the 1950s, new lightweight coated
[nylon](nylon "wikilink") and other synthetic materials were developed
for military ponchos. The poncho has remained in service ever since as a
standard piece of U.S. military field equipment.[18] Today, the [United
States armed forces](United_States_armed_forces "wikilink") issue
ponchos that may be used as a field expedient shelter. These garments
are also used by [hunters](hunter "wikilink"),
[campers](camping "wikilink"), and [rescue](rescue "wikilink") workers.

During World War II, the German Army ([Wehrmacht](Wehrmacht "wikilink"))
issued the *Zeltbahn* (see [Shelter half](Shelter_half "wikilink")), a
poncho that could be combined to form [tents](Poncho_tent "wikilink"). A
typical four-man tent used four *Zeltbahnen*.

## Film

-   [Clint Eastwood](Clint_Eastwood "wikilink") famously wore a poncho
    as the [lead character](Man_with_No_Name "wikilink") in each of the
    films he starred in for [Sergio Leone](Sergio_Leone "wikilink") (*[A
    Fistful of Dollars](A_Fistful_of_Dollars "wikilink")*, *[For a Few
    Dollars More](For_a_Few_Dollars_More "wikilink")* and *[The Good,
    the Bad and the Ugly](The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly "wikilink")*).
    This gave him a distinct look in comparison to other cowboy
    characters in films which usually preferred
    [dusters](Duster_(clothing) "wikilink").
