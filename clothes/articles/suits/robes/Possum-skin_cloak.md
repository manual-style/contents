origin (Melbourne Museum)\]\]

**Possum-skin cloaks** were a form of clothing worn by [Aboriginal
people](Indigenous_Australians "wikilink") in the south-east of
Australia – present-day [Victoria](Victoria,_Australia "wikilink") and
[New South Wales](New_South_Wales "wikilink").

The cloaks were made from numerous [possum](Phalangeriformes "wikilink")
[pelts](Fur "wikilink") sewn together with
[kangaroo](kangaroo "wikilink") [sinew](sinew "wikilink"), and often
decorated with significant incisions on the inside such as clan
insignias. They were rubbed with [ochre](ochre "wikilink") and fat to
both decorate and protect them.

As well as being a significant means of keeping warm in this often
chilly part of Australia, there was much importance around the making of
the cloaks and their wearing. They were handed down through generations
as [heirlooms](Antique "wikilink"). As with most Australian Aboriginal
belongings, there were many uses for the one thing – the cloaks were
also used as blankets, mattresses and to wrap babies.

## History

In 1827, Governor [Lachlan Macquarie](Lachlan_Macquarie "wikilink"),
after inspecting the recently forged road across the [Blue
Mountains](Blue_Mountains_(Australia) "wikilink") west of
[Sydney](Sydney "wikilink"), wrote about meeting some members of the
[Wiradjuri](Wiradjuri "wikilink") at the
[Bathurst](Bathurst,_New_South_Wales "wikilink") camp:

> They were all clothed with [Mantles](Mantle_(vesture) "wikilink") made
> of the skins of o'possums which were very neatly sewn together and the
> outside of the skins were carved in a remarkably neat manner. They
> appear to be very inoffensive and cleanly in their persons.[1]

The warm and weather-proof possum skin cloaks were also recognised and
appreciated by European settlers in the outback, where they became a
highly regarded personal item. Alexander Harris describes one as follows
from his personal knowledge in the early 1830s:

> ... the opossum \[of a large species\] trapped by the wandering
> shepherd for amusement, as he follows his flock along by the woodside,
> furnish the material for a blanket \[or cloak, to use the phrase of
> the country\] of the most luxurious, furry softness. Sixty-three \[9 x
> 7\] of these skins are the stated complement for one blanket or cloak;
> when made it is large enough doubled to envelope a tall man completely
> beyond head and feet. As a bed and blanket in one, there is, I
> suppose, nothing on earth that surpasses it, whilst as a protection
> against a day's rain it is as efficacious as a roof of a house.[2]

They are also reasonably common in accounts of the gold rush period of
the mid-19th century, but gradually became rarities, and restricted to
observations of Aboriginal people encountered on the margins of white
settlement.

## Decline in use

As Aboriginal people were dispossessed of their land, the making and
wearing of cloaks became rarer. In addition, white missionaries and
others were very efficient in the distribution of clothing and blankets
to Aboriginal communities which, over a few generations, caused the
tradition of possum skin cloak making to die out.

## Possum skin cloaks today

Two possum-skin cloaks are in [Museum
Victoria](Museum_Victoria "wikilink")'s collection. One, which dates
from 1853, is made from 83 possum skins. There are also cloaks at the
[National Museum of Australia](National_Museum_of_Australia "wikilink")
in [Canberra](Canberra "wikilink"), as well as four in overseas
collections.[3] The *Krowathunkooloong Keeping Place*, a museum of the
[Gunaikurnai](Gunaikurnai "wikilink") nation in
[Bairnsdale](Bairnsdale "wikilink") in regional Victoria, also has
possum skin cloaks on display; in the [Gunai
language](Gunai_language "wikilink") they were called *batha maruk*.[4]

book, *Wrapped in a Possum Skin Cloak*, by Amanda Reynolds, Debra
Couzens, Vicki Couzens, Lee Darroch and Treahna Hamm, tells the story of
some south-eastern Aboriginal people, two
[Gunditjmara](Gunditjmara "wikilink") women and two [Yorta
Yorta](Yorta_Yorta_people "wikilink") women, who set out in 1999 to
relearn the lost craft of possum-skin cloak-making.[5]
