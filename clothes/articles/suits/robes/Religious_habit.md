![](StAnthony.jpg "fig:StAnthony.jpg"), wearing the
[Coptic](Coptic_Orthodox_Church_of_Alexandria "wikilink") habit.\]\]

A **religious habit** is a distinctive set of [religious
clothing](religious_clothing "wikilink") worn by members of a [religious
order](religious_order "wikilink"). Traditionally some plain garb
recognisable as a religious habit has also been worn by those leading
the religious [eremitic](Hermit "wikilink") and
[anchoritic](Anchorite "wikilink") life, although in their case without
conformity to a particular uniform style.

In the typical [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "wikilink") or
[Anglican](Anglican "wikilink") orders, the habit consists of a
[tunic](tunic "wikilink") covered by a [scapular](scapular "wikilink")
and [cowl](cowl "wikilink"), with a hood for [monks](monk "wikilink") or
[friars](friar "wikilink") and a [veil](veil "wikilink") for
[nuns](nun "wikilink"); in other orders it may be a distinctive form of
[cassock](cassock "wikilink") for men, or a distinctive habit and veil
for women. Modern habits are sometimes eschewed in favor of a simple
business suit. Catholic [Canon Law](Canon_Law "wikilink") requires only
that it be in some way identifiable so that the person may serve as a
witness of [Gospel values](Evangelical_counsels "wikilink"). This
requires flexibility and creativity. For instance in Turkey, a
Franciscan might wear street clothes.

In many orders, the conclusion of [postulancy](postulant "wikilink") and
the beginning of the [novitiate](novitiate "wikilink") is marked by a
ceremony, during which the new novice is accepted then clothed in the
community's habit by the [superior](General_superior "wikilink"). In
some cases the novice's habit will be somewhat different from the
customary habit: for instance, in certain orders of women that use the
[veil](veil "wikilink"), it is common for novices to wear a white veil
while professed members wear black, or if the order generally wears
white, the novice wears a grey veil. Among some
[Franciscan](Franciscan "wikilink") communities of men, novices wear a
sort of overshirt over their tunic; [Carthusian](Carthusian "wikilink")
novices wear a black cloak over their white habit.

In some orders, different types or levels of profession are indicated by
differences in habits.

and [China](China "wikilink") wearing traditional kāṣāya.
[Bezeklik](Bezeklik "wikilink"), Eastern [Tarim

**Kāṣāya** ([Sanskrit](Sanskrit "wikilink"): काषाय kāṣāya;
[Pali](Pali "wikilink"): kasāva; ), "chougu"
([Tibetan](Standard_Tibetan "wikilink")) are the robes of
[Buddhist](Buddhism "wikilink") [monks](Bhikkhu "wikilink") and
[nuns](Bhikkhuni "wikilink"), named after a brown or saffron dye. In
Sanskrit and Pali, these robes are also given the more general term
*cīvara*, which references the robes without regard to color.

### Origin and construction

![](Gandhara_Buddha_(tnm).jpeg "fig:Gandhara_Buddha_(tnm).jpeg") wearing
kāṣāya robes, in the [Hellenistic](Hellenistic "wikilink") style.\]\]

Buddhist kāṣāya are said to have originated in [India](India "wikilink")
as set of robes for the devotees of [Gautama
Buddha](Gautama_Buddha "wikilink"). A notable variant has a pattern
reminiscent of an Asian rice field. Original kāṣāya were constructed of
discarded [fabric](textile "wikilink"). These were stitched together to
form three rectangular pieces of cloth, which were then fitted over the
body in a specific manner. The three main pieces of cloth are the
*antarvāsa*, the *uttarāsaṅga*, and the **.[1] Together they form the
"triple robe," or *tricīvara*. The tricīvara is described more fully in
the [Theravāda](Theravāda "wikilink") [Vinaya](Vinaya "wikilink") (Vin
1:94 289).

#### Uttarāsaṅga

A robe covering the upper body. It is worn over the undergarment, or
antarvāsa. In representations of the Buddha, the uttarāsaṅga rarely
appears as the uppermost garment, since it is often covered by the outer
robe, or saṃghāti.

#### Saṃghāti

The saṃghāti is an outer robe used for various occasions. It comes over
the upper robe (**), and the undergarment (*antarvāsa*). In
representations of the Buddha, the saṃghāti is usually the most visible
garment, with the undergarment or uttarāsaṅga protruding at the bottom.
It is quite similar in shape to the Greek
[himation](himation "wikilink"), and its shape and folds have been
treated in Greek style in the [Greco-Buddhist
art](Greco-Buddhist_art "wikilink") of [Gandhāra](Gandhāra "wikilink").

#### Additions

Other items that may have been worn with the triple robe were:

-   a waist cloth, the kushalaka
-   a buckled belt, the samakaksika

### Kāṣāya in Indian Buddhism

In India, variations of the kāṣāya robe distinguished different types of
monastics. These represented the different schools that they belonged
to, and their robes ranged widely from red and ochre, to blue and
black.[2]

Between 148 and 170 CE, the [Parthian](Parthia "wikilink") monk [An
Shigao](An_Shigao "wikilink") came to China and translated a work which
describes the color of monastic robes utilized in five major Indian
Buddhist sects, called *Dà Bǐqiū Sānqiān Wēiyí* (Ch. 大比丘三千威儀).[3]
Another text translated at a later date, the *Śariputraparipṛcchā*,
contains a very similar passage corroborating this information, but the
colors for the Sarvāstivāda and Dharmaguptaka sects are reversed.[4][5]

| Nikāya                                    | *Dà Bǐqiū Sānqiān Wēiyí* | *Śariputraparipṛcchā* |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| [Sarvāstivāda](Sarvastivada "wikilink")   | Deep Red                 | Black                 |
| [Dharmaguptaka](Dharmaguptaka "wikilink") | Black                    | Deep Red              |
| [Mahāsāṃghika](Mahasamghika "wikilink")   | Yellow                   | Yellow                |
| [Mahīśāsaka](Mahisasaka "wikilink")       | Blue                     | Blue                  |
| [Kaśyapīya](Kasyapiya "wikilink")         | Magnolia                 | Magnolia              |

In traditions of [Tibetan Buddhism](Tibetan_Buddhism "wikilink"), which
follow the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, red robes are regarded as
characteristic of the Mūlasarvāstivādins.[6]

According to Dudjom Rinpoche from the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, the
robes of fully ordained Mahāsāṃghika monastics were to be sewn out of
more than seven sections, but no more than twenty-three sections.[7] The
symbols sewn on the robes were the [endless
knot](endless_knot "wikilink") (Skt. *śrīvatsa*) and the conch shell
(Skt. *śaṅkha*), two of the [Eight Auspicious
Signs](Ashtamangala "wikilink") in Buddhism.[8]

### Jiāshā in Chinese Buddhism

In [Chinese Buddhism](Chinese_Buddhism "wikilink"), the kāṣāya is called
*gāsā* (Ch. 袈裟). During the early period of [Chinese
Buddhism](Chinese_Buddhism "wikilink"), the most common color was red.
Later, the color of the robes came to serve as a way to distinguish
monastics, just as they did in India. However, the colors of a Chinese
Buddhist monastic's robes often corresponded to their geographical
region rather than to any specific schools.[9] By the maturation of
Chinese Buddhism, only the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage was still in
use, and therefore the color of robes served no useful purpose as a
designation for sects, the way that it had in India.

### Kesa in Japanese Buddhism

![](JapaneseKesaofMabury.jpg "fig:JapaneseKesaofMabury.jpg") textile
collections.\]\]

In [Japanese Buddhism](Japanese_Buddhism "wikilink"), the kāṣāya is
called *kesa* (Jp. 袈裟). In Japan, during the
[Edo](Edo_period "wikilink") and [Meiji
periods](Meiji_period "wikilink"), kesa were even sometimes pieced
together from robes used in [Noh theatre](Noh_theatre "wikilink").

## Eastern Orthodoxy

![](megaloschema.svg "megaloschema.svg")

The [Eastern Orthodox Church](Eastern_Orthodox_Church "wikilink") does
not have distinct religious orders such as those in the Catholic Church.
The habit ([Greek](Greek_language "wikilink"): Σχήμα, *Schēma*) is
essentially the same throughout the world. The normal monastic color is
black, symbolic of repentance and simplicity. The habits of monks and
nuns are identical; additionally, nuns wear a scarf, called an
[apostolnik](apostolnik "wikilink"). The habit is bestowed in degrees,
as the monk or nun advances in the spiritual life. There are three
degrees: (1) the beginner, known as the **Rassaphore** ("robe bearer")
(2) the intermediate, known as the **Stavrophore** ("cross bearer"), and
(3) the **Great Schema** worn by Great Schema Monks or Nuns. Only the
last, the Schemamonk or Schemanun, the monastic of the highest degree,
wears the full habit.

The habit is formally bestowed upon monks and nuns at the ceremony known
as the [tonsure](tonsure "wikilink"). The parts of the Eastern Orthodox
habit are:

-   **Inner Rason** ([Greek](Greek_language "wikilink"): Έσώρασον,
    Ζωστικὸν or Ἀντερί, *Esórason*;
    [Slavonic](church_Slavonic "wikilink"): *Podryásnik*): The [inner
    rason](Cassock#Eastern_practice_.28Orthodox_and_Eastern_Catholic.29 "wikilink")
    (cassock) is the innermost garment. It is a long, collared garment
    coming to the feet, with narrow, tapered sleeves. Unlike the Roman
    cassock, it is double-breasted. The inner rason is the basic garment
    and is worn at all times, even when working. It is often given to
    [novices](novice "wikilink") and
    [seminarians](seminarian "wikilink"), though this differs from
    community to community. The inner rason is also worn by
    [chanters](chanter "wikilink"),
    [readers](Reader_(liturgy) "wikilink"), and the married clergy. For
    monks and nuns, it symbolizes the [vow](Religious_vows "wikilink")
    of [poverty](Poverty#Religious_poverty "wikilink").
-   **Belt** (Greek: Ζώνη, *Zone*; Slavonic: *Poyas*): The belt worn by
    Orthodox monks and nuns is normally leather, though sometimes it is
    of cloth. In the Russian tradition, married clergy, as well as the
    higher monastic clergy, may wear a cloth belt that is finely
    [embroidered](embroidery "wikilink"), especially on [feast
    days](Great_Feasts "wikilink"). The belt is symbolic of the vow of
    [chastity](chastity "wikilink").
-   **Paramand** (Greek: Παραμανδύας, *Paramandýas*; Slavonic:
    *Paraman*): The Paramand is a piece of cloth, approximately 5 inches
    square which is attached by ribbons to a wooden cross. The cloth is
    embroidered with a cross and the [Instruments of the
    Passion](Passion_(Christianity)#Instruments_of_the_Passion "wikilink").
    The wooden cross is worn over the chest, then the ribbons pass over
    and under the arms, like a [yoke](yoke "wikilink"), and hold the
    square cloth centered on the back. The paramand is symbolic of the
    yoke of Christ ().
-   **Outer Rason** (a.k.a. *riasa*, Greek: εξώρασον, *exorason* or
    simply ράσο, *raso*; Slavonic: *ryasa*): Among the Greeks it is worn
    by readers and all higher clerics; among the Russians it is worn
    only by monks, deacons, priests, and bishops.
-   **Analavos** (Greek: Άνάλαβος; Slavonic: *Analav*): The distinctive
    dress of the Great Schema is the analavos, and it is worn only by
    Schemamonks and Schemanuns. Traditionally made of either leather or
    wool, the analavos covers the shoulders, and then comes down in the
    front and back, forming a cross (see illustration, above right).
-   **Polystavrion** (Greek: Πολυσταύριον, lit. "many crosses"): The
    polystavrion is a long cord that has been plaited with numerous
    crosses forming a yoke that is worn over the analavos to hold it in
    place.
-   **Mantle** (Greek: Μανδύας, *Mandías*; Slavonic: *Mantíya*): The
    [Mantle](Mantle_(vesture) "wikilink") is a long, full cape, joined
    at the neck which the monastic wears over the other parts of the
    habit.

![](Tikhon_of_Moscow.jpg "fig:Tikhon_of_Moscow.jpg") wearing the
patriarchal white koukoulion\]\]

-   **Kalymafki** (a.k.a. *[Kalimavkion](Kalimavkion "wikilink")*,
    Greek: καλυμαύκι; Slavonic: klobuk): The distinctive
    [headdress](headdress "wikilink") of Eastern Orthodox monks and nuns
    is the kalymafki, a stiffened hat, something like a
    [fez](Fez_(clothing) "wikilink"), only black and with straight
    sides, covered with a [veil](veil "wikilink"). The veil has lappets
    which hang down on each side of the head and a stylized hood falling
    down the back. For monastics of the Great Schema, the kalymafki
    takes a very distinctive shape, known as a
    [koukoulion](Cowl "wikilink") (cowl), and is embroidered with the
    Instruments of the Passion. The koukoulion is also worn by the
    Patriarchs of several local churches, regardless of whether or not
    he has been tonsured to that degree. In the Slavic tradition, the
    koukoulion will be in the form of a cloth hood, similar to that worn
    on the Western cowl. Outside church, monastics wear a soft hat known
    as a [Skufia](Skufia "wikilink"). Again, for Schemamonks and
    Schemanuns it is embroidered with the Instruments of the Passion.

The portions of the habit worn by the various degrees of monastics is as
follows:

| Rasophore   | Stavrophore               | Great Schema |
|-------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Inner Rason | Inner Rason               | Inner Rason  |
| Belt        | Belt                      | Belt         |
|             | Paramand                  | Paramand     |
| Outer Rason | Outer Rason               | Outer Rason  |
|             |                           | Analavos     |
|             | Mantle (Russian use only) | Mantle       |
|             |                           | Polystavrion |
| Kalymafki   | Kalymafki                 | Koukoulion   |

## Hinduism

## Islam

## Jainism

Female ascetics and [Svetambara](Svetambara "wikilink") male monks
always wear un-stitched or minimally stitched white clothes.
[Digambara](Digambara "wikilink") Jain monks do not wear clothes. A loin
cloth which reaches up to the shins is called a Cholapattak. Another
cloth to cover the upper part of the body is called Pangarani (Uttariya
Vastra). A cloth that passes over the left shoulder and covers the body
up to a little above the ankle is called a Kïmli. Kïmli is a woolen
shawl. They also carry a woolen bed sheet and a woolen mat to sit on.
Those who wear clothes have a [muhapati](muhapati "wikilink"), which is
a square or rectangular piece of cloth of a prescribed measurement,
either in their hand or tied on their face covering the mouth.
Svetambara ascetics have an Ogho or Rajoharan (a broom of woolen
threads) to clean insects around their sitting place or while they are
walking. Digambara ascetics have a Morpichhi and a Kamandal in their
hands. This practice may vary among different sects of Jains but
essential principle remains the same to limit needs.

## Roman Catholicism

![](Sisters_(Daughters_of_Mary)_Roman_Catholic_Singing.jpg "Sisters_(Daughters_of_Mary)_Roman_Catholic_Singing.jpg")

[Pope John Paul II](Pope_John_Paul_II "wikilink") in his Post-Apostolic
Exhortation *Vita consecrata* (1996) says concerning the religious habit
of [consecrated](Consecrated_life "wikilink") persons:

> §25 … The Church must always seek to make her presence visible in
> everyday life, especially in contemporary culture, which is often very
> secularized and yet sensitive to the language of signs. In this regard
> the Church has a right to expect a significant contribution from
> consecrated persons, called as they are in every situation to bear
> clear witness that they belong to Christ.
> Since the habit is a sign of consecration, poverty and membership in a
> particular Religious family, I join the Fathers of the Synod in
> strongly recommending to men and women religious that they wear their
> proper habit, suitably adapted to the conditions of time and place.
> Where valid reasons of their apostolate call for it, Religious, in
> conformity with the norms of their Institute, may also dress in a
> simple and modest manner, with an appropriate symbol, in such a way
> that their consecration is recognizable.
> Institutes which from their origin or by provision of their
> Constitutions do not have a specific habit should ensure that the
> dress of their members corresponds in dignity and simplicity to the
> nature of their vocation.

### Nuns

wearing a white [cornette](cornette "wikilink") and habit in 1939\]\]
The religious habit of Roman Catholic nuns typically consists of the
following elements:

-   **Apron**: A variety of styles of aprons can be worn over the habit
    to protect it during work activities.
-   **Cincture**: The habit is often secured around the waist with a
    belt made of woven black wool.
-   **Card**: This stiff black covering is worn over the coif when the
    nun leaves the convent to prevent the coif from becoming wet or
    soiled.
-   **[Coif](Coif "wikilink")**: This is the garment's headpiece and
    includes the white cotton cap secured by a
    [bandeau](bandeau "wikilink") and a white
    [wimple](wimple "wikilink") or [guimpe](guimpe "wikilink") of
    starched linen, cotton, or (today) polyester to cover the cheeks and
    neck. It is sometimes covered by a thin layer of black
    [crêpe](Crêpe_(textile) "wikilink"). The
    [cornette](cornette "wikilink") was another type of coif.
-   **Tunic**: This is the central piece of the habit. It is a loose
    dress made of [serge](serge_(fabric) "wikilink") fabric pleated at
    the neck and draping to the ground. It can be worn pinned up in the
    front or in the back to allow the nun to work.
-   **[Scapular](Scapular "wikilink")**: This symbolic apron hangs from
    both front and back; it is worn over the tunic, and
    [Benedictine](Benedictine "wikilink") nuns also wear it over the
    belt, whereas some other orders wear it tied under the belt.
-   **Sleeves**: The habit contains two sets of sleeves, the larger of
    which can be worn folded up for work or folded down for ceremonial
    occasions or whenever entering a chapel.
-   **Underskirts**: The complete vestment includes two underskirts, a
    top skirt of black serge trimmed with cord and a bottom skirt of
    black cotton.
-   **[Veil](Black_veil "wikilink")**: This element is worn pinned over
    the coif head coverings and could be worn down to cover the face or
    up to expose it. The headpiece sometimes includes a white underveil
    as well.

Other accessories:

-   **Cross**: A cross of silver traditionally hangs from a black cord
    around the nun's neck.
-   **Ring**: Nuns who have taken final or "perpetual" vows indicate
    this status by wearing a simple silver ring on the left hand.
-   **[Rosary](Rosary "wikilink")**: The nun's rosary of wooden beads
    and metal links hangs from the belt by small hooks.
-   **Shoes**: Simple functional black shoes are the usual footwear.
-   **Suitcase**: Nuns often travel with a small black hand-held bag
    containing personal items and toiletries.

Different orders adhered to different styles of dress; these styles have
changed over time. In the 12th century the German abbess [Hildegard von
Bingen](Hildegard_von_Bingen "wikilink"), for example, advocated a style
for her nuns that included extravagant and lavish white silk habits worn
with golden head pieces designed to present the nun to Christ in her
most beautiful form.

### Priests

Usually, priests wear black or another dark color along with a white
clerical collar. A cassock is worn in more formal situations. White may
be worn in warmer climates. A priest is ceremonially given their habit,
and it symbolizes that they are a part of the church. Also, a ferraiolo
(a kind of cope) is worn along with the cassock on very formal
occasions, priests also traditionally wear a biretta on the head.

## Shinto

In Japan, various types of very traditional dress are worn by
[Shinto](Shinto "wikilink") priests, often dating to styles worn by
nobles during the [Nara period](Nara_period "wikilink") or [Heian
period](Heian_period "wikilink").

-   \- a type of traditional [Japanese
    clothing](Japanese_clothing "wikilink"), originally worn only by
    men, but today they are worn by both sexes. There are two types,
    divided and undivided . The *umanori* type have divided legs,
    similar to [trousers](trousers "wikilink"), but both types appear
    similar. *Hakama* are tied at the waist and fall approximately to
    the ankles, and are worn over a [kimono](kimono "wikilink")
    (hakamashita), with the kimono then appearing like a shirt.

-   is a garment worn in Japan by people attending religious ceremonies
    and activities, including Buddhist and Shinto related occasions. Not
    only [Shinto](Shinto "wikilink") and Buddhist priests can be found
    wearing Jōe at rituals, but laymen as well, for example when
    participating in pilgrimage such as the [Shikoku
    Pilgrimage](Shikoku_Pilgrimage "wikilink"). The garment is usually
    white or yellow and is made of linen or silk depending on its kind
    and use. The Shinto priest who wears the *jōe* is attired in a
    peaked [cap](cap "wikilink") called *tate-eboshi*, an outer tunic
    called the *jōe* proper, an outer robe called *jōe no sodegukuri no
    o*, an undergarment called *hitoe*, ballooning trousers called
    *sashinuki* or *nubakama*, and a girdle called *jōe no ate-obi*.
