A **robe** is a loose-fitting outer
[garment](clothing "wikilink").[1][2] Unlike garments described as
[capes](cape "wikilink") or [cloaks](cloak "wikilink"), robes usually
have [sleeves](sleeve "wikilink"). The
[English](English_language "wikilink") word *robe* derives from [Middle
English](Middle_English "wikilink") *robe* ("garment"),
[borrowed](loanword "wikilink") from [Old French](Old_French "wikilink")
*robe* ("booty, spoils"), itself taken from the
[Frankish](Old_Frankish "wikilink") word \**rouba* ("spoils, things
stolen, clothes"), and is related to the word *rob*.[3]
