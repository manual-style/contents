A **ruana** (possibly from [Spanish](Spanish_language "wikilink")
*ruana* "ragged" or [Quechua](Quechuan_languages "wikilink") *ruana*
"textile"[1]) is a [poncho](poncho "wikilink")-style outer garment
typical of the [Andes](Andes "wikilink") region of
[Colombia](Colombia "wikilink"), particularly in the [Boyacá
department](Boyacá_department "wikilink") and
[Antioquia](Antioquia_Department "wikilink").

Similar to other poncho-like garments in [Latin
America](Latin_America "wikilink"), a ruana is basically a very thick,
soft and sleeveless square or rectangular blanket with an opening in the
center for the head to go through with a slit down the front to the hem.
A ruana may or may not come with a hood to cover the head.

## Etymology and Origin

The word ruana is of unknown origin but likely comes from the [Spanish
language](Spanish_language "wikilink") "*ruana*" meaning woolen cloth,
ragged, or street-related. However, albeit dubious, according to
[ProColombia](ProColombia "wikilink") (former Proexport), the official
Colombian agency in charge of international tourism, foreign investment,
and non-traditional exports, the word ruana comes from the
[Chibcha](Chibcha_language "wikilink") *ruana* meaning "Land of
Blankets", used to refer to the woolen fabrics manufactured by the
[Muisca](Muisca_people "wikilink") natives.[2]

The ruanas worn by the native [Muisca](Muisca_people "wikilink")
(Chibcha) were apparently made of wool and knee-long, well-suited to the
cold temperatures of the region where they were used not only as a piece
of garment but also as a blanket for use in bed or to sit on as a
cushion of sorts. Many ruanas are handcrafted with sheep's virgin wool.
An 1856 watercolor shows an indigenous man in the [Cordillera
Occidental](Cordillera_Occidental_(Colombia) "wikilink") of Colombia
weaving a ruana using a large foot-pedaled [loom](loom "wikilink").[3]

Nevertheless, the pre-Columbian local origin hypothesis of the ruana is
widely unacknowledged among Colombian scholars, noting that although
pre-Columbian Muisca (also known as Chibcha) peoples wore garments
similar to the ruana, the modern ruana doesn't seem to have evolved from
these nor it shows continuity from the regional pre-hispanic
garments,[4] rather the ruana appears to have been introduced after the
Spanish conquest by the uprooted foreign
[Quechua](Quechua_people "wikilink") [yanakuna](yanakuna "wikilink")[5]
slave-servants belonging to the defunct Inca Empire who were brought by
the local Spanish hacendados in order to work the lands during the early
Colonial period.
