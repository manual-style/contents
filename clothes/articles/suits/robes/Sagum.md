The **sagum** was a garment of note generally worn by members of the
[Roman military](Military_of_ancient_Rome "wikilink") during both the
[Republic](Roman_Republic "wikilink") and early
[Empire](Roman_Empire "wikilink"). Regarded symbolically as a garment of
war by the same tradition which embraced the [toga](toga "wikilink") as
a garment of peace,[1] it was slightly more practical in any event,
consisting of a simple rectangular segment of cloth fastened by a
leather or perhaps metal clasp and worn on top of the armor. The fabric
was made of unwashed wool, saturated with [lanolin](lanolin "wikilink")
(which made it water-resistant); it was traditionally dyed bright red.
