**Sarashi** is Japanese for "bleached cloth", usually
[cotton](cotton "wikilink"), or less commonly
[linen](linen "wikilink").[1][2][3][4][5]

Such cloth may be wrapped around the body under a
[kimono](kimono "wikilink"), or around the chest. Sometimes it is
wrapped round below the belly during pregnancy, or around the waist
after the birth of a child. It is used by men and women. The whiteness
and purity of the cloth has ritual significance, therefore it may also
be used in rituals.
