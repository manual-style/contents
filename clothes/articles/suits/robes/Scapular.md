[monks](monk "wikilink") in their [habit](Religious_habit "wikilink")
(with hoodless black monastic scapular)\]\] The **scapular** (from Latin
*[scapulae](wikt:scapula#Latin "wikilink")*, "shoulders") is a [Western
Christian](Western_Christianity "wikilink") garment suspended from the
shoulders. There are two types of scapular, the
[monastic](Monasticism "wikilink") and
[devotional](Catholic_devotions "wikilink") scapular, although both
forms may simply be referred to as "scapular".[1][2] As an object of
popular piety, it serves to remind the wearers of their commitment to
live a Christian life.

The "monastic scapular" appeared first, perhaps as early as the 7th
century in the [Order of Saint
Benedict](Order_of_Saint_Benedict "wikilink").[3] It is a somewhat large
length of cloth suspended both front and back from the shoulders of the
wearer, often reaching to the knees. It may vary in shape, color, size
and style. Monastic scapulars originated as aprons worn by medieval
monks, and were later extended to habits for members of religious
organizations, orders or confraternities. Monastic scapulars now form
part of the [habit](religious_habit "wikilink") of
[monks](monk "wikilink") and [nuns](nun "wikilink") in many [Christian
orders](religious_orders "wikilink").[4][5]

The "devotional scapular" is a much smaller item and evolved from the
monastic scapular. These may also be worn by individuals who are not
members of a monastic order. The devotional scapular typically consists
of two small (usually rectangular) pieces of cloth, wood or laminated
paper, a few inches in size, which may bear religious images or text.
These are joined by two bands of cloth and the wearer places one square
on the chest, rests the bands one on each shoulder and lets the second
square drop down the back.[6][7]

In many cases, both forms of the scapular come with a set of promises
for the faithful who wear them. Some of the promises are rooted in
tradition, and others have been formally approved by religious leaders.
For Roman Catholics, for instance, over the centuries several popes have
approved specific [indulgences](indulgence "wikilink") for scapulars, as
for some other objects of popular piety.[8][9]

## History

![](Anthony_Abbot_by_Zurbaran.jpeg "fig:Anthony_Abbot_by_Zurbaran.jpeg")
[Antony of Egypt](Antony_of_Egypt "wikilink") depicted wearing a brown
monastic scapular and cloak\]\]

The scapular may have emerged from an apron-like piece of cloth worn by
monks. Item 55 of the [Rule of Saint
Benedict](Rule_of_Saint_Benedict "wikilink"), dating to the 7th century
refers to the use of the scapular.[10][11][12][13][14] In the Catholic
Church the key elements of a monk's habit eventually became the tunic,
the [cincture](cincture "wikilink"), the scapular and the hood. A nun's
clothing included the tunic, the scapular and the head veil.[15] Some
authors interpret the scapular as a symbolic apron based on the fact
that monks and nuns, when engaged on some manual labor, tend to cover it
with a protective apron or carefully tuck it up or throw the front
length back over their shoulder to prevent it from getting in the
way.[16]

## Varieties

### Monastic scapular

![](San_Hugo_en_el_Refectorio.jpg "fig:San_Hugo_en_el_Refectorio.jpg")
in white hooded scapulars, by [Francisco de
Zurbarán](Francisco_de_Zurbarán "wikilink"), 1630–1635\]\] Today, the
monastic scapular is part of the garb, the
[habit](Religious_habit "wikilink"), of many Christian [religious
orders](religious_order "wikilink"), of both [monks](monk "wikilink")
and [nuns](nun "wikilink"). It is an outer garment about the width of
the chest, from shoulder to shoulder. It hangs down in the front and
back almost to the feet, but is open on the sides (it was originally
joined by straps at the waist). It is related to the *analavos* worn in
the [Eastern
tradition](Degrees_of_Eastern_Orthodox_monasticism "wikilink").

Historically, the monastic scapular was at times referred to as *scutum*
(i.e. shield), as it was laid over the head, which it originally covered
and protected with one portion (from which the hood afterwards
developed).[17] A specific aspect of the use of the monastic scapular
from its earliest days was obedience and the term *jugum Christi*, i.e.
"yoke of Christ", was used to refer to it. The term "yoke of Christ"
signified obedience and removing a scapular was like removing the
[yoke](yoke "wikilink") of Christ, i.e. rebelling against authority. For
instance, the Carmelite constitution of 1281 prescribed that the
scapular should be worn to bed under penalty of serious fault, and the
constitution of 1369 included automatic excommunication for a Carmelite
saying Mass without a scapular.[18][19][20]
![](Carmelitas_de_la_comunidad_de_Nogoyá.jpg "fig:Carmelitas_de_la_comunidad_de_Nogoyá.jpg")
Over the centuries the religious orders adapted the basic scapular as
they considered appropriate for themselves, as a result of which there
are now several distinct designs, colors, shapes and lengths in use. The
[Carthusians](Carthusians "wikilink") and others attached a hood to
their scapular, rather than keeping the former a separate item of their
habit, while some, like the [Dominican
Order](Dominican_Order "wikilink") or
[Carmelites](Carmelites "wikilink"), wear it beneath another layer, like
a shoulder cape or capuce (that is, the "hood"). The color selection
could change over time; for instance, prior to 1255, the
[Augustinian](Augustinian "wikilink") scapulars for novices were black
and those of the lay brethren were white, but thereafter all scapulars
but those of the lay brethren had to be white.[21]

In some cases the monastic scapular was used to distinguish the rank or
level of the wearer within a religious order. For instance, in some
[Byzantine](Byzantine "wikilink") monastic practices, two levels of
fully professed monk or nun exist: those of the "little habit" and those
other of the "great habit", these being more senior and not having to do
manual labor. In these cases, the "great habit" was simply distinguished
from the "little habit" by the addition of a scapular decorated with the
[instruments of the Passion](instruments_of_the_Passion "wikilink").[22]

Just as the stole is the vestment that came to mark the office of a
[priest](priest "wikilink"), the monastic scapular became the equivalent
for those in the monastic life and even today, a long scapular
identifies its wearer as a member of a religious order. It is a symbol
of the confraternal way, combining in itself the principle of *ora et
labora* (prayer and work), and so the form was later adopted by pious
laity who wished to have an open sign of their devotion.

### Non-monastic reduced scapular

Some authors suggest that the tradition of wearing a reduced form of a
non-monastic scapular started in the 11th century with [Saint Peter
Damian](Saint_Peter_Damian "wikilink") and the monastic scapular was
gradually transformed from an item of clothing that was part of the
habit of monks and nuns to a smaller item that expressed devotion by
individuals, called [oblates](oblate "wikilink"), who lived in the
world, but wished to be affiliated with a monastery.[23]

In the [Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink"), it became common for
Christian faithful to share in the
[spirituality](spirituality "wikilink") of the new [mendicant
orders](mendicant_orders "wikilink") in an auxiliary sense, sometimes
called [Third Orders](Third_Orders "wikilink") because they were founded
after the initial orders of the friars and nuns. Although these people
(called [Tertiaries](Third_order "wikilink")) were permitted to wear the
"tertiary habit", because they had not taken [religious
vows](religious_vows "wikilink") they were not usually permitted to wear
the full habit of the order. With time, it was considered a high honor
and great privilege to be granted a small cloth attached by bands which
would be worn over the torso in the same manner as the full monastic
scapular. [Confraternities](Confraternity "wikilink") came to be formed
in which people would be granted the wearing of this item as a mark of
their sharing in the good works of a particular order.[24] Among
[Franciscans](Franciscans "wikilink"), they were known as *Cordbearers*,
due to their also wearing a small cord around the waist in imitation of
the one worn by the [friar](friar "wikilink").

After the disruptions of religious life during the period of the [French
Revolution](French_Revolution "wikilink") and the
[Napoleonic](Napoleon "wikilink") invasions of France and Italy, wearing
of the tertiary habit became prohibited. Thus it eventually became
common that a smaller form of an order's scapular would be bestowed upon
the non-monastic. Rather than a full length of cloth, it consisted of
two rectangles (several inches wide, and much larger than a modern
devotional scapular) of wool joined by bands in some fashion. These are
still worn today by the "Third Order" members of the
[Franciscans](Franciscans "wikilink"),
[Carmelites](Carmelites "wikilink"), and
[Dominicans](Dominican_Order "wikilink"). In order to gain the benefits
of the order, the members must wear these scapulae constantly. However,
in 1883 in his "*Constitution On the Law of the Franciscan Third Order*"
called *[Misericors Dei Filius](Misericors_Dei_Filius "wikilink")*,
[Pope Leo XIII](Pope_Leo_XIII "wikilink") declared that wearing either
these medium-sized scapulae of the "Third Order" or the miniature forms
of the smaller devotional scapular entitled the wearer equally to gain
the indulgences associated with the order.[25] Some religious orders
still give a short version (sometimes called the "reduced scapular", but
this usage is archaic) of their large scapular to non-monastics that are
spiritually affiliated with them. Such short scapulars are designed to
be unobtrusive and can be worn under regular clothing at home and at
work.

### Devotional scapular

![](Escapulariocafe.JPG "fig:Escapulariocafe.JPG") Devotional scapulars
are objects of popular piety, primarily worn by [Roman
Catholics](Roman_Catholic "wikilink"), as well as some
[Anglicans](Anglicans "wikilink") and [Lutherans](Lutheran "wikilink"),
designed to show the wearer's pledge to a confraternity, a saint, or a
way of life, as well as reminding the wearer of that promise.[26] Some
devotional scapulars bear images, or verses from scripture. Devotional
scapulars typically consist of two rectangular pieces of cloth, wool or
other fabric that are connected by bands. One rectangle hangs over the
chest of the wearer, while the other rests on the back, with the bands
running over the shoulders. Some scapulars have extra bands running
under the arms and connecting the rectangles to prevent them from
getting dislodged underneath the wearer's top layer of clothes.
![](Rosary&scapular.jpg "fig:Rosary&scapular.jpg") The roots of
devotional scapulars can be traced to the gathering of laity into
confraternities for spiritual direction, whereby the faithful would be
assigned some badge or token of affiliation and devotion. The image or
message on the scapular usually reflects the order's focus, tradition or
favored devotion.[27] Devotional scapulars and the indulgences attached
to them grew along with the growth of Catholic confraternities during
the 17th and 18th centuries. The fact that specific promises and
[indulgences](indulgence "wikilink") were attached to the wearing of
scapulars helped increase their following, as was seen with the early
example of the [Brown
Scapular](Scapular_of_Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel "wikilink"), habit of the
[Carmelites](Carmelite "wikilink").[28] This promise was based on the
[Carmelite](Carmelite "wikilink") tradition that the [Blessed Virgin
Mary](BVM(RC) "wikilink") appeared to [St. Simon
Stock](St._Simon_Stock "wikilink") at [Cambridge,
England](Cambridge,_England "wikilink") in 1251 in answer to his appeal
for help for his oppressed order and recommended the [Brown
Scapular](Scapular_of_Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel "wikilink") of the [Our
Lady of Mount Carmel](Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel "wikilink") to him and
promised salvation for the faithful who wore it piously.[29][30][31][32]
Regardless of the scholarly debates regarding the exact origin of the
[Brown Scapular](Scapular_of_Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel "wikilink"), it is
clear that it has been a part of the Carmelite habit since the late 13th
century. ![](Virgen_del_Carmen.JPG "fig:Virgen_del_Carmen.JPG") statue
in [Chile](Chile "wikilink") with a Brown Scapular, an example of the
use of the scapular in [Marian
art](Roman_Catholic_Marian_art "wikilink")\]\]

The [Blue Scapular of the Immaculate
Conception](Blue_Scapular_of_the_Immaculate_Conception "wikilink") that
dates to 1617 was eventually granted a significant number of
indulgences, and many graces were promised to those who would honor the
[Immaculate Conception](Immaculate_Conception "wikilink") by wearing the
Blue Scapular and live chastely according to their state in life. In
1885 [Pope Leo XIII](Pope_Leo_XIII "wikilink") approved the [Scapular of
the Holy Face](Scapular_of_the_Holy_Face "wikilink"), (also known as
*The Veronica*) and elevated the *Priests of the Holy Face* to an
[archconfraternity](archconfraternity "wikilink").[33] He also approved
the Scapular of [Our Lady of Good
Counsel](Our_Lady_of_Good_Counsel "wikilink") and the [Scapular of St.
Joseph](Scapular_of_St._Joseph "wikilink"), both in 1893, and the
[Scapular of the Sacred Heart](Scapular_of_the_Sacred_Heart "wikilink")
in 1900.[34] In 1611, the [Servite Order](Servite_Order "wikilink")'s
confraternity and their Black [Scapular of the Seven Sorrows of
Mary](Scapular_of_the_Seven_Sorrows_of_Mary "wikilink") received
indulgences from [Pope Paul V](Pope_Paul_V "wikilink").[35]

During the 19th century, a number of other Scapulars were approved. The
green Scapular of the [Immaculate Heart of
Mary](Immaculate_Heart_of_Mary "wikilink") was approved by [Pope Pius
IX](Pope_Pius_IX "wikilink") in 1877 and the white [Scapular of Our Lady
of Good Counsel](Scapular_of_Our_Lady_of_Good_Counsel "wikilink")
received the approval of [Leo XIII](Leo_XIII "wikilink") in 1893 for the
purpose of invoking Mary's guidance upon its wearer. The black Scapular
of Our Lady Help of the Sick, (for the Confraternity founded by [St.
Camillus de Lellis](St._Camillus_de_Lellis "wikilink")) was approved by
Pius IX in 1860. In 1863 he also approved the [Green
Scapular](Green_Scapular "wikilink"), which is not from a Confraternity
but an image inspired by a vision of the Blessed Mother experienced by
Sr. Justine Bisqueyburu from the [Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent
de Paul](Daughters_of_Charity_of_Saint_Vincent_de_Paul "wikilink").

By the early 20th century the devotional scapular had gained such a
strong following among Catholics worldwide that Joseph Hilgers, in the
[Catholic Encyclopedia](Catholic_Encyclopedia "wikilink") of 1912
stated: "Like the rosary, \[the Brown Scapular\] has become the badge of
the devout Catholic".[36] In the 1917 reported apparitions of [Our Lady
of Fátima](Our_Lady_of_Fátima "wikilink") the Virgin Mary is said to
have appeared "with a Rosary in one hand and a scapular in the other".
[Sister Lúcia](Lúcia_Santos "wikilink") (one of the three Fátima
children visionaries) stated that the Virgin Mary told her: "*The Rosary
and the Scapular are inseparable*".[37][38][39] In the United States
"Scapular Magazine" helped enroll one million Americans to pray the
Rosary based on the Fatima messages.[40] The Rosary and the devotional
scapular continue to be linked in the 21st century.[41]

While a number of scapulars (e.g. the [Scapular of the Holy
Face](Scapular_of_the_Holy_Face "wikilink"), also known as *The
Veronica*) are entirely Christocentric, the most widespread scapulars
(including the [Brown Scapular](Brown_Scapular "wikilink") of [Our Lady
of Mount Carmel](Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel "wikilink") and the [Blue
Scapular of the Immaculate
Conception](Blue_Scapular_of_the_Immaculate_Conception "wikilink"))
relate to [Marian devotions](Roman_Catholic_Mariology "wikilink") and
consecrations.[42] The official teachings of the Catholic Church
indicate that the Brown Scapular of Mount Carmel is one of the most
highly recommended Marian devotions. This has been the case through the
centuries, and more recently with popes including [Pius
XII](Pius_XII "wikilink"), [Paul VI](Paul_VI "wikilink") and [John Paul
II](John_Paul_II "wikilink"), who stated that he received his first
Brown Scapular of Mount Carmel at age ten when his Marian devotion was
taking shape and he continued to wear it into his papacy.[43]

The Catholic Encyclopedia lists 18 small scapulars approved by the Roman
Catholic church:[44]

1.  The White [Scapular of the Most Blessed
    Trinity](Trinitarian_Order "wikilink") (1193)
2.  The White [Scapular of Our Lady of
    Ransom](Scapular_of_Our_Lady_of_Ransom "wikilink") (1218)
3.  The Brown [Scapular of Our Lady of Mount
    Carmel](Scapular_of_Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel "wikilink") (1250)
4.  The Black [Scapular of the Seven Sorrows of
    Mary](Scapular_of_the_Seven_Sorrows_of_Mary "wikilink") (1255)
5.  The [Blue Scapular of the Immaculate
    Conception](Blue_Scapular_of_the_Immaculate_Conception "wikilink")
6.  The Red [Scapular of the Most Precious
    Blood](Scapular_of_the_Most_Precious_Blood "wikilink")
7.  The [Black Scapular of the
    Passion](Black_Scapular_of_the_Passion "wikilink") (1720)
8.  The [Red Scapular of the
    Passion](Red_Scapular_of_the_Passion "wikilink") (1846)
9.  The Black [Scapular of Help of the
    Sick](Scapular_of_Help_of_the_Sick "wikilink") (1860)
10. The White [Scapular of the Immaculate Heart of
    Mary](Scapular_of_the_Immaculate_Heart_of_Mary "wikilink") (1877)
11. The Blue and Black [Scapular of St. Michael the
    Archangel](Scapular_of_St._Michael_the_Archangel "wikilink") (1880)
12. The [Scapular of St.
    Benedict](Scapular_of_St._Benedict "wikilink") (1882)
13. The [Scapular of the Holy
    Face](Scapular_of_the_Holy_Face "wikilink") (1885)
14. The White [Scapular of the Our Lady of Good
    Counsel](Our_Lady_of_Good_Counsel#Scapular "wikilink") (1893)
15. The White [Scapular of St.
    Joseph](Scapular_of_St._Joseph "wikilink") (1898)
16. The White [Scapular of The Most Sacred Heart of
    Jesus](Scapular_of_the_Sacred_Heart "wikilink") (1900)
17. The [Scapular of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and
    Mary](Scapular_of_the_Sacred_Hearts_of_Jesus_and_Mary "wikilink") (1901)
18. The White [Scapular of St.
    Dominic](Scapular_of_St._Dominic "wikilink") (1903)

Of all the types recognized by the Roman Catholic Church the best-known,
and perhaps the most popular, is the [Scapular of Our Lady of Mount
Carmel](Scapular_of_Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel "wikilink"), sometimes
referred to as the [Brown Scapular](Brown_Scapular "wikilink") from the
color of its bands. The wearing of a devotional scapular has been viewed
as a *constant meditation* by Bishop Leo De Goesbriand: "Wherever I am,
whatever I am doing, Mary never sees me without seeing upon my body an
evidence of my devotion to her."[45] This scapular, with its history in
Britain, along with the [Scapular of Our Lady of
Walsingham](Scapular_of_Our_Lady_of_Walsingham "wikilink") are also
popular [devotions](Anglican_devotions "wikilink") in the [Anglican
Church](Anglican_Church "wikilink"). The [Green
Scapular](Green_Scapular "wikilink"), "instituted for the conversion of
those without faith" is another popular scapular among the Christian
community.[46]

From a spiritual viewpoint, Father Etienne Richer argues that devotional
scapular is one of key [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "wikilink")
devotions that *harmonize* with Catholic Liturgy in the meditative
process.[47]

### In Protestant churches

Scapular wearing is sometimes found in Protestant churches including
Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist. Instructions are provided in United
Methodist Church allowing scapular to be worn over the alb by anyone lay
or clergy, not as a pastoral stole or chasuble, either colored for the
Church season or not.[48]

Some Anglican churches use the scapular to designate the difference of
vestments between choristers boys and girls[49][50], a tradition that
continues in Church of South India for women and men[51].

Lutheran churches sometimes use scapulars as vestments for both men and
women servers[52] over cassocks which are regarded as clerical
clothing[53] not vestments. Scapulars in Protestant churches do not
necessarily have the same meaning as in Catholic church.

## Investment, blessing and rules

Though each scapular has its own particular qualifications and usage,
the Roman Catholic Church has set down certain rules that pertain to all
its types, be they monastic or devotional.

A scapular associated with a confraternity must be invested by an
ordained representative of that group. A scapular associated with a
mystery or devotion may simply be blessed by a priest and given to the
wearer. To receive the benefits or indulgences granted the scapular
generally must be worn constantly. It may be placed aside for a time
but, during that period, the wearer does not receive the scapular's
benefits. A wearer cannot confer benefits on a scapular already
equipped. Should the wearer take up the wearing of it again, the
benefits are again conferred.

A devotional scapular must be in good repair with both bands intact.
Multiple scapulae may be worn on the same bands, but the bands must be
the color of those prescribed by the scapular with the most preeminence,
and that scapular must be foremost with the others behind in order of
precedence. If a scapular becomes damaged to the point where it cannot
be in good repair, it must be replaced. However, it is not necessary for
the wearer to be reinvested as it is the devotion of the wearer, not the
object itself, that confers the benefit of the scapular.

55.4-6: "… in temperate regions for each monk a "hood(ed cloak)"(?

and footwear: socks (*pedules*, slip-shoes) and shoes …"
Timothy Fry, "RB 1980", p. 262, comments: "This word (*scapulare*) is
found in antiquity only here in RB and in *Vita patr. iuren.* 3.5, where
it appears as a summer garment. De Vogüé 6.916 thinks it is a modified
version of the *cuculla* specially adapted for work. It clearly derives
from the Latin *scapula*, meaning "shoulders", and it may reasonably be
concluded that it was a sleeveless or short-sleeved garment … However,
A. Guillaumont, "Évagre le Pontique: Traité Pratique" (SC 171, Paris,
Éditions du Cerf 1971, p. 488), suggests that the scapular may be the
equivalent to the Greek *analabos*, which Cassian (*inst.* 1,5)
translates uncertainly by three terms: *subcinctoria*, *redimicula* and
*rebracchiatoria*, the purpose of which is to fasten the tunic for
work."

[14] RB 55.6 has unspecific "work", not "manual work" (in RB 48.1 called
"manual labour"), whilst elsewhere there is mention of the "Work of
God", arguably not only in connection with prayer (e.g. RB 7.63, 22.6,
58.7). Apparently therefore RB regards both prayer and labour as "work".
Thus, whether in the oratory or in the fields, a monk is always at work,
and so a "scapular for work" is to be worn always. RB 22.5 supports
those who hold that it is meant to be worn even during the night rest.
These considerations support the view that St Benedict meant the
scapular to be worn not as protective wear but for a symbolic reason,
such as with regard to the purpose of the monk in the monastery. The
monks' purpose is evident from RB's own purpose, which is a compilation
of precepts for those who wish by "the labour of obedience to return to
him from whom they had drifted through the sloth of disobedience" (RB
Prol 2) and therefore, in response to "the Lord seeking his workman in
the multitude of people" (RB Prol 14), undergo "teaching" in "a school
of the Lord's service" (RB Prol 45-50). The wearing of the scapular
therefore seems to signal that the Lord's workman is going about his
master's work. A light or minimal item of clothing, as has been
suggested on linguistic grounds, would be better suited to a symbolic
than a protective use.
