A **Senegalese kaftan** is a [pullover](Sweater "wikilink") men's
[robe](robe "wikilink") with long bell sleeves. In the [Wolof
language](Wolof_language "wikilink"), this robe is called a *mbubb* or
*xaftaan* and in French it is called a *boubou*. The Senegalese caftan
is an ankle length garment. It is worn with matching
[drawstring](drawstring "wikilink") pants called *tubay* in
[Wolof](Wolof_language "wikilink"). Normally made of
[cotton](cotton "wikilink") brocade, [lace](lace "wikilink"), or
synthetic fabrics, these robes are common throughout [West
Africa](West_Africa "wikilink"). A [kaftan](kaftan "wikilink") and
matching pants is called a **kaftan suit**.[1] The kaftan suit can be
worn with a [kufi](kufi "wikilink") cap.[2] Senegalese kaftans are
[formal wear](formal_wear "wikilink") in all West African countries. In
the [United States](United_States "wikilink"), some merchants sell this
robe as a *Senegalese style dashiki pant set* or a *full length dashiki
pant set*. Men who are members of the [Hausa](Hausa_people "wikilink")
tribe, wear these kaftans to formal events like naming ceremonies and
weddings. In the [United States](United_States "wikilink"), a kaftan is
one of three formal suits, equivalent to the
[tuxedo](tuxedo "wikilink"), that
[African-American](African-American "wikilink") grooms select for their
weddings. The other styles being the [dashiki](dashiki "wikilink") pant
set, and the [grand boubou](boubou_(clothing) "wikilink"), pronounced
*gran boo-boo*. There are various other formal robes that are worn
throughout West Africa, and with the exception of the
[Yoruba](Yoruba_people "wikilink") Gbarie robe, pronounced *barry*, most
of these are a form of Islamic dress, see [sartorial
hijab](sartorial_hijab "wikilink"). The kaftan is worn by
[Christians](Christians "wikilink"), [African
Jews](African_Jews "wikilink"), [Muslims](Muslims "wikilink"), and
followers of [African traditional
religion](African_traditional_religion "wikilink"). Furthermore,
Senegalese kaftans are common among men of [African
descent](African_descent "wikilink") in the [African
diaspora](African_diaspora "wikilink"). The Senegalese kaftan is men's
attire. In West Africa, and the United States, this robe is not worn by
[women](women "wikilink"). The women's robe is called a
[kaftan](wrapper_(clothing) "wikilink").

## Wedding attire

![](1917316-Travel_Picture-The_Gambia.jpg "fig:1917316-Travel_Picture-The_Gambia.jpg"),
West Africa.\]\] A white kaftan is worn for weddings. [3] The bride's
attire is a [buba and wrapper set](Wrapper_(clothing) "wikilink") or a
woman's [kaftan](Wrapper_(clothing) "wikilink") that is the same color
as the groom's Senegalese.

## Informal kaftans

Another robe that is occasionally seen in West Africa is the
short-sleeved Moroccan kaftan, also called a [thobe](thawb "wikilink"),
dishdasha, or [jalabiyyah](Jellabiya "wikilink"). These kaftans are used
as pajamas or lounge wear. In the home, they are worn on top of
underwear. Some men wear the Moroccan kaftan outside the home. When worn
outside, it is customary to wear the Moroccan kaftan over a long or
short sleeve [t-shirt](t-shirt "wikilink") or
[turtleneck](Polo_neck "wikilink") and a pair of
[pants](Trousers "wikilink"), [jeans](jeans "wikilink"), or
[shorts](shorts "wikilink"). The Moroccan kaftan can be worn with a
knitted or crown style [kufi](kufi "wikilink") cap. In
[Morocco](Morocco "wikilink"), this robe is called a *gandora*. Although
widely worn, Moroccan kaftans are not formal attire in any West African
country. Recently, some tribes have started to wear the Tanzanian
[kanzu](kanzu "wikilink") for informal occasions, including church
services, or [Friday prayers](Friday_prayers "wikilink") at the mosque.
