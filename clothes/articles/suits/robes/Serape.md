item is more recent.\]\]

The **sarape**, **serape** or **jorongo** is a long
[blanket](blanket "wikilink")-like shawl, often brightly colored and
fringed at the ends, worn in [Mexico](Mexico "wikilink"), especially by
men. The spelling of the word **sarape** [1] (or infrequently,
**zarape**[2]) is the accepted form in Mexico and in other
Spanish-speaking countries. The term *sarape* is for the rectangular
woven blanket (no openings), though in more recent years it can also be
used to refer to a very soft rectangular blanket with an opening in the
middle for one's head, similar to a [poncho](poncho "wikilink") called
*gabán*, or *jorongo* in Mexico. Modern variations of some serapes are
made with matching hoods for head covering. The length varies, but front
and back normally reach knee height on an average person.

Available in various colors and design patterns, the typical colors of
serapes from the highland regions are two-tone combinations of black,
grey, brown, or tan depending on the natural color of the sheep flocks
grown in the area, with large design patterns utilizing traditional
indigenous motifs. On the other hand, the traditional serape as made in
the Mexican state of [Coahuila](Coahuila "wikilink") in north-eastern
Mexico near the city of [Saltillo](Saltillo "wikilink") often consists
of a dark base color with bands of yellow, orange, red, blue, green,
purple or other bright colors. The ends are usually fringed.

## History

The sarape is thought to have its forebears in garments worn in the
region near [Chiautempan](Chiautempan "wikilink") and
[Contla](Contla "wikilink"), [Tlaxcala](Tlaxcala "wikilink"). During the
Colonial period, it was taken to northern [New
Spain](New_Spain "wikilink") where it was adapted to the climate and the
motifs changed. The city of [Saltillo](Saltillo "wikilink") is strongly
linked to the development of the sarape, although it was widespread
throughout the area then known as [Nueva
Vizcaya](Nueva_Vizcaya,_New_Spain "wikilink").

## Guatemalan serape

The serape is not a typical garment for the
[Maya](Maya_people "wikilink") highland people, who wear different
clothing in cold regions. The serape is more of an imitation of the
Mexican serape with a Maya twist, and their production is specifically
for sales to foreigners or city dwellers who feel attracted to the
garment. The sale of sarapes goes through a broker process, where the
Maya families, who depend mostly upon agricultural work, manufacture
small quantities for additional income. The brokers display the sarapes
at a higher price on local markets or the sides of highland roads in
improvised huts. The brokers are typically Maya. The appeal of the
sarape may consist in the fact that these are woven by Maya families,
normally women, in their traditional house looms, giving the sarape a
"handmade" look.
