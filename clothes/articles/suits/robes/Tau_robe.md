A **Tau Robe** is a very simple black or white gown cut to resemble the
Greek letter, "[Tau](Tau "wikilink")," or "T".[1]

## Description

The arms are usually from fingertip to fingertip, and the bottom hem is
usually floor length, as with a ceremonial
[tabard](tabard "wikilink").[2] Both the arms and body of the gown will
flare so that the sleeves being [bell sleeves](bell_sleeve "wikilink"),
are wider at the fingers than at the shoulder, and the bottom wider than
at the chest. This loose fitting helps with maneuverability while
wearing the robe.[3]

## Purpose

The robe is one of the vestments worn in ceremonial magic. Although not
essential, Donald Kraig describes the purpose of wearing the robe as "to
physically show both your conscious and your unconscious that you are no
longer in your daily dress." Kraig goes on to say wearing the robe
indicates a magical and spiritual intent, such as engaging in ritual,
and should be kept exclusively for that purpose.[4]
