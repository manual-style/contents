**Temple robes** describe the ceremonial clothing worn in the
performance of ordinances and ceremonies in a
[temple](temple "wikilink").

## Hebrew Bible tradition

The 28th and 29th chapters of the [Book of
Exodus](Book_of_Exodus "wikilink") describe in detail the ritual
clothing worn by priests in the
[Temple](Temple_in_Jerusalem "wikilink"). The robes consist of a
[breastplate](breastplate "wikilink") (*[hoshen](hoshen "wikilink")*),
an *[ephod](ephod "wikilink")*, a robe
(*[me'il](Priestly_robe_(Judaism) "wikilink")*), a tunic
(*[ketonet](Priestly_tunic "wikilink")*), a cap
(*[mitznefet](Priestly_turban "wikilink")*), and a
[sash](sash "wikilink") (*[avnet](Priestly_sash "wikilink")*), as well
as [stones](Urim_and_Thummim "wikilink") worn in various configurations.

## Latter Day Saint tradition

Members of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints](The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints "wikilink") (LDS
Church) and certain [Mormon
fundamentalists](Mormon_fundamentalist "wikilink") wear ceremonial robes
to perform the [endowment](Endowment_(Latter_Day_Saints) "wikilink") and
[sealing](Sealing_(Latter_Day_Saints) "wikilink") portions of their
[temple](Temple_(LDS_Church) "wikilink")
[ceremonies](Ordinance_(Latter_Day_Saints) "wikilink"). The ceremonial
robes are modeled after those described in the Bible according to
[latter-day revelation](Revelation_(Latter_Day_Saints) "wikilink"). The
clothing includes a [robe](robe "wikilink") that fits over one shoulder,
a [sash](sash "wikilink"), an [apron](apron "wikilink"), a
[veil](veil "wikilink") (for women), and a cap (for men). All of the
clothing is white, including shoes and neckties, except for the apron,
which is green.[1][2] It is common for Latter-day Saints to be
[buried](Burial "wikilink") with the body dressed in their temple
clothes.[3]

This outer temple clothing is distinct from the [temple
garments](temple_garments "wikilink") worn every day as underwear by
Latter-day Saints after they have received an
[endowment](endowment_(Mormonism) "wikilink") in the temple.

## Buddhist tradition

Traditional robes, worn by [monks](monk "wikilink") both within and
without [Buddhist](Buddhist "wikilink") temples, appear in a variety of
configurations. In parts of [Southeast Asia](Southeast_Asia "wikilink"),
the robes consist of a [saffron](saffron "wikilink")-colored mantel over
a red undergarment. In [Japan](Japan "wikilink"), the robe is
traditionally black, grey or blue.
