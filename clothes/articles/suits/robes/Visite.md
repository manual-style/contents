A **visite** is a specific type of woman's outer garment similar to a
[mantle](mantle_(clothing) "wikilink") or
[wrap](wrap_(clothing) "wikilink"). It was particularly popular in the
late 19th century, being specifically designed to accommodate the then
fashionable [bustle](bustle "wikilink").[1] The visite replaced the huge
[shawls](shawl "wikilink") that had previously been worn over large
[crinoline](crinoline "wikilink") skirts, combining shawl and coat
elements, and was even on occasion made using shawls that were valuable
but no longer fashionable.[2][3]
