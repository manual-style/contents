A **witzchoura** (sometimes **witz-chouras**) was a type of
[mantle](mantle_(clothing) "wikilink"), [pelisse](pelisse "wikilink"),
or sleeved [cloak](cloak "wikilink"), with a large collar and,
sometimes, a hood,[1] that was particularly fashionable in the early
19th century.[2] The term derives from the Polish word *wilczura*,
meaning 'wolf fur coat'.[3] It was inspired by Polish styles, hence
sometimes being described as *a la Polonaise*,[4] although it is not the
same as the gown called a [polonaise](polonaise_(clothing) "wikilink").
Like the original [hussar](hussar "wikilink")'s pelisse, it was
typically lined with fur.

The witzchoura is said to have emerged about 1808, soon after
[Napoleon](Napoleon "wikilink") met with his Polish mistress, [Marie
Walewska](Marie_Walewska "wikilink"),[5] and was worn throughout the
first half of the 19th century. Versions of the witzchoura were still
being worn for travelling in 1849.[6]
