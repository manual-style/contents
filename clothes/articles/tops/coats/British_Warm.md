A **British Warm**,[1] **British warm**[2] or **British Warm overcoat**
is a type of woollen overcoat based on the
[greatcoats](greatcoat "wikilink") worn by [British
Army](British_Army "wikilink") officers in the [First World
War](First_World_War "wikilink").[3]

## History

The British warm first appeared around 1914 as a military greatcoat for
British officers. It was made famous, however, by [Winston
Churchill](Winston_Churchill "wikilink").[4] According to Scottish
clothmakers, Crombie, the term "British Warm" was coined to describe
their version of the coat which was worn by around 10% of British
soldiers and officers.[5] The British Warm is currently the only
authorised overcoat for serving officers in the British Army.[6]

## Characteristics

A British warm is typically designed as a heavy, double-breasted, wool
coat made from a 100% wool cloth known as
[Melton](Melton_(cloth) "wikilink").[7] It is
[taupe](taupe "wikilink")-coloured, has [peak
lapels](peak_lapel "wikilink") and leather buttons, often has
[epaulettes](epaulette "wikilink") and is slightly shaped. It falls just
above the knee. It is also sometimes belted.[8][9]
