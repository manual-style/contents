**Chesterfield** is a [formal](formal_wear "wikilink") dark knee-length
[overcoat](overcoat "wikilink") with a [velvet](velvet "wikilink")
collar introduced around the 1840s in the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink"), with prominence attributed to its
namesake [George Stanhope, 6th Earl of
Chesterfield](George_Stanhope,_6th_Earl_of_Chesterfield "wikilink"),
then a leader of British fashion.[1] [2]

The Chesterfield coat, with its heavy waist suppression using a waist
seam, gradually replaced the [over-frock
coat](over-frock_coat "wikilink") during the second half of the 19th
century as a choice for a formal overcoat, and survived as a coat of
choice over the progression from [frock coat](frock_coat "wikilink")
everyday wear to the introduction of the [lounge
suit](lounge_suit "wikilink"), but remained principally associated with
formal [morning dress](morning_dress "wikilink") and [white
tie](white_tie "wikilink").

A less formal derivation is the similar but lighter fabric, slightly
shorter [top coat](Overcoat "wikilink") called [covert
coat](covert_coat "wikilink").

The dark Chesterfield, which comes with a defining
[velvet](velvet "wikilink") [collar](collar_(clothing) "wikilink")[3]
has no horizontal seam or sidebodies, but can still be somewhat shaped
using the side seams and darts. It can be single- or double-breasted,
and has been popular in a wide variety of fabrics, typically heavier
weight [tweeds](tweed_(cloth) "wikilink"), or charcoal and navy, and
even the [camel hair](camel_hair "wikilink") classic, although such
fabrics may be more associated with a more
[casual](casual_wear "wikilink") [polo coat](polo_coat "wikilink").
These variations make it extremely versatile, so it can be worn with a
city suit or even [semi-formal](semi-formal "wikilink") dress, as well
as casual [sports jackets](sports_jacket "wikilink"). It was a staple of
smartly dressed men's wardrobes from the 1920s to 1960s, and has become
a classic style for both men and even women.[4]
