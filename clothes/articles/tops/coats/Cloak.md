A **cloak** is a type of loose [garment](garment "wikilink") that is
worn over indoor [clothing](clothing "wikilink") and serves the same
purpose as an [overcoat](overcoat "wikilink"); it protects the wearer
from the cold, rain or wind for example, or it may form part of a
fashionable outfit or [uniform](uniform "wikilink"). Cloaks have been
used by myriad historic societies; many climates favor wearing a
full-body garment which is easily removed and does not constrain the
wearer with sleeves. Over time cloak designs have been changed to match
fashion and available [textiles](textile "wikilink").

Cloaks generally fasten at the neck or over the shoulder, vary in
length, from hip all the way down to the ankle, mid-calf being the
normal length. They may have an attached
[hood](hood_(headgear) "wikilink") and may cover and fasten down the
front, in which case they have holes or slits for the hands to pass
through. However, cloaks are almost always sleeveless.

## Etymology

The word *cloak* comes from Old North French *cloque* ([Old
French](Old_French "wikilink") *cloche*, *cloke*) meaning "travelling
cloak", from [Medieval Latin](Medieval_Latin "wikilink") *clocca*
"travelers' cape," literally "a bell," so called from the garment's
bell-like shape. Thus the word is related to the word *clock*.[1]

## History

Ancient Greeks and Romans were known to wear cloaks. Greek men and women
wore the *[himation](himation "wikilink")*, from the Archaic through the
Hellenistic periods (c. 750-30 BC).[2] Romans would later wear the
Greek-styled cloak, the *[pallium](pallium_(Roman_cloak) "wikilink")*.
The *pallium* was quadrangular, shaped like a square,[3] and sat on the
shoulders, not unlike the *himation*.

Romans of the Republic would wear the [toga](toga "wikilink") as a
formal display of their citizenship. It was denied to foreigners[4] and
was worn by magistrates on all occasions as a badge of office. The toga
was claimed to have originated with [Numa
Pompilius](Numa_Pompilius "wikilink"), the second king of Rome.[5]

## Opera cloak

In full [evening dress](formal_wear "wikilink") in the Western
countries, [ladies](lady "wikilink") and
[gentlemen](gentleman "wikilink") frequently use the cloak as a [fashion
statement](fashion_statement "wikilink"), or to protect the fine
[fabrics](Textile "wikilink") of evening wear from the elements,
especially where a [coat](coat_(clothing) "wikilink") would crush or
hide the garment. Opera cloaks are made of quality materials such as
wool or cashmere, velvet and satin.

Ladies may wear a long (over the shoulders or to ankles) cloak usually
called a [cape](cape "wikilink"), or a full-length cloak. Gentlemen wear
an ankle-length or full-length cloak. Formal cloaks often have
expensive, colored linings and trimmings such as
[silk](silk "wikilink"), [satin](satin "wikilink"),
[velvet](velvet "wikilink") and [fur](fur "wikilink").

According to the [King James Version](King_James_Version "wikilink") of
the Bible, Matthew recorded Jesus of Galilee saying in Matthew 5:40:
"And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let
him have thy cloke also." The King James Version of the Bible has the
words recorded a little differently in Luke 6:29: "...and him that
taketh away thy cloke, forbid not to take thy coat also."

Cloaks are a staple garment in the [fantasy](fantasy "wikilink") genre
due to the popularity of [medieval](medieval "wikilink") settings,
although fantasy cloak designs normally have more resemblance to 18th or
19th-century cloaks rather than medieval ones. They are also usually
associated with [witches](witch "wikilink"),
[wizards](Wizard_(fantasy) "wikilink"), and
[vampires](vampire "wikilink"); the best-known stage version of
*[Dracula](Dracula_(novel) "wikilink"),* which first made actor [Bela
Lugosi](Bela_Lugosi "wikilink") prominent, featured him wearing it so
that his exit through a trap door concealed on the stage could seem
sudden. When Lugosi reprised his role as Dracula for the 1931 [Universal
Studios](Universal_Studios "wikilink") motion picture version of the
play, he retained the cloak as part of his outfit, which made such a
strong impression that cloaks came to be equated with [Count
Dracula](Count_Dracula "wikilink") in nearly all non-historical media
depictions of him.

Fantasy cloaks are often [magical](Magic_(paranormal) "wikilink"). For
example, they may grant the person wearing it
[invisibility](invisibility "wikilink") as in the *[Harry
Potter](Harry_Potter "wikilink")* series by [J. K.
Rowling](J._K._Rowling "wikilink"). A similar sort of garment is worn by
the members of the Fellowship of the Ring in *[The Lord of the
Rings](The_Lord_of_the_Rings "wikilink")* by [J. R. R.
Tolkien](J._R._R._Tolkien "wikilink"), although instead of granting
complete invisibility, the Elf-made cloaks simply appear to shift
between any natural color (e.g. green, gray, brown) to help the wearer
to blend in with his or her surroundings. In the
[Marvel](Marvel_Comics "wikilink") [comic
book](American_comic_books "wikilink") stories and in the [Marvel
Cinematic Universe](Marvel_Cinematic_Universe "wikilink"), the sorcerer
[Doctor Strange](Doctor_Strange "wikilink") is associated with a magical
[Cloak of Levitation](Cloak_of_Levitation "wikilink"), which not only
enables its wearer to [levitate](levitation "wikilink"), but has other
mystical abilities as well. Alternatively, cloaks in fantasy may nullify
magical [projectiles](projectile "wikilink"), as the "cloak of magic
resistance" in [NetHack](NetHack "wikilink"). In [Greek
mythology](Greek_mythology "wikilink"), the magical
[hide](Hide_(skin) "wikilink") [armor](armor "wikilink") that
[Hercules](Hercules "wikilink") made for himself from the skin of the
[Nemean Lion](Nemean_Lion "wikilink"), at the end of Hercules' first
labor, might also be seen as an early idea of a magical cloak. This
latter was notable because it was said to be impervious to *all* cutting
and impact weapons.

## Metaphor

Figuratively, a cloak may be anything that disguises or conceals
something. In many science fiction worlds, such as *[Star
Trek](Star_Trek "wikilink")*, there are [cloaking
devices](cloaking_devices "wikilink"), which provide a way to avoid
detection by making objects appear invisible.

Because they keep a person hidden and conceal a weapon, the phrase
*[cloak and dagger](cloak_and_dagger "wikilink")* has come to refer to
[espionage](espionage "wikilink") and [secretive](secretive "wikilink")
crimes: it suggests murder from hidden sources. "Cloak and dagger"
stories are thus mystery, detective, and crime stories of this. The
vigilante duo of Marvel comics [Cloak and
Dagger](Cloak_and_Dagger_(comics) "wikilink") is a reference to this.
