![](Covert_Coat.jpg "fig:Covert_Coat.jpg")s and black
[velvet](velvet "wikilink") collar, made by
[Aquascutum](Aquascutum "wikilink").\]\] A **covert coat** or **Crombie
coat** is a gentleman's [overcoat](overcoat "wikilink") typically with
notched [lapels](lapel "wikilink") which originated in the late 19th
century as a "short [topcoat](Overcoat "wikilink")" to be worn for
[hunting](hunting "wikilink") and [horse
riding](horse_riding "wikilink").[1][2]

Since the 20th century, after the introduction of the
[suit](suit "wikilink") for everyday use in town as opposed to the
[frock coat](frock_coat "wikilink") and the [morning
dress](morning_dress "wikilink"), the covert coat is used as a shorter,
more [informal](Informal_wear "wikilink") topcoat option to the longer
knee-length [chesterfield coat](chesterfield_coat "wikilink")
traditionally associated with [formal wear](formal_wear "wikilink").

## Design

Covert cloth, from which the coat is made, is a heavy
[tweed](tweed_(cloth) "wikilink") named after a covered area rich in
game wildlife that would serve as a starting point on a hunt.[3] A
covert coat is always single-breasted with notch lapels, a centre vent,
flap pockets, and a signature four (sometimes five) lines of stitching
at the cuffs and hem; a ticket pocket is optional. The collar may be
constructed of covert cloth or velvet.[4] The traditional colour varies
from a light greenish-tan brown to a fawnish mix to a rather deep
tannish-green, but variants in grey and navy are also common.[5]

## Notable wearers

Variants were worn by [George VI](George_VI "wikilink") and [Edward
VIII](Edward_VIII "wikilink"), as well as by [Jason
Statham](Jason_Statham "wikilink") and [Stephen
Graham](Stephen_Graham_(actor) "wikilink") in the 2000 crime comedy film
*[Snatch](Snatch_(film) "wikilink")*.[6] The covert coat caused media
attention during the [2015 General
Election](2015_United_Kingdom_general_election "wikilink") in
[UK](UK "wikilink") when worn by [UKIP](UKIP "wikilink") and later
[Brexit Party](Brexit_Party "wikilink") leader [Nigel
Farage](Nigel_Farage "wikilink").[7]
