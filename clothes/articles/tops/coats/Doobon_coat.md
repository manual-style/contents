![](Bethlehem1978.jpg "fig:Bethlehem1978.jpg"), 1978\]\] A **Doobon
coat** ([Hebrew](Hebrew "wikilink"): מעיל דובון, me'eel Doobon) is a
resistant [coat](Coat_(clothing) "wikilink"), made with padded nylon
cover with cloth [lining](lining_(sewing) "wikilink") waterproof outer
layer of filling between them isolated synthetic fibers. This coat has a
regular [hood](Hood_(headgear) "wikilink"). This is a coat designed for
people who stay outdoors for a long time on cold days, such as soldiers
and laborers.

## Background

This coat was first produced in 1971 by the [Logistics
Corps](Logistics_Corps "wikilink") for the [Israel Defense
Forces](Israel_Defense_Forces "wikilink") soldiers, and is a part of the
[Israel Defense Forces](Israel_Defense_Forces "wikilink") [mess
dress](mess_dress "wikilink"). It replaced the heavy woolen
[Greatcoat](Greatcoat "wikilink") and the United States
[Battledress](Battledress "wikilink") coat. The original Doobon coat
colors were olive for most soldiers and blue for the [air
force](Israeli_air_force "wikilink") and
[navy](Israeli_navy "wikilink"). These are almost the only colors it
comes in, to date, although *Khagor* ("חגור") Ltd. received a concession
to use the brand *Doobon* for coats sold both to the IDF and to
civilians.

Out of the army, this coat is worn mostly by Israelis who have to stay
outdoors for long hours on winter time, and by those who belong to
[Zionist](Zionism "wikilink") groups that manifest opposing trendy and
fashion clothing.[1] The Doobon coat is a sign of [Modern Orthodox
Judaism](Modern_Orthodox_Judaism "wikilink")[2] and residents of the
[Israeli settlements](Israeli_settlement "wikilink"),[3] as well as for
[socialist](socialist "wikilink") Zionists, including
[Kibbutz](Kibbutz "wikilink") members.

The Doobon coat symbolizes being an Israeli in the work of various
artists, including those of [Yehonatan
Geffen](Yehonatan_Geffen "wikilink"). In his *Ballad of
[Druze](Druze "wikilink")*, he [rhymed](rhyme "wikilink") the words
*Druze* (in Hebrew "Droozy" דרוזי) and *[Uzi](Uzi "wikilink")*, and
phrased "Well, with the Doobon and the Uzi, who can see he is a Druze?"

The [Argentine Army](Argentine_Army "wikilink") used this coat during
the [Falklands War](Falklands_War "wikilink"), and produced its own
version.

[1] On Liora Rosenfeld-blumgarten book, ‘’Blood oranges’’, the pesticide
agent says "in that respect, that of dressing, my job is most
convenient: mat [jeans](jeans "wikilink"), [flannel](flannel "wikilink")
shirts, Doobon military coat on rainy days. Only very rarely, when I am
going to meet for the first time with a customer, who, I was told was a
specifically successful dairy farming or chicken coop, or one who
considers himself to be a real businessman, I am slightly improving my
clothing. "
