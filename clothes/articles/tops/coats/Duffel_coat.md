A **duffel coat** (also **duffle coat**, for example in Canada) is a
coat made from [duffel](Duffel#Duffel_cloth "wikilink"), a coarse,
thick, woolen material. The name derives from
[Duffel](Duffel "wikilink"), a town in the province of
[Antwerp](Antwerp "wikilink") in [Belgium](Belgium "wikilink") where the
fabric originated. [Duffel bags](Duffel_bag "wikilink") were originally
made from the same material. The hood and toggle fastenings proved
popular, and the coat spread across Europe by the 1850s. By 1890 it was
being supplied to the British Royal Navy. After [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink"), the coats became available as government
surplus stock and became popular, especially with students.

## Description

There are many variations of duffel coat. The basic British style
features:

-   Genuine double weave woolen [duffel
    fabric](Duffel#Duffel_cloth "wikilink"), lined with a woolly
    [tartan](tartan "wikilink") pattern, or plain in the military
    version.
-   Three or, later, four front wooden or horn toggle and leather
    fastenings.
-   Two large outside patch pockets, with covering flaps on post-war
    versions.
-   Originally knee length; shorter on later versions.
-   A buttonable neck strap.
-   Bucket hood with press stud adjustment. Later versions feature a
    neater "pancake" hood.

The toggle-fastenings are made to be easily fastened and unfastened
while wearing gloves in cold weather. Current designs often feature
imitation plastic buffalo horn. The original hood was oversized to allow
room for a Naval cap. Early versions were knee-length but later ones
were shorter.

## History

The initial influence of what became the duffel coat, may have been the
hooded Polish military [frock coat](frock_coat "wikilink"), which was
developed in the 1820s. It had the unusual features of a toggle closure
and an integrated hood,[1] and by 1850 had spread through Europe.[2] In
the 1850s, British outerwear manufacturer John Partridge developed the
first version of the duffle coat.[3]

In the 1890s the British Admiralty purchased the coat in quantity for
the [Royal Navy](Royal_Navy "wikilink") from multiple manufacturers,[4]
where it was referred to as the "convoy coat".[5] The navy issued a
camel-coloured variant during [World War I](World_War_I "wikilink"), The
character played by [Trevor Howard](Trevor_Howard "wikilink") in the
1949 movie *[The Third Man](The_Third_Man "wikilink")*, British Major
Calloway, wears a standard issue Army duffel coat in numerous scenes.

The design of the coat was modified slightly and widely issued during
[World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"). It became known under the
nickname "[Monty](Bernard_Montgomery "wikilink") coat". [6] [7]

Large post-war stocks of low-cost military surplus coats turned the
duffel into a ubiquitous item of British civilian clothing in the 1950s
and 1960s, especially among students. The firm Gloverall purchased large
quantities, and in 1954 started producing their own version using
leather fastenings and [buffalo
horn](Water_buffalo#Husbandry "wikilink") toggles with a double-faced
check lining, and many other modern versions copy some or all of those
features.[8]

## Today

![](Duffell_coat_(2210293264).jpg "fig:Duffell_coat_(2210293264).jpg")Today,
the duffel coat is often made of [Melton
cloth](Melton_(cloth) "wikilink"), as opposed to modern duffel cloth
which is a softer wool fabric with a distinct nap, used for high-end
coats and [parkas](parka "wikilink").

In Italy as well as in Greece, the duffle coat is called a 'Montgomery',
after [Field Marshal Sir Bernard
Montgomery](Bernard_Montgomery "wikilink"), who often wore one during
World War II. [9] [10]
