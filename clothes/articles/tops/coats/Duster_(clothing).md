A **duster** is a light, loose-fitting long
[coat](Coat_(clothing) "wikilink"). The original dusters were
full-length, light-colored [canvas](canvas "wikilink") or
[linen](linen "wikilink") coats worn by [horsemen](Cowboy "wikilink") to
protect their clothing from trail dust. These dusters were typically
slit up the back to hip level for ease of wear on horseback. Dusters
intended for riding may have features such as a buttonable rear slit and
leg straps to hold the flaps in place. For better protection against
rain, dusters were made from [oilcloth](oilcloth "wikilink") and later
from [waxed cotton](waxed_cotton "wikilink"). Dusters were the
recommended "uniform" for [Texas
Rangers](Texas_Ranger_Division "wikilink").

raid](Joseph_Lee_Heywood#The_Northfield_Bank_Raid "wikilink"), 1876.\]\]

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, both men and women wore
dusters to protect their clothes when riding in open
[motorcars](automobile "wikilink") on the dirt roads of the day.[1]

Western horsemen's dusters figured little in [Western
films](Western_(genre)#Film "wikilink") until [Sergio
Leone](Sergio_Leone "wikilink") re-introduced them in his movies *[The
Good, the Bad, and the
Ugly](The_Good,_the_Bad,_and_the_Ugly "wikilink")* (1966) and *[Once
Upon a Time in the West](Once_Upon_a_Time_in_the_West "wikilink")*
(1968). The latter played for many months in [Paris](Paris "wikilink")
and was in part credited with a revival of the duster in men's fashions
in that city. Similarly, in the film genre of [heroic
bloodshed](heroic_bloodshed "wikilink"), primarily through [Chow Yun
Fat](Chow_Yun_Fat "wikilink") and [John Woo](John_Woo "wikilink"), the
hero is often seen wearing a duster. That is also true of the fictional
anti-hero [Omar Little](Omar_Little "wikilink"), who wears dusters both
as outerwear and as a silk sleepwear coverup[2] in the
[HBO](HBO "wikilink") series, *[The Wire](The_Wire "wikilink")*.[3][4]

Dusters gained renewed popularity in the late 20th century and are now a
standard item of [Western wear](Western_wear "wikilink"). The [Tenth
Doctor](Tenth_Doctor "wikilink") played by [David
Tennant](David_Tennant "wikilink") wore a light brown supersuede duster
coat on [Doctor Who](Doctor_Who "wikilink"). Van Pelt, the main enemy on
[Jumanji: Welcome to the
Jungle](Jumanji:_Welcome_to_the_Jungle "wikilink") wore a dark brown
duster coat.

In modern times, leather dusters are worn by
[motorcyclists](motorcycling "wikilink") to prevent [road
rash](road_rash "wikilink").
