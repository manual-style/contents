A **frock coat** is a man's [coat](coat_(clothing) "wikilink")
characterised by a knee-length skirt (often cut just above the knee) all
around the base, popular during the
[Victorian](Victorian_era "wikilink") and
[Edwardian](Edwardian "wikilink") periods. The double-breasted styled
frock coat is sometimes called a **Prince Albert** after [Prince
Albert](Albert,_Prince_Consort "wikilink"),
[consort](Prince_consort "wikilink") to [Queen
Victoria](Queen_Victoria "wikilink"). The frock coat is a fitted,
long-sleeved coat with a centre vent at the back and some features
unusual in post-Victorian dress. These include the reverse collar and
lapels, where the outer edge of the lapel is cut from a separate piece
of cloth from the main body and also a high degree of waist suppression,
where the coat's diameter round the waist is much less than round the
chest. This is achieved by a high horizontal waist seam with side
bodies, which are extra panels of fabric above the waist used to pull in
the naturally cylindrical drape.

The frock coat was originally widely worn in much the same day-to-day
professional situations as modern [lounge suits](lounge_suit "wikilink")
but gradually came to embody the most [formal
attire](formal_attire "wikilink"), with different variations. One
example is that a frock coat for [formalwear](formalwear "wikilink") was
always [double-breasted](double-breasted "wikilink") with peaked
[lapels](lapel "wikilink") and came with
[waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink"). Until the 1860s it usually came with
black trousers, although starting from that time it became more common
to wear it with charcoal grey, often pin striped [formal
trousers](formal_trousers "wikilink"). As daily [informal
wear](informal_wear "wikilink"), the
[single-breasted](single-breasted "wikilink") frock coat often sported
the step or notched, [lapel](lapel "wikilink") (the cause of its
informality) and was more common in the early 19th century than the
formal model.

In the late 19th century, the [dress coat](dress_coat "wikilink"),
[morning coat](morning_coat "wikilink") and [lounge
suit](lounge_suit "wikilink") all evolved from the frock coat. The dress
coat and the morning coat are knee length coats like the frock coat and
traditionally share the waist seam of the precursor frock coat but
differ in the cut of the skirt The frock coat does not have the cut-away
front which gives dress coats and morning coats tails at the back. As
was usual with all coats in the 19th century, shoulder padding was rare
or minimal. The formal frock coat only buttons down to the waist seam,
which is decorated at the back with a pair of buttons. A frock coat that
buttoned up to the neck, forming a high, stand-up collar, was worn only
by clergymen.

## Name

The name frock coat appeared out from the earlier
[frock](frock "wikilink").

Earlier terminology also used *redingote* (or redingotte, redingot),[1]
derived from a French [alteration](Corruption_(linguistics) "wikilink")
of the English "[riding coat](riding_coat "wikilink")", an example of
[reborrowing](reborrowing "wikilink").

## History

![](Man's_3-piece_velvet_suit_c._1755.jpg "fig:Man's_3-piece_velvet_suit_c._1755.jpg"),
the precursor to the frock coat fashionable from the 1660s until the
1790s.\]\] Frock coats emerged during the [Napoleonic
Wars](Napoleonic_Wars "wikilink"), where they were worn by officers in
the Austrian and various German armies during campaign. They efficiently
kept the wearer warm as well as protecting his uniform. Privates and
non-commissioned officers would wear [greatcoats](greatcoats "wikilink")
on campaign.

### The earlier *frock*

![](Man's_silk_and_wool_twill_frock_coat_c._1820.jpg "fig:Man's_silk_and_wool_twill_frock_coat_c._1820.jpg"),
M.2010.33.7.. However resembling the precedessing 18th century
[frock](frock "wikilink").\]\] During the mid 17th century the older
[doublets](Doublet_(clothing) "wikilink"),
[ruffs](ruff_(clothing) "wikilink"), [paned
hose](Hose_(clothing) "wikilink") and
[jerkins](jerkin_(garment) "wikilink") were replaced by the precursor to
the [three piece suit](three_piece_suit "wikilink") comprising
[waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink"), tight [breeches](breeches "wikilink")
and a long coat called a [justacorps](justacorps "wikilink"), topped by
a [powdered wig](powdered_wig "wikilink") and [tricorne
hat](tricorne_hat "wikilink") . This coat, popularised by [Louis
XIII](Louis_XIII "wikilink") of France and [Charles II of
England](Charles_II_of_England "wikilink"), was knee length and looser
fitting than the later frock coat, with turn-back cuffs and two rows of
buttons. English and French noblemen often wore expensive
[brocade](brocade "wikilink") coats decorated with
[velvet](velvet "wikilink"), [gold braid](gold_braid "wikilink"),
embroidery and gold buttons to demonstrate their wealth.[2]

Before the frock coat existed, there was another garment called the
*[frock](frock "wikilink")* in the 18th century, which was probably
unrelated to the frock *coat*, sharing only a similarity in name. The
earlier frock was originally country clothing that increasingly became
common around 1730. Formal dress was then so elaborate that it was
impractical for everyday wear, so the frock became fashionable as [half
dress](half_dress "wikilink"), a less formal alternative. By the 1780s
the frock was worn widely as town wear and, towards the end of the 18th
century, started to be made with a single-breasted cut away front and
tails. It was thus the precursor to the modern [dress
coat](dress_coat "wikilink") worn with [white tie](white_tie "wikilink")
[dress code](dress_code "wikilink").

These relations can be seen in similar foreign terms. The modern word
for a [dress coat](dress_coat "wikilink") in Italian, French, Romanian
and Spanish is *frac*; in German and Scandinavian languages *Frack*; and
Portuguese *fraque*, used in the late 18th century to describe a garment
very similar to the frock, being a single or double-breasted garment
with a diagonally cutaway front in the manner of a modern [morning
coat](morning_coat "wikilink"). Even coats with horizontally cut away
skirts like a [dress coat](dress_coat "wikilink") were referred to as a
*frock* in the late eighteenth and very early 19th century, before being
renamed to *[dress coat](dress_coat "wikilink")*.

This suggests that the earlier frock from the 18th century is more the
direct ancestor of the modern dress coat, whereas the frock *coat* in
the 19th century, the subject under discussion here, is a different
garment altogether with separate military origins in the 19th century.
However a remote historical connection to the frock cannot entirely be
excluded, as is the case with similar looks variably referred to as
[redingote](redingote "wikilink") or [riding
coat](riding_coat "wikilink").

Other meanings of the term *frock* include clerical garb and a type of
woman's [dress](dress "wikilink") combining a skirt with a shirt–blouse
top.

### Military uniforms

soldier in frock coat, 1815\]\]
![](French_Light_Infantry.gif "fig:French_Light_Infantry.gif") French
[Light Infantry](Light_Infantry "wikilink")\]\] The first military frock
coats were issued late in the [Napoleonic
Wars](Napoleonic_Wars "wikilink") to French [line
infantry](line_infantry "wikilink") and Prussian
[Landwehr](Landwehr "wikilink") troops.[3] Unwilling to soil the
expensive [tail coats](tail_coat "wikilink") on campaign, the French
adopted a loose fitting single-breasted coat with contrasting collar and
cuffs. The Germans, having been devastated by years of war, were unable
to afford elaborate uniforms like the British line infantry and chose a
[peaked cap](peaked_cap "wikilink") and double-breasted blue coat,[4]
again with contrasting collar and cuffs, as these were cheaper to
produce for the large numbers of recruits, smart enough for [full
dress](full_dress "wikilink") and more practical for campaigns.

By the 1840s, frock coats were regulation for the American, Prussian,
Russian[5] and French armies. By 1834 officers of the British Army had
adopted a dark blue/black frock coat for ordinary duties, derived from
an earlier greatcoat worn during the Napoleonic period.[6] [US
army](US_army "wikilink") officers were first issued navy blue frocks
during the [Mexican War](Mexican–American_War "wikilink"), with gold
[epaulettes](epaulette "wikilink") and [peaked
caps](peaked_cap "wikilink") of the German pattern. Enlisted
[USMC](United_States_Marine_Corps "wikilink") personnel received a
[double breasted](double_breasted "wikilink") version with red piping
worn with a [leather stock](leather_stock "wikilink") and
[shako](shako "wikilink") to reflect their status as an elite unit.
Infantry soldiers continued to be issued the 1833 pattern [shell
jacket](shell_jacket "wikilink") until the [M1858
uniform](M1858_uniform "wikilink") complete with French style
[kepi](kepi "wikilink") entered service shortly before the [US Civil
War](US_Civil_War "wikilink").[7]

### The earlier *redingote*

The men's *redingote* was an 18th-century or early 19th century long
coat or greatcoat, derived from the country garment with a wide, flat
[collar](collar_(clothing) "wikilink") called a
*[frock](frock "wikilink")*. In French and several other languages,
*redingote* is the usual term for a fitted frock coat. The form a men's
redingote took could be of the tightly fitting frock coat style or the
more voluminous, loose "great coat" style, replete with overlapping
capes or collars, such as a "garrick" redingote, depending on fashion
throughout its popularity.

### The origins and rise of the frock coat

wearing a black frock coat with silk-faced lapels and bow tie\]\]
![](Versailles_1919.jpg "fig:Versailles_1919.jpg") in 1919.\]\]

When the frock coat was first worn, correct daytime full dress was a
[dress coat](dress_coat "wikilink"). The frock coat began as a form of
undress, the clothing worn instead of the dress coat in more informal
situations. The coat itself was possibly of military origin. Towards the
end of the 1820s, it started to be cut with a waist seam to make it more
fitted, with an often marked waist suppression and exaggerated flair of
the skirt. This [hour-glass](hour-glass "wikilink") figure persisted
into the 1840s. As the frock coat became more widely established around
the 1850s, it started to become accepted as formal day time full dress,
thus relegating the dress coat exclusively to evening full dress, where
it remains today as a component of [white tie](white_tie "wikilink"). At
this period, the frock coat became the most standard form of coat for
formal day time dress. Through most of the [Victorian
era](Victorian_era "wikilink") it continued to be worn in similar
situations those in which the [lounge suit](lounge_suit "wikilink") is
worn today such as in weddings, funerals and by professionals. It was
the standard business attire of the Victorian era.

[Prince Albert](Albert,_Prince_Consort "wikilink"), consort to [Queen
Victoria](Queen_Victoria "wikilink"), is usually credited with
popularising the frock coat and even gave a synonym for its
double-breasted version, a "Prince Albert". During the Victorian era,
the frock coat rapidly became worn universally in Britain, Europe and
America as standard formal business dress or for formal daytime events.
It was considered the most correct form of [morning
dress](morning_dress "wikilink") for the time.

Notably, however, this time was before contemporary established dress
code terminology and so definitions of [formal
attire](formal_attire "wikilink"), as well as morning and evening
attire, was not altogether according to later standards.

### The decline of the frock coat

Around the 1880s and increasingly through into the [Edwardian
era](Edwardian_era "wikilink"), an adaptation of the [riding
coat](riding_coat "wikilink") called a Newmarket coat, that rapidly and
ever since became known as a [morning coat](morning_coat "wikilink"),
began to supplant the frock coat as daytime [full
dress](full_dress "wikilink"). Once considered a casual equestrian
sports coat, the morning coat slowly started to become both acceptable
and increasingly popular, as a standard day-time town full dress
alternative to the frock coat, a position which the morning coat enjoys
to this day.

The morning coat was particularly popular amongst fashionable younger
men and the frock coat increasingly came to be worn mostly by older
conservative gentlemen. The morning coat gradually relegated the frock
coat only to more formal situations, to the point that the frock coat
eventually came to be worn only as [court](court_dress "wikilink") and
[diplomatic dress](diplomatic_dress "wikilink").

The [lounge suit](lounge_suit "wikilink") was once only worn as smart
leisure wear in the country or at the seaside but in the middle of the
19th century started to rise rapidly in popularity. It took on the role
of a more [casual](casual_attire "wikilink") alternative to the [morning
coat](morning_coat "wikilink") for town wear, moving the latter up in
the scale of formality. The more the morning coat became fashionable as
correct daytime full dress, the more the lounge suit became acceptable
as an informal alternative. Finally the frock coat became relegated to
the status of ultra-formal day wear, worn only by older men. At the most
formal events during the signing of the [Treaty of
Versailles](Treaty_of_Versailles "wikilink") in 1919, heads of
government wore the frock coat but at more informal meetings they wore
morning coats or even a lounge suit. In 1926, [George
V](George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") hastened the demise of the
frock coat when he shocked the public by appearing at the opening of the
Chelsea Flower Show wearing a morning coat. The frock coat barely
survived the 1930s only as an ultra-formal form of court dress, until
being finally officially abolished in 1936 as official court dress by
Edward VIII (who later abdicated to become the [Duke of
Windsor](Duke_of_Windsor "wikilink")). It was replaced by the morning
coat, thus consigning the frock coat protocol-wise to the status of
historic dress at the [British royal
court](British_royal_court "wikilink").

Since that time it has been worn sparingly, albeit arguably not
altogether vanished (see section on contemporary use further below).

## Composition

### Formal wear

Frock coats worn with [waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink") and [formal
striped trousers](spongebag_trousers "wikilink") are still very
occasionally worn as daytime [formal wear](formal_wear "wikilink"),
especially to [weddings](wedding "wikilink"), as an alternative to
[morning coats](morning_coats "wikilink"), in order to give the wedding
attire a Victorian flavour. They are today usually only worn by the
wedding party, where elements of historical costume are more acceptable
and even this practice is unusual, as its role as a formal ceremonial
coat in daytime formal wear has been long supplanted in modern dress
code by the morning coat. Like morning coats, frock coats are only worn
for daytime formal events before 5pm. and no later than until around
7pm.

Prior to the establishment of [morning dress](morning_dress "wikilink")
around the turn of the century in 1900, the expression "morning dress"
tended to refer to frock coat, while gradually extending to mean both
the frock coat and *morning dress* in the contemporary sense.[8]

#### Cloth

Standard fibres used for the frock coat included [wool](wool "wikilink")
and [vicuña](vicuña "wikilink"). The most common weave was known as
broadcloth. The standard colour of a frock coat was solid black but
later, in the [Victorian era](Victorian_era "wikilink"), charcoal grey
became an acceptable but less common alternative and Midnight Blue was
an even rarer alternative colour. For business and festive occasions the
[revers](revers "wikilink") was lined with black silk facings (either
[satin](satin "wikilink") or [grosgrain](grosgrain "wikilink")). For
funerals black frock coats without self-faced revers were worn with a
matching black waistcoat.

On more formal outings the coat was worn with a pair of cashmere striped
morning trousers: ([*cashmere stripes*](spongebag_trousers "wikilink")
refers to the muted design in black, silver and charcoal grey, not the
fibres of the cloth.) However, trousers of muted checks were also worn
in slightly more informal situations. In keeping with the rules set for
[morning dress](morning_dress "wikilink"), trousers matching the coat
were considered a somewhat less formal alternative.

A matching black [waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink") was worn for more
formal business or more solemn ceremonies. During the earlier Victorian
period, colourful fancy waistcoats of silk were noted as being worn by
gentlemen such as [Charles Dickens](Charles_Dickens "wikilink"). In
summer a white or buff coloured linen waistcoat could be worn. For
festive occasions a lighter coloured waistcoat such as light grey was
permissible.

#### Cut

The length of the skirt of the frock coat varied during the [Victorian
era](Victorian_era "wikilink") and [Edwardian
era](Edwardian_era "wikilink") according to fashion. The most
conservative length became established as being to the knees but fashion
conscious men would follow the latest trends to wear them either longer
or shorter. Similarly, the height of the waist – the point of maximal
waist suppression – changed according to fashion. During its heyday, the
frock coat was cut following the 19th century ideal of flattering the
natural elegance of the naked figure, based on the ideals of
[Neoclassicism](Neoclassicism "wikilink") that admired the depiction of
the idealised nude in Classical Greco-Roman sculpture. The elegance of
the form of the frock coat derived from its
[hourglass](hourglass "wikilink") shape with a closely cut waist which
at times around the 1830s-40's was reinforced further with padding to
round out the chest. A cut with an ideal hourglass silhouette was
achievable because coats during this era were all made
[bespoke](bespoke "wikilink"), individually cut to the exact
measurements of the customer. The 19th century aesthetics of tailoring
contrasted markedly to the modern style of cutting suits which involves
a greater degree of drape (fullness), as established by the great early
20th century [Savile Row](Savile_Row "wikilink") tailor [Frederick
Scholte](Frederick_Scholte "wikilink"). Caution needs to be exercised by
modern tailors trained to create the drape cut style of modern [lounge
suits](lounge_suit "wikilink") to minimise drape – particularly around
the waist – when cutting a historically accurate frock coat. Sometimes,
modern lounge suit coats with an unusually long skirt are referred to by
[ready-to-wear](ready-to-wear "wikilink") makers as a 'frock coat' but
these lack the waist seam, resulting in the fuller drape more typical of
a modern [overcoat](overcoat "wikilink") or a lounge suit jacket. The
silhouette of the historically accurate frock coat has the waist seam
precisely tailored to permit the classical and elongating hourglass
figure with the strong waist suppression.

#### Details

![](Oscar_Wilde_3.jpg "fig:Oscar_Wilde_3.jpg") (1854-1900) wearing a
frock coat with a chest pocket sporting a [pocket
square](pocket_square "wikilink") and a pinned cravat in a Ruche knot.
Frock coats with any external pockets at all are a rarity.\]\]

Another characteristic of frock coats was their lack of any outer
pockets. Only late in the Victorian and [Edwardian
era](Edwardian_era "wikilink") were they ever made with a chest pocket
to sport a [pocket square](pocket_square "wikilink"), a feature more
typical of the modern [lounge suit](lounge_suit "wikilink"). [Oscar
Wilde](Oscar_Wilde "wikilink"), a famous [dandy](dandy "wikilink") of
his time, was often seen in portraits wearing just such a model but this
was rather rare on frock coats; while in keeping with the flamboyant
nature of Wilde's dress, it was frowned upon by traditionalists. Side
pockets were always absent from frock coats but pockets were provided on
the inside of the chest or inside the top part of the tail.

The buttons on a frock coat were always covered in cloth, often to match
the silk on the revers, showing in the triangle of lining wrapped over
the inside of the lapels. Another common feature was the use of fancy
buttons with a snow-flake or [check pattern](check_pattern "wikilink")
woven over it.

Through most of the Victorian era until towards the end, the lapels were
cut separately and sewn on later, apparently because it made the lapel
roll more elegantly from bottom up. The lapel revers from the inside of
the coat wrapped over to the front, creating a small triangle of silk,
while the outer half was cut from two strips of the body fabric. This
was a feature of double-breasted frock coats used on all such coats but
morning and dress coats, which had previously followed this practice,
began to be made with attached lapels (wholecut) around the end of the
Edwardian era. Through the Victorian era, a row of decorative button
holes was created down the lapel edge but by Edwardian period these were
reduced down to just the one lapel [boutonnière](boutonnière "wikilink")
button hole.

Turn back cuffs on the sleeves, similar to the turn ups (cuffs in
American English) on modern trouser hems, were standard, with two
buttons on the cuff.

Another rare feature was the use of decorative braiding around the
sleeve cuffs and lapel edges.

#### Accessories

![](Duke_of_Connaught_Vanity_Fair_17_June_1876.jpg "fig:Duke_of_Connaught_Vanity_Fair_17_June_1876.jpg")
in a braided frock coat suit with silk [top hat](top_hat "wikilink"),
stand-up collar, [cravat](cravat "wikilink"), buttonhole, striped shirt,
gloves, [button boots](button_boots "wikilink"),
[cane](Walking_stick "wikilink") and racing glasses, in a cartoon in
*[Vanity Fair](Vanity_Fair_(UK_magazine) "wikilink")* from 1876.\]\]

Proper accessories to wear with the frock coat included a
non-collapsible [top hat](top_hat "wikilink") and a
[boutonnière](boutonnière "wikilink") in the lapel. A
[Homburg](Homburg_(hat) "wikilink") hat was considered too informal to
wear with proper formal morning dress. During the Victorian and
Edwardian era, [button boots](dress_boot "wikilink") with a single row
of punching across the cap toe were worn along with a
[cane](Walking_stick "wikilink"). On cold days, it was common to wear a
[frock overcoat](overfrock "wikilink"), a type of
[overcoat](overcoat "wikilink") cut exactly the same as the frock coat,
with the waist seam construction, only a little longer and fuller to
permit it to be worn over the top of the frock coat. Patent leather
[dress boots](dress_boot "wikilink") were worn up until the Edwardian
era with morning dress. The practice of wearing patent leather shoes is
today reserved strictly for evening [formalwear](formalwear "wikilink").
Trousers are uncuffed and worn with braces to avoid the top of the
trousers from showing underneath the [waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink").
Only white shirts were worn with frock coats. The shirt was worn with a
standing [detachable collar](detachable_collar "wikilink") with either
wingtips or "imperial" style (plain standing). The most standard
neckwear was a formal [cravat](cravat "wikilink") . The cravat was tied
in the Ascot knot characterised by way the ends cross over in front or
alternatively in a Ruche knot, tied like a
[four-in-hand](four-in-hand "wikilink") knot of a modern
[necktie](necktie "wikilink"). A decorative [cravat
pin](cravat_pin "wikilink") often adorned with a precious stone or pearl
was used to keep the cravat tidy. The cravat was usual with a frock coat
when worn in more formal occasions through the Victorian and Edwardian
eras, although the long necktie came to be worn increasingly after the
turn of the century in the same manner as it is today with [morning
dress](morning_dress "wikilink"). The practice of wearing [bow
ties](bow_tie "wikilink") as an acceptable alternative with formalwear
fell away after the late Victorian to early [Edwardian
era](Edwardian_era "wikilink") and became relegated to eveningwear, as
remains the case in the 21st century. As with a formal shirt for white
tie, [cuffs](cuff "wikilink") were single (rather than double) cuffed
and made to close with [cufflinks](cufflinks "wikilink"). The
[waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink") was usually
[double-breasted](double-breasted "wikilink") with peaked
[lapels](lapel "wikilink"). Formal gloves in light grey
[suede](suede "wikilink"), [chamois](chamois "wikilink") or [kid
leather](kidskin "wikilink") were also required.

### Informal frock coat suits

![](Frockcoatsuit_informal_check.jpg "fig:Frockcoatsuit_informal_check.jpg").
The foreparts are connected by a chain link.\]\] The solid black garment
described above was widely used but before the [lounge
suit](lounge_suit "wikilink") became popular, there was a need for a
more informal garment for smart casual wear. A version of the frock coat
was used here too, with matching trousers and a more informal cloth,
featuring stripes or the check shown in the plate opposite. The
waistcoat, instead of being black as usual in the formal version, was
matching or odd. Until the modern cut away [morning
coat](morning_coat "wikilink") was worn, the single breasted frock coat
was called a [morning coat](morning_coat "wikilink") and was used in
such a less formal context and double breasted coats made this way would
often not fasten, being held loosely together in much the same way the
modern morning coat is, with a single link.[9]

The accessories for the two styles depended on the intended use of the
coat: for more formal settings, the outfit might still have striped
trousers and demand a top hat and white gloves; for business, by the
turn of the century, the morning coat was used (again, this referred to
a single breasted frock coat then, not the modern morning coat). This
last was accompanied by a business collar (such as winged collar, not a
standing Imperial collar); a four in hand tie (as opposed to the formal
cravat and puff) and a soft [Derby](Derby_(hat) "wikilink") or
[Homburg](Homburg_(hat) "wikilink").[10]

## Modern use

### General

Although ceased as a protocol-regulated required formal attire at the
[British royal court](British_royal_court "wikilink") in 1936 at the
order of the short-reigning King [Edward VIII](Edward_VIII "wikilink"),
the frock coat - embodying the background for all contemporary civil
formal wear - has not altogether vanished.

The [state
funeral](Death_and_state_funeral_of_Winston_Churchill "wikilink") of
[Winston Churchill](Winston_Churchill "wikilink") in 1965 included
bearers of frock coats.[11]

[Savile Row](Savile_Row "wikilink") [tailor](tailor "wikilink") and
reinnovator [Tommy Nutter](Tommy_Nutter "wikilink") (1943– 1992) was a
frequent wearer.

On a further note, frock coats, albeit often in other colours than
black, survive until this day recurringly in uniforms of [hotel
staff](hotel_staff "wikilink").

To this day, King [Tupou VI](Tupou_VI "wikilink") of
[Tonga](Tonga "wikilink") (born 1959) has been a frequent wearer of
frock coats.

As an example of more recent fashion, [Prada](Prada "wikilink")'s autumn
editions of 2012 heavily embraced frock coats.

Some wedding [grooms](groom "wikilink") apply more or less creative
civil or military variants of frock coats. In the civilian wear cases it
is sometimes accompanied by the same creativity in terms of [ascot
ties](ascot_tie "wikilink"). As a prominent example, when [Prince
Harry](Prince_Harry "wikilink") married [Meghan
Markle](Meghan_Markle "wikilink") in 2018, he and his brother and best
man [Prince William](Prince_William "wikilink") opted for military [full
dress uniform](full_dress_uniform "wikilink") variants of frock coats.

### Military uniforms

![](Peter_Wall_GB.jpg "fig:Peter_Wall_GB.jpg") general wearing a frock
coat in 2012.\]\] The cut of a frock coat with a waist seam flatters a
man's figure, as opposed to a [sack coat](suit_(clothes) "wikilink") and
such frock coats remained part of some 21st-century [military
uniforms](military_uniform "wikilink"). They can either be
[single-breasted](single-breasted "wikilink") as in army uniforms or
[double-breasted](double-breasted "wikilink") as in navy uniforms. An
example of the latter is seen in the modern gala dress of officers in
the Spanish Navy.[12] The [British Army](British_Army "wikilink")
currently retains the frock coat for [ceremonial
wear](Uniforms_of_the_British_Army#Frock_coats "wikilink") by senior
officers of
[Lieutenant-General](Lieutenant-general_(United_Kingdom) "wikilink")
rank and above, by officers of the [Household
Division](Household_Division "wikilink"), by some bandmasters and by
holders of certain Royal appointments.[13]

### Orthodox Jewish wear

In the [Lithuanian](Litvish "wikilink") [yeshiva](yeshiva "wikilink")
world, many prominent figures wear a black frock coat also known as a
[kapotteh](kapotteh "wikilink") (accompanied by either a
[Homburg](Homburg_(hat) "wikilink") or [fedora
hat](fedora_hat "wikilink")) as formal wear. In recent years many
[Sefardi](Sefardi "wikilink") rabbis also wear a similar frock coat. The
frock coat amongst non-Hassidic Jews is usually reserved for a [rosh
yeshiva](rosh_yeshiva "wikilink"), (maybe also the
[mashgiach](mashgiach_ruchani "wikilink") and other senior rabbis of the
yeshiva) and other rabbis such as important communal rabbis and some
chief rabbis.

Most married male [Lubavitcher](Lubavitch "wikilink") Hasidim also don
frock coats on [Shabbat](Shabbat "wikilink"). All Hasidim also wear a
[gartel](gartel "wikilink") (belt) over their outer coats during prayer
services.

Most [Hasidim](Hasidic_Judaism "wikilink") wear long coats called
[rekelekh](rekel "wikilink") during the week, which are often mistaken
for frock coats but are really very long
[suit](suit_(clothing) "wikilink") jackets. On Shabbat, Hasidim wear
[bekishes](bekishe "wikilink"), which are usually silk or polyester as
opposed to the woollen frock coat. The [bekishe](bekishe "wikilink") and
the [rekel](rekel "wikilink") both lack the waist seam construction of
the frock coat. Additionally, bekishes can be distinguished from frock
coats by the additional two buttons on front and a lack of a slit in the
back.

Part of the slit hem in the back of the frock coat is rounded so as to
not require [tzitzit](tzitzit "wikilink"). The buttons are usually made
to go right over left on most Jewish frock coats, particularly those
worn by Hasidic Jews.

In Yiddish, a frock coat is known as a *frak*, a *sirtuk* or a
*kapotteh*.

### Teddy Boys

The [Teddy Boys](Teddy_Boy "wikilink"), a 1950s UK youth movement, named
for their use of Edwardian-inspired clothing, briefly revived the frock
coat, which they often referred to as a "drape".
