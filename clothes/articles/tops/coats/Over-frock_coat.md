in an over-frock coat, by [Mathew Brady](Mathew_Brady "wikilink").\]\]
An **over-frock coat** is a [formal](formal_wear "wikilink")
[overcoat](overcoat "wikilink") designed to be worn over a [frock
coat](frock_coat "wikilink") if needed in cold weather. A **top-frock
coat** may also be worn over a frock coat in milder weather. Shaped like
the body coats popular in the late [Victorian](Victorian_era "wikilink")
and [Edwardian periods](Edwardian_period "wikilink"), the over-frock
coat was cut in essentially the same way as the frock coat that was worn
under it, although it would be larger overall to accommodate the
frock-coat worn underneath. Like the frock coat, the over-frock would
typically be single-breasted, with [step
lapels](jacket_lapel "wikilink") for
[informal](Informal_attire "wikilink") occasions like business, and
double-breasted with pointed lapels for formal occasions -
[weddings](wedding "wikilink"), [funerals](funeral "wikilink"),
[balls](ball "wikilink"), etc. The formal variety was sometimes called a
*Prince Albert overcoat*. A frock-overcoat, like a frock coat, almost
never has pockets.

## Description

Both the top-frock and over-frock coats were [woollen](wool "wikilink"),
like most male garments of the time, and were made in varying weights,
ranging from just 14oz for mild-weather topcoats, to 20 or 30oz for
really cold weather. Wool was not a prerequisite, but was the most
common material, and came in a range of qualities, the finest being that
of a [Merino sheep](Merino_sheep "wikilink"). Any material might be
used, at a greater cost, including [cashmere](Cashmere_wool "wikilink")
(from the [Kashmir goat](Kashmir_goat "wikilink")),
[angora](angora_wool "wikilink") (from the [Angora
rabbit](Angora_rabbit "wikilink")), [alpaca](alpaca "wikilink"), or
[huarizo](huarizo "wikilink") (from a hybrid of alpaca and llama).
Evening over-frock coats, worn over [Evening
dress](White_tie "wikilink") could be made from
[Mohair](Mohair "wikilink") (from the [Angora
goat](Angora_goat "wikilink")), which produced an additional sheen.
Evening over-frocks often have silk [revers](jacket_lapel "wikilink"),
like the dress coat worn underneath. Both could be lined on the inside
with [fur](fur_clothing "wikilink") of animals ranging from
[nutria](Muskrat "wikilink") or [rabbit](rabbit "wikilink") to [silver
fox](Domesticated_silver_fox "wikilink") or [Imperial
sable](Sable "wikilink"), depending on the owner's means and
preferences. To order coat lined in [sable](sable "wikilink"),
[beaver](beaver "wikilink"), [seal](Pinniped "wikilink"), or
[mink](mink "wikilink") from one's tailor would be prohibitively
expensive for most, and to own one would mark one as a person of immense
wealth and status. The collars were very often
[velvet](velvet "wikilink") for warmth. [Silk
velvet](Silk_velvet "wikilink") was most expensive, while velvets made
from cotton or other materials were more affordable.

## History

![](W_Curtis_Noyes.jpg "fig:W_Curtis_Noyes.jpg") (1805-1864) wearing a
single-breasted overfrock with velvet collar and pointed lapels.\]\] The
over-frock was the standard overcoat for much of the Victorian era and
until after the [First World War](First_World_War "wikilink"). Its
popularity mirrored the [frock coat](frock_coat "wikilink"), which
replaced the [tailcoat](tailcoat "wikilink")
([justacorps](justacorps "wikilink")) as day wear in the 1850s. The
frock coat, often attributed to the result of the fashion influence of
the [Regency](British_Regency "wikilink") dandy [George Bryan 'Beau'
Brummell](Beau_Brummell "wikilink"), was almost universally black, and
was worn with [waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink") and trousers, which
could be of any colour. Black coat, waistcoat, and trousers - "frock
suits" - were worn only for funerals (as a '[mourning
suit](Mourning "wikilink")') and the most
[formal](formal_wear "wikilink") of occasions. The trousers that went
with it - what would be known as [formal
trousers](formal_trousers "wikilink") - could either be checked or
striped, or have no pattern at all. The frock coat, and with it the
over-frock, was increasingly rarely worn as [casual
wear](casual_wear "wikilink") towards the end of the 19th century, as
the "[sack suit](sack_suit "wikilink")", the comparatively loose modern
suit was adopted for [leisure wear](leisure_wear "wikilink"), and the
[morning coat](morning_coat "wikilink"), originally for
[equestrian](Equestrianism "wikilink") use, replaced it for some formal
events. By 1926, when King [George V](George_V "wikilink") wore a
morning coat to the opening of the [Chelsea flower
show](Chelsea_flower_show "wikilink"), the frock coat was barely ever
worn, and with it the over-frock. In 1936 King [Edward
VIII](Edward_VIII "wikilink") removed it from official [British royal
court](British_royal_court "wikilink") [dress
codes](dress_code "wikilink").

The over-frock, like other body coats, could not survive the increasing
cost of the [bespoke tailoring](bespoke "wikilink") required to make
them fit properly around the waist to create the classical "hour-glass"
silhouette. In the first decades of the 20th century, it was replaced by
sack overcoats like the [Chesterfield
coat](Chesterfield_coat "wikilink"), the [guard's
coat](guard's_coat "wikilink"), and the [Ulster
coat](Ulster_coat "wikilink") and the [Inverness
coats](Inverness_coat "wikilink") and such, mirroring the change from
frock coats to modern suit jackets. The expensive over-frock became
impractical in comparison.
