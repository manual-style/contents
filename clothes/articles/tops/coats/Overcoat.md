An **overcoat** is a type of long [coat](coat_(clothing) "wikilink")
intended to be worn as the outermost garment, which usually extends
below the knee. Overcoats are most commonly used in
[winter](winter "wikilink") when warmth is more important.

They are sometimes confused with or referred to as **topcoats**, which
are shorter and end at or above the knees. Topcoats and overcoats
together are known as **outercoats**. Unlike overcoats, topcoats are
usually made from lighter weight cloth such as
[gabardine](gabardine "wikilink") or covert, while overcoats are made
from heavier cloth or [fur](fur "wikilink").

## History

In many countries, coats and gowns reaching below the knee have been
worn for centuries, often for [formal](formal_wear "wikilink") uses,
establishing either social status or as part of a professional or
[military uniform](military_uniform "wikilink"). In the 17th century,
the overcoat became widely stylized and available to the different
classes.

In the [Western world](Western_world "wikilink"), the general profile of
overcoats has remained largely unchanged for a long time. During the
[Regency](Regency_era "wikilink"), the fashion was to have very
form-fitting clothes, with sidebodies, waist seams, and a flared skirt.
Examples of this included the [frock
overcoat](frock_overcoat "wikilink") and [paletot](paletot "wikilink").

### Chesterfield coat

![](Major-General_The_Hon._James_MacDonald_large.jpg "fig:Major-General_The_Hon._James_MacDonald_large.jpg")
[Chesterfield coat](Chesterfield_coat "wikilink") with [top
hat](top_hat "wikilink") (1876).\]\] The over-frock coat gradually
shifted to the looser styles more common now, typified by the
[Chesterfield coat](Chesterfield_coat "wikilink"), which became popular
by the end of the [Victorian](Victorian_fashion "wikilink") period.
Until then, most coats were double-breasted, but Chesterfields and
accompanying styles like the [guard's coat](guard's_coat "wikilink")
were worn in both single- and double-breasted varieties.

More recently, there is a decline in the wearing of full-length
overcoats, and double-breasted ones are much less common.

### Greatcoat

mounted, campaigning in [France](France "wikilink") in 1814, wearing a
grey overcoat, by [Jean-Louis-Ernest
Meissonier](Jean-Louis-Ernest_Meissonier "wikilink").\]\] Overcoats in
various forms have been used by militaries since at least the late 18th
century, and were especially associated with winter campaigns, such as
[Napoleon's Russian campaign](Napoleon's_Russian_campaign "wikilink").
The full-length overcoat was once again popularised by the use during
[World War I](World_War_I "wikilink") of the [trench
coat](trench_coat "wikilink").

Stereotypically, overcoats used by the army tended to be
[single-breasted](single-breasted "wikilink"), while navies often used
[double-breasted](double-breasted "wikilink") overcoats. Overcoats
continued to be used as [battle dress](battle_dress "wikilink") until
the mid-1940s and 1950s, when they were deemed impractical. However, in
colder countries, such as the former [Soviet
Union](Soviet_Union "wikilink"), they continue to be issued and used.
When more efficient clothing and [synthetic
fibres](synthetic_fibre "wikilink") became readily available, the
overcoat began to be phased out even there.
