A **parka** or **anorak** is a type of
[coat](coat_(clothing) "wikilink") with a
[hood](hood_(headgear) "wikilink"), often
[lined](lining_(sewing) "wikilink") with [fur](fur "wikilink") or [faux
fur](Fake_fur "wikilink"). The [Caribou Inuit](Caribou_Inuit "wikilink")
invented this kind of garment, originally made from
[caribou](Reindeer "wikilink") or [seal](pinniped "wikilink") skin, for
[hunting](hunting "wikilink") and [kayaking](kayaking "wikilink") in the
frigid [Arctic](Arctic "wikilink"). Some Inuit anoraks require regular
coating with [fish oil](fish_oil "wikilink") to retain their water
resistance.

The words *anorak* and *parka* have been used interchangeably, but they
are somewhat different garments. Strictly speaking, an anorak is a
waterproof, hooded, pull-over jacket without a front opening, and
sometimes [drawstrings](drawstring "wikilink") at the waist and cuffs,
and a parka is a hip-length cold-weather coat, typically stuffed with
[down](down_feather "wikilink") or very warm [synthetic
fiber](synthetic_fiber "wikilink"), and with a fur-lined hood.

## Etymology

The word *anorak* comes from the
[Greenlandic](Greenlandic_language "wikilink") (*Kalaallisut*) word
*annoraaq*. It did not appear in English until 1924; an early definition
is "a beaded item worn by Greenland women or brides in the 1930s". In
the early 1950s it was made from [nylon](nylon "wikilink"), but changed
to [poplin](poplin "wikilink") by 1959, when it was featured in
*[Vogue](Vogue_(magazine) "wikilink")* magazine as a fashion item. In
1984, *[The Observer](The_Observer "wikilink")* used the term to refer
to the type of people who wore it and subsequently, in the United
Kingdom, it is sometimes used as a mildly [derogatory
term](Anorak_(slang) "wikilink").[1]

The word *parka* is derived from the
[Nenets](Nenets_languages "wikilink") language.[2] In the [Aleutian
Islands](Aleutian_Islands "wikilink") the word simply means "animal
skin".[3] It first entered the English written record in a 1625 work by
[Samuel Purchas](Samuel_Purchas "wikilink").

The [Inuit](Inuit "wikilink") who speak
[Inuktitut](Inuktitut "wikilink") use parkas and have various terms
related to them as follows:

Inuktitut terminology[4]

## Amauti

##  N-3B ("scrub snorkel" or "snorkel") parka

<img src="Snorkel_parka.jpg" title="fig:Snorkel_parka.jpg" width="175" alt="Snorkel_parka.jpg" />
The original **snorkel parka** ([USAF](USAF "wikilink") N-3B parka,
which is 3/4 length and has a full, attached hood; the similar N-2B
parka is waist-length and has an attached split hood) was developed in
the United States during the early 1950s for military use, mainly for
flight crews stationed in extremely cold areas. It was designed for use
in areas with temperatures as low as . Originally made with a sage green
[DuPont](DuPont "wikilink") flight silk [nylon](nylon "wikilink") outer
and lining it was padded with a wool [blanket](blanket "wikilink") type
material until the mid-1970s when the padding was changed to
[polyester](polyester "wikilink") wadding making the jacket both lighter
and warmer. The outer shell material also was changed to a sage green
cotton-nylon blend, with respective percentages 80–20, 65–35, and 50–50
being used at various times.

It gained the common name of "snorkel parka" because the hood can be
zipped right up leaving only a small tunnel (or snorkel) for the wearer
to look out of. This is particularly effective in very cold, windy
weather although it has the added liabilities of seriously limiting the
field of vision and hearing. Earlier Vietnam-era hoods had genuine fur
ruffs; later versions used synthetic furs. Original manufacturers of
this parka for the government included Skyline, Southern Athletic,
Lancer, Greenbrier, Workroom For Designers, Alpha, and Avirex.

The basic N-3B parka design was copied and sold to the civilian market
by many manufacturers with varying degrees of quality and faithfulness
to the original government specifications. Surplus military parkas are
often available for relatively low prices online and in [surplus
stores](surplus_stores "wikilink"); they compare quite favorably with
civilian extreme-cold parkas of all types due to their robust
construction, designed for combat conditions, and warmth.

The 1970s–1980s civilian version of the parka was made in many colors –
navy blue, green, brown, black, maroon, grey, royal blue, sky blue and
bright orange. Most had an orange diamond quilted nylon lining, although
a very small number did have alternative colored linings such as yellow,
pale blue, and green. While still manufacturing parkas to the military
standard, Alpha Industries have more recently adopted the orange lining
and a slimmer fit when producing their VF59 model parka which is now
more popular than the military version.

In the late 1980s the snorkel parka came to be associated in the UK with
[trainspotters](trainspotter "wikilink"), who would supposedly wear
them, giving birth to the slang term there
*[anorak](anorak_(slang) "wikilink")*.

In Europe the snorkel parka started to regain popularity in the late
1990s and early 2000s.

## Fishtail parka

![](Fishtail_Parka.jpg "fig:Fishtail_Parka.jpg").\]\]
![](Oasis_sunderland.jpg "fig:Oasis_sunderland.jpg") (left) of Britpop
band [Oasis](Oasis_(band) "wikilink") wearing a fishtail parka at a
concert in 2009.\]\] The **fishtail parka** was first used by the
[United States Army](United_States_Army "wikilink") in 1950 during the
[Korean War](Korean_War "wikilink"). Following the end of the Second
World War the US army recognized the need for a new cold weather combat
system, resulting in four main styles of fishtail parka: the EX-48,
M-48, M-51 and the M-65. The M stands for military, and the number is
the year it was standardized. The EX-48 model was the first prototype or
"experimental" precursor to all of them. The M-48 then being the first
actual production model fishtail parka after the pattern being
standardized on December 24, 1948.

The name *fishtail* comes from the fish tail extension at the back that
could be folded up between the legs, much like a
[Knochensack](Uniforms_and_insignia_of_the_Luftwaffe#Knochensack "wikilink"),
and fixed using snap connectors to add wind-proofing. The fishtail was
fixed at the front for warmth or folded away at the back to improve
freedom of movement when needed.

The EX-48 parka is distinctive as it has a left sleeve pocket and is
made of thin poplin, only the later production M-48 parkas are made of
the heavier sateen canvas type cotton. The EX-48 also has a thin fibre
glass based liner that is very light and warm, the M-48 has a thicker
wool pile liner with an integral hood liner made of wool. Both are
distinguishable from any other type of parka by having the sleeve
pocket. This was dropped for the M-51 onward. The fur ruff on the hood
is also fixed to the shell of an EX-48/M-48 and is of wolf, coyote or
often wolverine. The M-48 parka was costly to produce and therefore only
in production for around one year. The pockets were wool lined both
inside and out. The cuffs had two buttons for securing tightly around a
wearer's wrist. The later more mass-produced M-51 parka had just the one
cuff button. The liner had a built in chest pocket which again was
unique to the M-48 parka.

The next revision was the M-51, made because the M48 was too expensive
to mass-produce.

The outer hood of the M-51 Fishtail Parka is integral to the parka
shell, an added hood liner as well as a button in main liner make the
M-51 a versatile 3 piece parka. The idea behind this 3 part system was
to enable a more customisable parka that allowed for easier cleaning of
the shell as the hood fur was on the detachable hood liner, not fixed to
the shell as in the M-48. It also allowed for both liners to be buttoned
in or our depending on the temperature and hence warmth required. It was
also cheaper than the M-48 to mass-produce The early M-51 was made of
heavy sateen cotton, the same material as the M-48. Later revisions of
the M-51 were poplin based. The later liners were also revised from the
"heavy when wet" wool pile to a lighter woolen loop or frieze wool
design that dried easier and were far lighter. The frieze liners were
constructed of mohair and were designed using a double loop system which
repelled cold weather.

The M-65 fishtail parka has a detachable hood and was the last revision.
It features a removable quilted liner made of light nylon / polyester
batting which are modern synthetic materials. The M-65 fishtail parka
first came into production in 1968. These parkas featured synthetic fur
on the hoods after an outcry from the fur lobby. As a result, only hoods
for these parkas made in 1972 and for one year later have real fur.

Designed primarily for combat arms forces such as infantry, they are to
be worn over other layers of clothing; alone, the fishtail parka is
insufficient to protect against "dry cold" conditions (i.e. below about
-10 °C). As such all fishtail parkas are big as they were designed to be
worn over battle dress and other layers.

In the 1960s UK, the fishtail parka became a symbol of the
[mod](mod_(subculture) "wikilink") [subculture](subculture "wikilink").
Because of their practicality, cheapness and availability from [military
surplus](military_surplus "wikilink") shops, the parka was seen as the
ideal garment for fending off the elements and protecting smarter
clothes underneath from grease and dirt when on the mod's vehicle of
choice, the [scooter](scooter_(motorcycle) "wikilink"). Its place in
popular culture was assured by newspaper pictures of parka-clad mods
during the [Bank Holiday riots](Mods_and_Rockers "wikilink") of the
1960s.

## Cagoule

A cagoule is the [British English](British_English "wikilink") term for
a lightweight, weatherproof anorak or parka, usually unlined and
sometimes knee-length.[5] A cagoule could be rolled up into a very
compact package and carried in a bag or pocket. It was invented by Noel
Bibby of [Peter Storm Ltd](Peter_Storm_(clothing) "wikilink"). in the
early 1960s.[6] It may have a full-zippered front opening, or pull over
the head like an original anorak and close with snaps or a short zipper,
has an integral hood, and elasticated or drawstring cuffs. In some
versions, when rolled up, the hood doubles as a bag into which the rest
of the coat is pushed. It became very popular in the United Kingdom
during the 1970s.
