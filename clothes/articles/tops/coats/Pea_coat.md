A **pea coat** (or **peacoat**, **pea jacket**, **pilot jacket**,
**reefer jacket**) is an outer coat, generally of a
[navy-coloured](Navy_blue "wikilink") heavy [wool](wool "wikilink"),[1]
originally worn by [sailors](sailor "wikilink") of European and later
[American](United_States "wikilink") [navies](navy "wikilink").[2] Pea
coats are characterized by short length, broad
[lapels](Jacket_lapel "wikilink"),
[double-breasted](double-breasted "wikilink") fronts, often large
wooden, metal or plastic buttons, and vertical or slash pockets.[3]
References to the pea jacket appear in American newspapers at least as
early as the 1720s,[4] and modern renditions still maintain the original
design and composition.[5]

A *bridge coat* is a pea coat that extends to the
[thighs](thighs "wikilink"), and is a uniform exclusively for
[officers](Officer_(armed_forces) "wikilink") and [chief petty
officers](chief_petty_officer "wikilink"). The *reefer jacket* is for
officers[6] and chief petty officers only, and is identical to the basic
design but usually has gold buttons and
[epaulettes](epaulettes "wikilink"). Only officers wear the
epaulettes.[7]

## Characteristics

Today the style is considered a classic, and pea coats are now worn by
all manner of individuals. The style has evolved to the addition of
hoods.

A few of the jackets seen on the street are genuine navy surplus; being
a classic garment, it is frequently available from retailers, though
often with small design changes that reflect the current fashion trends.
The standard for historical pea coats was wool, most often made of heavy
[Melton cloth](Melton_Mowbray#Melton_cloth "wikilink") through the 1970s
in the U.S. Navy. Presently coats are made from wool. While pea coats
are offered in many colors by retailers, the [US
Navy](US_Navy "wikilink")-issue pea coat is dark blue.[8]

of Poland](1939_Invasion_of_Poland "wikilink").\]\] A black leather
version of the reefer jacket was worn by
[Kriegsmarine](Kriegsmarine "wikilink") [U-Boat](U-Boat "wikilink")
officers during [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), including
[Admiral Dönitz](Karl_Dönitz "wikilink").[9] It was also worn with a
[peaked cap](peaked_cap "wikilink") by [Red Army](Red_Army "wikilink")
[commissars](commissar "wikilink"),[10] tank commanders and pilots.[11]
[Christopher Eccleston](Christopher_Eccleston "wikilink") wore an
identical coat when portraying [The Doctor](Ninth_Doctor "wikilink"), as
did [Paul McGann](Paul_McGann "wikilink") when portraying
[him](Eighth_Doctor "wikilink") on the audio series [Dark
Eyes](Dark_Eyes_(audio_drama_series) "wikilink").[12]

## Etymology

According to a 1975 edition of the *[Mariner's
Mirror](Mariner's_Mirror "wikilink")*, the term *pea coat* originated
from the [Dutch](Dutch_language "wikilink") or [West
Frisian](West_Frisian_language "wikilink") word *pijjekker* or
*pijjakker*, in which *pij* referred to the type of cloth used, a coarse
kind of [twilled](twill "wikilink") blue cloth with a
[nap](Nap_(textile) "wikilink") on one side. ’’Jakker’’ designates a
man’s short, heavy, coat.[13]

Another theory, favoured by the [US Navy](US_Navy "wikilink"), is that
the heavy [topcoat](Overcoat "wikilink") worn in cold, miserable weather
by seafaring men was once tailored from "pilot cloth" – a heavy, coarse,
stout kind of twilled blue cloth with the nap on one side. This was
sometimes called P-cloth from the initial letter of
[pilot](Maritime_pilot "wikilink"), and the garment made from it was
called a P-jacket – later a pea coat. The term has been used since 1723
to denote coats made from that cloth.[14]
