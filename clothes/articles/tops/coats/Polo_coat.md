A **polo coat**, also known as a **camel coat**, is a men's
[overcoat](overcoat "wikilink") associated with [polo](polo "wikilink")
players in [England](England "wikilink").
[Camelhair](Camelhair "wikilink") was the fabric at first, but later
camelhair and [wool](wool "wikilink") blends became standard due to its
higher durability.[1] The terms polo coat and camel coat are thus
synonymous.

Polo coats are not to be confused with [Polo Ralph
Lauren](Polo_Ralph_Lauren "wikilink") and were not invented by [Ralph
Lauren](Ralph_Lauren "wikilink").[2] The polo coat was originally a wrap
coat with a belt, but eventually adopted a double-breasted with buttons
configuration.[3]
