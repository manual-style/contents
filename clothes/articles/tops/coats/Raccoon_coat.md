in a raccoon coat with a [bowler hat](bowler_hat "wikilink") (likely
1930s).\]\] **Raccoon coats**, full-length [fur
coats](Fur_clothing "wikilink") made of [raccoon](raccoon "wikilink")
hide, were a [fad](fads_and_trends "wikilink") in the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") during the 1920s. Such coats were
particularly popular with male college students in the middle and later
years of the decade.[1] They became popular due to the stories of [Davy
Crockett](Davy_Crockett "wikilink") and popular artist [James Van Der
Zee](James_Van_Der_Zee "wikilink").[2] [George Olsen and His
Music](George_Olsen "wikilink") released a recording highlighting the
fad in 1928, titled "Doin' the Raccoon", with the lyrics:

> <poem>From every college campus comes the cheer: oy-yoy! The season
> for the raccoon coat is here, my boy! Rough guys, tough guys, men of
> dignity, Join the raccoon coat fraternity, soon, To do the
> raccoon!</poem>

A few months after Olsen's recording hit the air, the November 16, 1929,
issue of *[The Saturday Evening
Post](The_Saturday_Evening_Post "wikilink")* featured an Alan Foster
illustration of several college men wearing raccoon coats.[3] The
raccoon coat (many times accompanied with a [straw
boater](straw_boater "wikilink"), [wingtip spectator
oxfords](Spectator_shoe "wikilink"), and either a
[saxophone](saxophone "wikilink") or a [ukulele](ukulele "wikilink"))
has been referenced numerous times in movies and television, both as a
symbol of the [Jazz Age](Jazz_Age "wikilink") and as a cliché motif of
collegiate enthusiasm.

The fad saw a resurgence during the mid-1950s, specifically vintage
coats from the 1920s.[4][5]
