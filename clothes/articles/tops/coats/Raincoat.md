![](Yellow_Raincoat.jpg "fig:Yellow_Raincoat.jpg") A **raincoat** or
**slicker** is a [waterproof or
water-resistant](Waterproofing "wikilink")
[coat](Coat_(clothing) "wikilink") worn to protect the body from
[rain](rain "wikilink"). The term **rain jacket** is sometimes used to
refer to raincoats that are waist length. A rain jacket may be combined
with a pair of **rain pants** to make a **rain suit**.

Modern raincoats are often constructed of breathable, waterproof fabrics
such as [Gore-Tex](Gore-Tex "wikilink") or [Tyvek](Tyvek "wikilink") and
coated [nylons](nylon "wikilink"). These fabrics allow some air to pass
through, allowing the garment to 'breathe' so that sweat vapour can
escape. The amount of pouring rain a raincoat can handle is sometimes
measured in the unit [millimetres, water
gauge](millimeters,_water_gauge "wikilink").

## History

The first modern waterproof raincoat was created following the patent by
Scottish chemist [Charles Macintosh](Charles_Macintosh "wikilink") in
1824 of new [tarpaulin](tarpaulin "wikilink") fabric, described by him
as "India rubber cloth," and made by sandwiching a core of rubber
softened by [naphtha](naphtha "wikilink") in two pieces of fabric.[1][2]
