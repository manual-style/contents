A **shadbelly** ([North American
English](North_American_English "wikilink")) is a type of [riding
coat](riding_coat "wikilink") worn in certain
[equestrian](Equestrianism "wikilink") situations by [fox
hunting](fox_hunting "wikilink") members,
[dressage](dressage "wikilink") riders, [eventers](eventing "wikilink")
(in the dressage phase of the higher levels), and occasionally by other
[hunt seat](hunt_seat "wikilink") riders. Shadbellies are also standard
attire for the [show hack](show_hack "wikilink") classes at certain
breed shows in the [United States](United_States "wikilink") and
[Canada](Canada "wikilink").

This coat is considered an element of very formal riding attire, and its
use is therefore reserved for the most formal forms of equestrianism.
When used in the classic hunt, they should not be worn by youth riders,
despite any trend or availability.

## Terminology

The shadbelly coat is part of a [formal wear](formal_wear "wikilink")
category known as the [tailcoat](tailcoat "wikilink"). The male version
of the shadbelly is sometimes called a "weaselbelly."

The [compound word](English_compound "wikilink") "shadbelly" was also
once spelled "shad belly", and the coat is also sometimes referred to as
a "swallowtail." Essentially, the [space between the original two-word
spellings has been removed](Compound_(linguistics) "wikilink"), but not
their meanings.

The word "[tuxedo](tuxedo "wikilink")" in [American
English](American_English "wikilink") includes the shadbelly or
swallowtail coat as well as what would be termed a [dinner
jacket](dinner_jacket "wikilink") in [British
English](British_English "wikilink"). Today, "swallowtail" and
"shadbelly" are used interchangeably for [fox
hunting](fox_hunting "wikilink") in the United States, but "shadbelly"
is the primary term used in various horse show disciplines.

## History

The design is historically linked to the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink"), where the famous
[dandy](dandy "wikilink") and trendsetter [Beau
Brummel](Beau_Brummel "wikilink") popularized the style for daywear
during the [Regency period](Regency_period "wikilink"). By the 1860s the
formal [tailcoat](tailcoat "wikilink") was used almost exclusively for
formal evening wear. [European](Europe "wikilink")
[royalty](Royal_family "wikilink") wore the coat for formal occasions
and [portraits](portraits "wikilink") as well as for riding horseback.
The [Amish](Amish "wikilink") and [Quakers](Quakers "wikilink") wore the
shadbelly to church functions.

The earliest recorded use of a shadbelly-type coat is in [early
Christianity](early_Christianity "wikilink"), when [Chaldean
Christian](Chaldean_Christian "wikilink") priests wore coats
representing the body of a [fish](Fish_in_culture "wikilink").

## Description

A shadbelly is usually black in color, although navy is becoming
popular, and deep green is also occasionally seen in some nations. It
has tails, double buttons, and either is worn over a
[vest](vest "wikilink") (British English: waistcoat) of canary yellow
or, particularly when worn in hot weather, has false yellow points
peeking out under the cut-away front, to simulate the look of a vest.
Vests or vest points of colours other than canary yellow are becoming
more popular. Generally a white shirt with a [ratcatcher
collar](Ratcatcher_(attire) "wikilink") and tied [stock
tie](stock_tie "wikilink") (a type of simple
[cravat](cravat "wikilink")) is standard.

Traditionally, a shadbelly is worn with a [top hat](top_hat "wikilink"),
white [breeches](breeches "wikilink") and black [riding
boots](riding_boots "wikilink"). In recent years, some governing
organizations have required that riders wear approved safety helmets
instead of traditional hats and caps[1]. Ideally white gloves should
also be worn for a fully correct turnout, although many riders will wear
black gloves while showing to make undesirable hand posture less
conspicuous.

In the hunter ring, shadbellies have shorter, unweighted tails, compared
to the long-weighted dressage tails.
