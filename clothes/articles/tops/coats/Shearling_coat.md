**Shearling coats** are made from processed
[lambskin](Lambskin_(sheepskin) "wikilink"),
[sheepskin](sheepskin "wikilink"), or [pelt](Fur "wikilink"). This
"[shearing](sheep_shearing "wikilink")" process creates a uniform depth
of the [wool](wool "wikilink") fibers for a uniform feel and look.
Shearling [coats](coat_(clothing) "wikilink") and
[garments](garment "wikilink") are made from pelts by
[tanning](Tanning_(leather) "wikilink") them with the wool of uniform
depth still on them. The result is a soft, natural
[fleece](Wool "wikilink") material that is heavy due to thickness of
outer skin and degree of fur on the inside, which is quite dense. The
length of the sheep fur can be fairly long, but it is typically cropped
short to about two inches or five centimeters. Most find these coats to
be extremely comfortable and warm. Due to the high quality and
uniqueness of shearling, coats and garment are considered luxurious.
Sheepskin and Shearling are synonymous. The outer must be sheepskin to
be Shearling on the inside.
