A **sport coat**, also called a **sport jacket** (**sports coat** or
**sports jacket** in [American English](American_English "wikilink")),
is a [men](men "wikilink")'s [lounge jacket](lounge_jacket "wikilink")
designed to be worn on its own without matching
[trousers](trousers "wikilink"), traditionally for sporting purposes.
Styles, fabrics, colours and patterns are more varied than in most
suits; sturdier and thicker fabrics are commonly used, such as
[corduroy](corduroy "wikilink"), [suede](suede "wikilink"),
[denim](denim "wikilink"), [leather](leather "wikilink"), and
[tweed](Tweed_(cloth) "wikilink").

Originally, sports coats were worn as appropriate attire for
participating in certain outdoor sports. With time, they were adopted by
those attending such events, and came to be used on more formal
occasions, sometimes being used in [school
uniforms](school_uniform "wikilink").

## Types

A [shooting jacket](shooting_jacket "wikilink") is a type of sport coat
worn, as the name suggests, originally while participating in the sports
of shooting or hunting. It usually comes with a leather patch on the
front shoulder to prevent recoil wear from the butt of a shotgun or
rifle, and frequently has matching leather patches on the elbows[1].

A hacking jacket is a [wool](wool "wikilink") sports coat for casual
[horseback riding](horseback_riding "wikilink"), often of
[tweed](Tweed_(cloth) "wikilink") and traditionally 3 buttoned with a
single [vent](Vent_(tailoring) "wikilink").

A [blazer](blazer "wikilink") is similar to a sports coat, typically
tailored from solid color or striped fabrics. Blazers are often made
with metal buttons reflecting their origins in the [British
Navy](British_Navy "wikilink") and the sport of
[boating](boating "wikilink"), though this is not necessarily a defining
feature. Blazers also often have [patch
pockets](Pocket#Types "wikilink"), unlike other kinds of coats.[2]

The jacket is mentioned in the title of the 1957 [rock and
roll](rock_and_roll "wikilink") hit single "[A White Sport Coat (and a
Pink Carnation)](A_White_Sport_Coat "wikilink")" by [Marty
Robbins](Marty_Robbins "wikilink"); the title was later adapted by
[Jimmy Buffett](Jimmy_Buffett "wikilink") for his 1973 album *[A White
Sport Coat and a Pink
Crustacean](A_White_Sport_Coat_and_a_Pink_Crustacean "wikilink")*.[3]
