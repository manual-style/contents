A **tailcoat** is a knee-length [coat](coat_(clothing) "wikilink") with
the front of the skirt cut away, so as to leave only the rear section of
the skirt, known as the *tails*.

The tailcoat shares its historical origins in clothes cut for convenient
[horse riding](horse_riding "wikilink") in the [Early Modern
era](Early_Modern_era "wikilink"). Ever since the 18th century, however,
tailcoats evolved into general forms of day and evening [formal
wear](formal_wear "wikilink"), in parallel to how the [lounge
suit](lounge_suit "wikilink") succeeded the [frock
coat](frock_coat "wikilink") (19th century) and the
[justacorps](justacorps "wikilink") (18th century).

Thus, in 21st-century [Western dress
codes](Western_dress_code "wikilink") for men, mainly two types of
tailcoats have survived:

1.  **[Dress coat](Tailcoat#Dress_coat "wikilink")**, an evening wear
    with a squarely cut away front, worn for formal [white
    tie](white_tie "wikilink")
2.  **[Morning coat](Tailcoat#Morning_coat "wikilink")** (or *cutaway*
    in [American English](American_English "wikilink")), a day wear with
    a gradually tapered front cut away, worn for formal [morning
    dress](morning_dress "wikilink")

In [colloquial language](colloquial_language "wikilink") without further
specification, "tailcoat" typically designates the former, that is the
evening (1) dress coat for white tie.

### Shadbelly

In [equestrianism](equestrianism "wikilink"), a variant called a
shadbelly is still worn in certain disciplines in its eighteenth-century
role as daytime formalwear. It is basically a form of dress coat which
is closer in cut to the early nineteenth-century style worn by [Beau
Brummel](Beau_Brummel "wikilink") than to the modern version worn with
evening formal dress. The male version of the shadbelly is often called
a "weaselbelly".

### Levée dress coat

This is a type of dress coat traditionally worn with [court
dress](court_dress "wikilink"), until the mid-twentieth century. It was
made of black velvet and traditionally worn at court,
[levées](Levee_(ceremony) "wikilink"), and evening state parties by
those who did not wear uniforms. A version made of black
[barathea](barathea "wikilink") was also worn as [diplomatic
dress](Diplomatic_uniform "wikilink").

It was single breasted with a stand-up collar, with plain gauntlet
cuffs, and two three-pointed flap pockets on the waist seam. It had six
metal buttons at the front, and two decorative buttons at the back. The
body of the coat was lined with black silk, and skirts with white silk.
It was worn with breeches, black silk hose, white bow tie, white gloves,
and court shoes (pumps) with steel buckles. The front of the coat was
cut away squarely like a standard dress coat.[1]

### Military coatee

![](Charles_Lennox,_4th_Duke_of_Richmond,_engraving_after_John_Kay,_1789.jpg "fig:Charles_Lennox,_4th_Duke_of_Richmond,_engraving_after_John_Kay,_1789.jpg")
From c. 1790 until after the [Crimean War](Crimean_War "wikilink"), a
red tail coat with short tails, known as a coatee, was part of the
infantry uniform of the [British army](British_army "wikilink"). The
collar and cuffs were in the regimental colors and the coats had white
braid on the front.[2] Elite light infantry units like the 95th Rifles
were issued short green coats to provide camouflage and ease of
movement.

The Americans issued a similar uniform in dark blue to enlisted men
during the [War of 1812](War_of_1812 "wikilink"). This remained in
service until 1833 when it was replaced with a [shell
jacket](shell_jacket "wikilink").[3] Officers continued to wear tail
coats until after the [Mexican War](Mexican–American_War "wikilink")
when [frock coats](frock_coat "wikilink") became the standard field
wear. By the time the [M1858 uniform](M1858_uniform "wikilink") was
introduced tail coats had been relegated to full dress.

The [Royal Navy](Royal_Navy "wikilink") had an elaborate hierarchy of
tailcoats for the officers, allowing further buttons and gilding
according to rank and seniority. These were single-breasted for junior
officers and double-breasted for those with the rank of lieutenant and
above.

### Highland coatee

This is worn with Highland dress, and has a square cut away front like a
dress coat, but the tails are cut significantly shorter.

### Footman's coat

This was worn as livery, a servant's uniform. It was knee length with a
sloped cut-away front like a morning coat. It was single breasted with a
stand-up collar and gilt buttons. There were three pronged side pockets
similar in style to the levée dress coat.

## Dress coat

![](Spy_Delacouur.jpg "fig:Spy_Delacouur.jpg") (19th century) wearing
dress coat with [top hat](top_hat "wikilink") for [white
tie](white_tie "wikilink").\]\] A **dress coat**, sometimes called a
**swallow-tail** or **claw-hammer** coat, is the coat that has, since
the 1850s, come to be worn only in the evening by men as part of the
[white tie](white_tie "wikilink") [dress
code](dress_code_(Western) "wikilink"), also known as evening [full
dress](full_dress "wikilink"), for [formal](formal_attire "wikilink")
evening occasions. It is commonly referred to as just a *tailcoat*, but
amongst tailors (both British and American) and dress historians it is
traditionally called a **dress coat** to differentiate it from other
types of tailcoats.

The modern dress coat is an evolution of the coat that was once both day
and evening dress. It became increasingly popular from around the late
1790s and was particularly widespread during the [British
Regency](British_Regency "wikilink"), and in America in the 1830s to
1850s.[4] The eighteenth-century dress coat was supplanted in the 1850s
as formal day wear by the [frock coat](frock_coat "wikilink"), which was
in turn replaced in the twentieth century by the [morning
coat](morning_coat "wikilink"). In the Regency period, the dress coat
with gilt buttons was always worn with non-matching trousers, pantaloons
or breeches. Since the Victorian era, the modern dress coat for evening
wear has been worn with matching trousers of the same cloth with two
stripes of braiding down the side. The resulting suit is traditionally
referred to by tailors as a *dress suit*.

A dress coat is waist length in the front and sides, and has two long
tails reaching to the knees in back. Sometimes there is a pocket on the
inside to hold [gloves](gloves "wikilink"). Since around the 1840s the
dress coat has lacked outside side pockets, but prior to this it took
flapped side pockets. Since the early twentieth century, it has become
acceptable to have a welted pocket on the outside of the chest to hold a
pocket square, but prior to this dress coats lacked any outer pockets.
The front of the skirt is squarely cut away. Since around the 1830s the
coat has been constructed with a waist seam that allows greater waist
suppression. From the [Victorian era](Victorian_era "wikilink"), the
[revers](revers "wikilink") has taken facings in silk
([grosgrain](grosgrain "wikilink") or [satin](satin "wikilink")) on the
[lapels](lapel "wikilink"). Although it is double-breasted, since the
1870s, the dress coat no longer fastens in the front.[5] As a result,
although there are two rows of buttons, these are all non-functional,
serving only a decorative function.

As part of modern [white tie](white_tie "wikilink"), either a black or
midnight blue dress coat is worn with a stiff detachable white
wing-collar [dress shirt](dress_shirt "wikilink"), with a plain starched
pique bib, and [single cuffs](single_cuff "wikilink") fastened with
[cufflinks](cufflink "wikilink"); a matching white marcella cotton
[bowtie](bowtie "wikilink") and white [waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink");
black trousers; and black [patent leather](patent_leather "wikilink")
[pumps](court_shoe "wikilink") with stockings. Additionally, a top hat,
silk dress scarf, and white dress gloves are also seen as acceptable.

## Morning coat

![](1929wedding.jpg "fig:1929wedding.jpg") A morning coat is a
single-breasted coat, with the front parts usually meeting at one button
in the middle, and curving away gradually into a pair of tails behind,
topped by two ornamental buttons on the waist seam. The lapels are
usually [pointed](jacket_lapel "wikilink") (American English peak), not
[step](jacket_lapel "wikilink") (notch), since the coat is now only worn
as formalwear. When it was first introduced, the step lapel was common,
since it was worn as half dress. The coat can be grey or black as part
of [morning dress](morning_dress "wikilink"), and is usually worn with
striped, or very occasionally checked, trousers.

The morning coat may also be worn as part of a morning suit, which is
mid-grey with matching trousers and waistcoat.

The modern **morning coat** (or **cutaway** in American English) is a
man's coat worn as the principal item in [morning
dress](morning_dress "wikilink"). The name derives from morning
nineteenth-century [horseback riding](equestrianism "wikilink") exercise
for gentlemen. It was regarded as an informal form of [half
dress](half_dress "wikilink"). Gradually it became acceptable as an
alternative to the [frock coat](frock_coat "wikilink") for formal day
wear or full dress. Since the nineteenth century it is normally only
seen at weddings, at formal baptisms, and in England and Australia, at
races such as [Royal Ascot](Royal_Ascot "wikilink"), [the
Derby](Epsom_Derby "wikilink") and the [Victoria
Derby](Victoria_Derby "wikilink") where it is worn with a contrasting
waistcoat, usually light grey or sometimes 'fancy'. It is very
occasionally seen at funerals but more often it is used as day wear at
formal luncheons, especially civic occasions under formal gowns, when
worn with a black matching waistcoat (or 'vest'). Male members of the
[cabinet of Japan](cabinet_of_Japan "wikilink") wear it in their first
public appearance following the formation of the cabinet.

The Marshal and Clerk of the [United States Supreme
Court](United_States_Supreme_Court "wikilink") wear morning coats when
the justices are appearing in public wearing their traditional robes,
for example when the court is in session, or when attending the
[President's](President_of_the_United_States "wikilink") [State of the
Union address](State_of_the_Union_address "wikilink"). At one time all
attorneys appearing before the court wore morning coats but they now
wear standard business attire. The [United States Solicitor
General](United_States_Solicitor_General "wikilink") (when the office is
held by a male) and his or her male deputies continue the tradition of
wearing morning dress when arguing before the court.[6]

During the Victorian and Edwardian era, in the United States *morning
coat* referred to a single-breasted [frock coat](frock_coat "wikilink"),
so the British then made fun of the fact that Americans were unable to
distinguish between morning coats and frock coats. In modern American
English, morning coats are referred to as *cutaway coats*.
