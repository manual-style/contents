trenchcoat (2018).\]\] A **trench coat** or **trenchcoat** is a coat
variety made of [waterproof](waterproof "wikilink") heavy-duty
[cotton](cotton "wikilink") [gabardine](gabardine "wikilink")
[drill](drill_(fabric) "wikilink"), [leather](leather "wikilink"), or
[poplin](poplin "wikilink").[1] It generally has a removable
[insulated](Thermal_insulation "wikilink")
[lining](lining_(sewing) "wikilink"), [raglan
sleeves](raglan_sleeves "wikilink"), and the classic versions come in
various lengths ranging from just above the ankles (the longest) to
above the knee (the shortest).[2] It was originally an item of clothing
for Army officers (developed before the war but adapted for use in the
[trenches](Trench#Military_engineering "wikilink") of the [First World
War](First_World_War "wikilink"), hence its name) and shows this
influence in its styling.

Traditionally this garment is
[double-breasted](double-breasted "wikilink") with 10 front buttons, and
has wide lapels, a storm flap, and pockets that button-close.[3] The
coat is belted at the waist with a self-belt, as well as has straps
around the wrists that also buckle (to keep water from running down the
forearm when using binoculars in the rain). The coat often has shoulder
straps that button-close; those were a functional feature in a military
context. The traditional color of a trench coat was
[khaki](khaki "wikilink"), although newer versions come in many colors.

## History

### World War I

![](WWITrenchcoat.jpeg "fig:WWITrenchcoat.jpeg") officer in the First
World War.\]\]

The trench coat was developed as an alternative to the heavy
[serge](serge_(fabric) "wikilink") [greatcoats](greatcoat "wikilink")
worn by [British](United_Kingdom "wikilink") and
[French](France "wikilink") soldiers in the [First World
War](First_World_War "wikilink"). Invention of the trench coat is
claimed by two British luxury clothing manufacturers,
[Burberry](Burberry "wikilink") and [Aquascutum](Aquascutum "wikilink"),
with Aquascutum's claim dating back to the 1850s. [Thomas
Burberry](Thomas_Burberry "wikilink") invented
[gabardine](gabardine "wikilink") fabric in 1879 and submitted a design
for an Army officer's raincoat to the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink") [War Office](War_Office "wikilink")
in 1901.[4][5][6][7]

The trench coat became an optional item of dress in the British Army,
and was obtained by private purchase by officers and Warrant Officers
Class I who were under no obligation to own them.[8] No other ranks were
permitted to wear them. Another optional item was the British Warm, a
wool coat similar to the greatcoat that was shorter in length, also worn
by British officers and Warrant Officers Class I as an optional piece.

![](Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-21752-0005,_VEB_Leipziger_Bekleidungswerke,_preiswerte_Trenchcoats.jpg "fig:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-21752-0005,_VEB_Leipziger_Bekleidungswerke,_preiswerte_Trenchcoats.jpg"),
1953.\]\] During the First World War, the design of the trench coat was
modified to include [shoulder straps](shoulder_strap "wikilink") and
[D-rings](D-ring "wikilink"). The shoulder straps were for the
attachment of epaulettes or other rank insignia; the D-ring was
originally used for attaching map cases, swords, or other equipment to
the belt, and there is a popular myth that it was for the attachment of
hand grenades.

This latter design was dubbed "trench coat" by the soldiers in the front
line. Many trench coats had large pockets for maps, and cleverly placed
flaps and vents to deal with the odour associated with earlier rubber
coats.

A range of waterproof coats was designed and sold during wartime that
incorporated War Office requirements with traditional aspects of
leisurewear. What became known as the "trench coat" combined the
features of a military waterproof cape and the regulation greatcoat
designed for British officers.[9] Many [veterans](veteran "wikilink")
returning to civilian life kept the coats, which became fashionable for
both men and women.

### World War II

During the [Second World War](Second_World_War "wikilink"), officers of
the [United Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink") continued to use the
trench coat on the battlefield in inclement weather. Other nations also
developed trench coat style jackets, notably the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") and the [Soviet
Union](Soviet_Union "wikilink"), and other armies of continental Europe
such as [Belgium](Belgium "wikilink"),
[France](French_Third_Republic "wikilink"),
[Germany](Nazi_Germany "wikilink"),
[Greece](Kingdom_of_Greece "wikilink"), the
[Netherlands](Netherlands "wikilink"),
[Poland](Second_Polish_Republic "wikilink") (and are often seen in war
zone photographs in the 1939-40 era, even worn by troops on the attack),
although as the war progressed, in the field shorter "field jackets"
became more popular, including garments such as the [Denison
smock](Denison_smock "wikilink") used by
[British](United_Kingdom "wikilink") [commandos](commando "wikilink"),
[paratroopers](paratrooper "wikilink"), and [snipers](sniper "wikilink")
and the
[M1941](M-1941_Field_Jacket "wikilink")/[M1943](U.S._Army_M-1943_Uniform "wikilink")
field jackets used by the [US Army](United_States_Army "wikilink").
These garments were shorter and more practical than the trench coat, and
as such they allowed the wearer to be more mobile.[10]

A typical trench coat is a 10-buttoned, double-breasted long coat made
with beige, black, khaki, or tan fabric. Trench coats often have cuff
straps, [raglan sleeves](raglan_sleeve "wikilink"), [shoulder
straps](shoulder_strap "wikilink"), and a belt. The trench coat was
typically worn as a [windbreaker](windbreaker "wikilink") or as a rain
jacket, and not for protection from the cold in winter or snowy
conditions (although many come with removable wool liners for additional
warmth, they are usually not as warm as an overcoat). Period
advertisements from World War I reveal that the trench coat was sized to
wear over the British Warm, to offer water protection when the
temperature was cold enough to require the heavier coat, which explains
the traditionally generous sizing of trench coats; however, makers in
recent years have resized trench coats downwards to conform more closely
to overcoat sizing, as the two coats, trench and overcoat, would rarely
if at all be worn together today. [11]

### Later

![](Trenchcoat_worn_by_President_Gerald_R._Ford.jpg "fig:Trenchcoat_worn_by_President_Gerald_R._Ford.jpg")
in public after two assassination attempts in 1975\]\] Trench coats have
remained fashionable in the decades following [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink"). Their original role as part of an army
officer's uniform lent the trench coat a businesslike respectability,
although many prefer to tie the belt in front (rather than use the
buckle) to project a more casual look than strict military dress.
[Humphrey Bogart](Humphrey_Bogart "wikilink")'s [Rick
Blaine](Rick_Blaine "wikilink") from
*[Casablanca](Casablanca_(film) "wikilink")*[12] and [Peter
Sellers](Peter_Sellers "wikilink")' [Inspector
Clouseau](Inspector_Clouseau "wikilink") wore the trench coat in the
public eye. Often, a [fedora](fedora "wikilink") or an
[ushanka](ushanka "wikilink") (during colder weather) was also worn. In
the 1960s, radical intellectuals wore trench coats over black
[turtleneck sweaters](turtleneck_sweater "wikilink"), while some
[Mods](Mod_(subculture) "wikilink") wore trench coats as fashionable
overcoats, as an alternative to the [fishtail
parka](fishtail_parka "wikilink") or
[crombie](crombie_(clothing) "wikilink").
[Streakers](streaking "wikilink") and
[flashers](Exhibitionism "wikilink") often prefer trench coats since
they conceal the wearer's lack of undergarments and can be opened
quickly when the exhibitionist is ready to expose him or herself.

While similar, the [heavy metal](Heavy_metal_fashion "wikilink") and
[Goth fashion](Goth_fashion "wikilink") trend of black oilcloth
[dusters](Duster_(clothing) "wikilink") are usually (incorrectly)
referred to as trench coats.[13] Early media reports of the 1999
[Columbine High School
massacre](Columbine_High_School_massacre "wikilink") initially
associated the perpetrators ([Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold](Eric_Harris_and_Dylan_Klebold "wikilink")) with members of the
"[Trenchcoat Mafia](Trenchcoat_Mafia "wikilink")", a group of outcasts
who allegedly wore conspicuous black Australian oilcloth dusters. In the
copycat [W. R. Myers High School
shooting](W._R._Myers_High_School_shooting "wikilink") days later, it
was rumored the shooter had worn a trench coat. In the wake of these
incidents, many public schools in the US forbade students from wearing
trench coats, both because of their cultural associations and on the
grounds that they could be used to conceal weapons.[14][15]
