The **Ulster** is a [Victorian](Victorian_era "wikilink") working
daytime [overcoat](overcoat "wikilink"), with a [cape](cape "wikilink")
and sleeves. It is often seen in [period
productions](historical_period_drama "wikilink") of Victorian novels,
such as those of [Charles Dickens](Charles_Dickens "wikilink") and [Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle](Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle "wikilink"). The Ulster coat
was referred to in Doyle's [Sherlock Holmes](Sherlock_Holmes "wikilink")
stories *[A Study in Scarlet](A_Study_in_Scarlet "wikilink")*, *[The
Sign of the Four](The_Sign_of_the_Four "wikilink")*, "[A Scandal in
Bohemia](A_Scandal_in_Bohemia "wikilink")", "[The Adventure of the Blue
Carbuncle](The_Adventure_of_the_Blue_Carbuncle "wikilink")" and "[The
Adventure of the Noble
Bachelor](The_Adventure_of_the_Noble_Bachelor "wikilink")".

The Ulster is distinguished from the
[Inverness](Inverness_coat "wikilink") by the length of the cape; in the
Ulster, this cape only reaches the elbows, allowing free movement of the
forearms. It was commonly worn by coachmen who would be seated outdoors
in bad weather for long periods, but needed to use their arms to hold
reins.

Often made of hard-wearing fabrics, such as
[herringbones](herringbone_(cloth) "wikilink") or tweeds, it was not a
formal coat at the time, though in the 20th century a cape would be seen
as such. After the [Edwardian](Edwardian_era "wikilink") period, it lost
its cape, and continued to be used as a heavy-duty overcoat, often in a
[double-breasted](double-breasted "wikilink") style.

A lightweight version of this coat is called an **ulsterette**.[1]

In the 2015 Broadway musical *[Hamilton](Hamilton_(musical) "wikilink")*
the lead characters of [Aaron Burr](Aaron_Burr "wikilink") and
[Alexander Hamilton](Alexander_Hamilton "wikilink") (as portrayed by
[Leslie Odom, Jr.](Leslie_Odom,_Jr. "wikilink") and [Lin-Manuel
Miranda](Lin-Manuel_Miranda "wikilink") respectively) are seen wearing
Ulster coats in the final duel in the song *[The World Was Wide
Enough](The_World_Was_Wide_Enough "wikilink")* [2].
