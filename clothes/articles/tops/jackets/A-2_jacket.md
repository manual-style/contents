The **Type A-2 leather flight jacket** is an American military flight
jacket originally invented and developed for and closely associated with
[World War II](World_War_II "wikilink") [U.S. Army Air
Forces](U.S._Army_Air_Forces "wikilink") [pilots](Aviator "wikilink"),
navigators and bombardiers, who often decorated their jackets with
[squadron patches](Embroidered_patch "wikilink") and elaborate artwork
painted on the back. Sometimes casually referred to as a [bomber
jacket](bomber_jacket "wikilink"), its original designation was "Jacket,
Pilot's (summer)", and its wartime usage was limited neither to pilots
nor to bomber crews.

## History

The Type A-2 flying jacket was adopted as standard issue by the [U.S.
Army Air Corps](U.S._Army_Air_Corps "wikilink") as the successor to the
Type A-1 flying jacket on May 9, 1931, per specification number 94-3040.

![](457th_Bombardment_Group_-_B-17_Flying_Fortress_-_Crew.Rose_Olive.jpg "457th_Bombardment_Group_-_B-17_Flying_Fortress_-_Crew.Rose_Olive.jpg")

The U.S. Army Air Forces Class 13 Catalog listed the garment as "Jacket,
Flying, Type A-2". It describes the jacket's construction as "seal brown
[horsehide](horsehide "wikilink") leather, knitted wristlets and
waistband (skirt)." Broadly similar in construction to the A-1, it
replaced the A-1's buttoned front and pocket flaps with a
[zipper](zipper "wikilink") and hidden snap fasteners (although the
first three A-2 contracts retained the pocket buttons). The A-1's
stand-up knitted collar, which buttoned closed, was supplanted in the
A-2 by a shirt-style leather collar, with hidden snaps at the points and
a hook-and-eye latch at the throat. Stitched-down shoulder straps were
also added to the design. Sizes were listed as ranging in even numbers
from 32 through 54.

The A-2 was replaced by the AN6552 (AN-J-3) per a specification 94-3040
reference document dated May 24, 1943 and declared "Limited Standard",
meaning replacements were available. The April 1944 USAAF catalog for
ordering supplies does not list the AN-J-3 as an option, but both the
A-1 and A-2 are listed (the A-1 for $4.00 and the A-2 for $8.12). The
lack of AN-J-3 replacements may explain why three U.S. A-2 contracts
were granted in Dec. 1943, or after the A-2 jacket was officially
replaced. (The lack of AN-J-3 replacements may also explain why flying
jackets were purchased in Australia by the Department of the U.S. Army
in June 1943. These "V505" jackets have been shown to be used by some
members of the U.S. Fifth Air Force.)

(*Note: A primary source of information on flying/pilot jackets was a
single summary post-WWII "Type Designation Sheet" (TDS) until the A-2
specification 94-3040 documentation was declassified and published by an
anonymous Vintage Leather Jacket forum member in 2017. **The TDS was
found to have a few errors, so references using the TDS as an
information source contain those same errors.** For example, the A-1
drawing number is AN-6501 and not 074737, the A-2 drawing number is
30-1415 and not 31-1415, the A-2 were manufactured only with a cotton
and not spun silk lining, and so on.*) [1]

## Design and construction

Although the actual design would vary slightly depending on the
manufacturer, and even among contracts within a single manufacturer, all
A-2 jackets had several distinguishing characteristics: a snap-flap
patch pocket on either side that does not have hand warmer compartments
(hands in pockets were considered unfit for a military bearing), a
shirt-style snap-down collar, shoulder straps (or
[Epaulets](Epaulets "wikilink")), knit cuffs and waistband, a back
constructed from a single piece of leather to limit stress on the
garment, and a cotton inner [lining](lining_(sewing) "wikilink") with a
leather hang strap (not a loop) and military spec tag attached just
below the back collar.

Prior to World War II the collar was sewn to a neckband or "stand" like
those found in dress shirts, a time-intensive operation. Wartime
contracts generally had "simple attached" collars, sewn directly to the
back panel and rolled over, although Rough Wear and Perry continued
using the collar stand throughout. Similarly, most pre-war (and some
wartime) A-2s had inset sleeves, attached at a better attitude for body
movement. This too was time-intensive and gave way to "flat attached"
sleeves whose bottom seams met up with the body side seams.

A-2s were initially constructed of horsehide,[2] which was either
[vegetable-](Tanning_(leather)#Vegetable_tanning "wikilink") or
[chrome-tanned](Tanning_(leather)#Chrome_tanning "wikilink"). Some later
A-2's were made from [goatskin](Goatskin_(material) "wikilink") (as was
the [Navy G-1 jacket](G-1_military_flight_jacket "wikilink")) and others
from [cowhide](cowhide "wikilink") (which can be very difficult to tell
from horse if tanned identically). All Spiewak and Doniger jackets are
of goat, as are many Cable, Dubow, Bronco, Perry, and Rough Wear
examples.

Wartime-issued A-2 jackets appear in a wide range of color tones and
hues, although all are based on two distinct colors: Seal (dark brown to
almost black) and russet (pale red-brown to medium brown). Most lighter
russet jackets were darker seal re-dyed during the war to cover scuffing
and discoloration although some contracts, like the Aero Leather 21996,
were dyed seal right from the start. Original knit cuffing typically
matched the leather or came close, but exceptions exist, such as Aero
Leather's eye-catching rust-red cuffing on seal brown hide.

The A-2 was one of the early articles of clothing designed expressly to
use a [zipper](zipper "wikilink"). Zippers were made of steel or
[brass](brass "wikilink"), and some were [nickel](nickel "wikilink")
plated. Known zipper suppliers were Talon, Crown, Conmar, and Kwik, with
Talon providing the majority of zippers used in wartime A-2
construction. Until about 1940, Talon zippers with riveted or grommeted
metal bottoms were used.

Unlike modern, loose-fitting jackets, the original A-2 looks to us today
a rather trim-fitting jacket. Period photos and films reveal a jacket
which could be worn fitted and sharp looking or a bit baggy and loose in
the body. It was designed to fit the thinner male of the time- original
A-2 jackets worn by modern men may seem a bit snug in the shoulders.
This is particularly true of pre-war contract garments such as the 1933
Werber and the 1938 and 1940 Aero Leathers. Period photos and films show
that the A-2 was typically worn over a shirt, or a shirt and flight
suit; airmen were more likely to switch to a sheep-lined jacket or,
later, an electrified flight suit for wintertime or high-altitude
operations.

## Manufacturers

![](First_three_(3)_A-2_Flying_Jacket_Contracts.jpg "First_three_(3)_A-2_Flying_Jacket_Contracts.jpg")

There were many manufacturers of A-2 jackets during the 1930s and 1940s
whose product showed a wide range of quality, workmanship, and fit
characteristics. All contracts used a cotton lining, though various
replacements were made over the years. The first three (3) contracts had
button pocket flaps, while all the rest were snapped pockets beginning
with Werber order number 33-1729. Manufacturers included civilian
clothing producers such as David D. Doniger & Co., makers of the popular
MacGregor brand outerwear, as well as leather-goods companies like J.A.
Dubow Mfg., whose chief peacetime product was [baseball
mitts](baseball_mitt "wikilink"). Rough Wear manufactured the A-2 under
several different contracts, each varying slightly in color and
style.[3]

"Limited Standard" (AN-J-3, drawing AN-6552 has officially replaced the
A-2)

## Wartime use

The A-2 jacket was awarded to an [Army Air
Forces](Army_Air_Forces "wikilink") officer upon completion of basic
flight training, and always before graduating to advanced training. No
standard system of distribution was used, though generally airmen lined
up in front of boxes containing jackets of various sizes and given the
appropriate size jacket by the base
[quartermaster](quartermaster "wikilink"). A-2s were exclusive to
commissioned officers until early in World War II, when also issued to
enlisted aircrews.

The A-2 was a treasured item to the airman and was worn with as much
pride as his wings. As airmen progressed through various duty stations
they often added and removed squadron patches, rank marks, and
occasionally elaborate artwork depicting the type of aircraft they flew
or a copy of the artwork painted on their airplane. Bomber crews often
added small bombs to the right front of their jackets indicating the
number of missions they had flown. As a result, many jackets ended up
with numerous stitch marks as patches of various sizes were removed and
replaced when the owner changed units. Unlike Navy aviators, who often
wore the patches of every squadron they had ever flown with, AAF
personnel could only display the patch of their current assignment. The
emblem of the Army Air Forces was often sewn, painted, or applied by
decal on the left shoulder, while the shield of the specific Air Force
(5th, 8th, etc.) was often displayed on the right.

![](303rd_Bombardment_Group_Boeing_B-17F_Flying_Fortress_41-24582.jpg "303rd_Bombardment_Group_Boeing_B-17F_Flying_Fortress_41-24582.jpg")

Despite the A-2's becoming a symbol of the American pilot, in 1943
General [H. H. "Hap" Arnold](Henry_H._Arnold "wikilink") canceled any
further leather jacket contracts in favor of newer cloth-shell jackets
like the B-10 and B-15. Needless to say, Arnold's popularity with his
airmen was not improved by his decision. Even after the transition to
cloth, existing units could still order replacement A-2s, keeping
production going well into 1944. And it was impossible to prevent airmen
from continuing to obtain and wear the style – as demonstrated by the
large number of photos clearly showing Korean War pilots of
[F-82](F-82_Twin_Mustang "wikilink")'s and [F-86](F-86 "wikilink")'s
still wearing the original A-2 issued to them a decade earlier, or newer
jackets made to fit their current sizes.

Fighter pilots, who often had heated cockpits, could wear the A-2 into
combat more easily. Some jackets had a map of the mission area sewn into
the lining, which could be used (in theory) for navigation if shot down.
Some jackets (famously, those from the [China Burma India
Theater](China_Burma_India_Theater "wikilink"), and of the [Flying
Tigers](American_Volunteer_Group "wikilink")) had a "[Blood
chit](Blood_chit "wikilink")" sewn on the lining or outer back, printed
on cloth, which promised certain rewards to civilians who aided a downed
airman. In certain ETO units and possibly elsewhere a prerogative of the
fighter [ace](ace "wikilink") was a red satin lining which was added on
confirmation of his fifth aerial kill.

![](Bud_Tordoff_with_ground_crew_in_front_of_his_P-51,_Upupa_epops.jpg "Bud_Tordoff_with_ground_crew_in_front_of_his_P-51,_Upupa_epops.jpg")

Early wartime pictures show entire bomber crews outfitted with A-2s,
although at altitude in a bomber they probably weren't too useful. The
pilot and copilot had primitive cabin heat on some aircraft and would
wear the A-2, while the rest of the bomber crew usually wore heavier
fleece-lined Type B-3 or ANJ-4 (and later B-9 and B-11 parkas) which
were warmer and better suited to long hours in the severe cold. However,
period photos do show A-2s worn by crew underneath heavy outer garments,
and candid on-base photos often show crewmen of all ranks in A-2s. A
warm and comfortable [mouton](Mouton_fur "wikilink") collar was an
addition authorized in mountainous C-B-I commands.

## Theatre-made jackets

Throughout the War, as the A-2's popularity grew, so too did the demand
for it. Only aircrewmen could obtain A-2 jackets through regular
channels, although a few celebrated nonflying officers like Gens.
[MacArthur](Douglas_MacArthur "wikilink") and
[Patton](George_Patton "wikilink") and Maj. [Glenn
Miller](Glenn_Miller "wikilink") also procured and wore them. A small
"cottage industry" soon appeared, especially in England, to make
A-2-style jackets for GI's (including many
[airborne](Airborne_forces "wikilink") infantry troops) who otherwise
couldn't get one. This was especially true after the Army stopped
purchasing new leather jackets in mid-1943, and disappointed airmen were
sent to war in the less desirable cloth jackets, or were unable to
replace A-2's they had lost or damaged. As a result, some war-era
jackets used by World War II airmen are clearly not true to original AAF
specifications, though this makes them no less historic.

## Survivors

Original wartime issued A-2 jackets are rare but not unavailable. The
value of such originals ranges widely depending on condition, known
history, patches and artwork, and even size. Most originals used a
sizing system considerably smaller than today's comparable sizes, with
only 2- of "slack" over the tagged chest size. In other words, an
original size 42 might be closer to a modern 40 or even a 38, depending
on the manufacturer. Original World War II era jackets sell at auction
for between $800 and $8,000, with wearable examples generally running
$1,000 and up.

The [National Museum of the United States Air
Force](National_Museum_of_the_United_States_Air_Force "wikilink") has a
collection of original A-2 jackets, most donated by the families of Air
Force pilots. No fewer than fifty are on display at any time throughout
the Museum, including many historic jackets such as Brig. Gen. [James
Stewart](James_Stewart "wikilink")'s A-2 (a Rough Wear contract
42-1401), an A-2 from the AVG "[Flying
Tigers](Flying_Tigers "wikilink")," and another worn by one of the few
U.S. pilots to get airborne during the [attack on Pearl
Harbor](attack_on_Pearl_Harbor "wikilink").

## Modern Air Force A-2

With the exception of a very brief period from 1979 to early 1981 the
U.S. Navy never stopped issuing its [G-1 leather flying
jackets](G-1_military_flight_jacket "wikilink") to Navy, Marine, and
Coast Guard flight crews. This meant that an entire generation of Air
Force pilots and flight crews had missed out on an opportunity not lost
to their Naval comrades. Years of effort by U.S. Air Force personnel to
get the A-2 jacket reissued finally succeeded when the Air Force began
issuing them again in 1988, a decision that may have been influenced by
the popularity of the film "[Top Gun](Top_Gun "wikilink")", and the
military apparel it popularized. The first Air Force A-2 contract was
awarded to [Avirex](Avirex "wikilink"), but all subsequent contracts
from 1988 to 1998 were awarded to Neil Cooper USA, now U.S. Wings of
Ohio. The modern Air Force A-2 is authorized for wear by Air Force
aircrews and missileers who have completed their mission
qualifications.[6]

The latest design differs from the original design in several ways: it
is looser-fitting, made only from goatskin, and produced in only a
medium seal brown color (though many older, fitted jackets are still in
use). Unlike the World War II era pilots, modern Air Force pilots are
not permitted to paint their A-2 jackets or disfigure them in any way.
The official explanation for this is that the paint is flammable and
could pose a fire hazard. The goatskin used in today's A-2 is treated
with a special fire retardant chemical. The crewmember's name tag is
mounted on the left breast, with the Major Command, HQ USAF, or
Combatant Command shield are on the right, attached with
[Velcro](Velcro "wikilink"). No patches are permitted to be sewn
directly onto the jacket as they were during World War II.

In 1996 Neil Cooper USA was awarded a contract from the [Defense Supply
Center](Defense_Supply_Center "wikilink"), Philadelphia (DSCP), to
redesign the A-2 jacket to be more functional and to improve the fit.
Side entry pockets were added to the patch pockets and inside wallet
pockets were added. The fit was enlarged via extra pieces under the arms
and on the sides. The neck clasp was also eliminated. These
modifications were previously carried out by the member themselves at
popular places around the world like Pop's Leather in Turkey, or in the
numerous shops in Korea. Now that these modifications are part of the
official issue, only "[Blood Chits](Blood_chit "wikilink")" and other
internal linings are added by the aircrew themselves.

In 1999 Avirex was again awarded a contract to make A-2 jackets. In 2000
they began producing the "21st Century" A-2 using the updated pattern
Neil Cooper USA had designed. In 2006, HQ USAF required all A-2 jackets
to be "[Berry Amendment](Berry_Amendment "wikilink")" compliant. This
means that all materials used in the jacket must be of American origin.
Goat skins used are required to have been born and bred in the U.S., and
the leather tanned in the U.S. (All jackets made by Cooper Sportswear,
and the jackets made by Avirex in 1999, were made of goatskin imported
from [Pakistan](Pakistan "wikilink")).

## Reproductions

Just as a cottage industry appeared during the war to meet the need for
A-2 jackets, so too does such an industry still exist today. Because the
A-2 never went out of style, production of it never really ceased. Over
the years it has varied in style and accuracy relative to the original
war-era design, but it has remained visible in popular movies and TV
shows of the 1950s and 1960s.

In the mid-1970s several small companies catering to purists began
undertaking the job of designing and constructing somewhat authentic
reproductions. Duplicating wartime patterns, often obtained through
"reverse engineering" from dissected originals, but using incorrect
hides that are veg tanned and aniline dyed, originals were chrome tanned
and pigment dyed, all-cotton thread, and even actual the World War
II-era-old stock Talon zippers, they have effectively recreated a
wartime-era jacket that can be worn daily without fear of damaging a
valuable original. Some manufacturers have even gone so far as to
reproduce the particular details of specific World War II A-2 production
contracts. The rarest and most desirable A-2, the Goldsmith 31-1897, has
even been recreated based upon photographic evidence as a survivor has
not been found.

Popularly priced (approximately US $500 and below) A-2 jackets today
only approximate the authentic style, with oversized shoulders and
sleeves intended for layering loose clothing underneath, non-spec hand
and pen pockets, and softer materials like lambskin. A-2s made today by
U.S. Air Force contract manufacturers tend to fit younger, fitter men
with v-shaped torsos, and some former pilots have found that their old
A-2s no longer fit them.

## In the media

A-2 jackets can be seen in many movies, as they came to represent the
American fighting man just as much as the [P-51
Mustang](P-51_Mustang "wikilink") and [Colt
.45](M1911_pistol "wikilink") automatic. Seeing legendary actors such as
[Gregory Peck](Gregory_Peck "wikilink") and [John
Wayne](John_Wayne "wikilink") on the big screen wearing A-2's only
reinforced their popularity. By the 1950s the A-2 was moving into the
role of the [motorcycle](motorcycle "wikilink") jacket, which would soon
evolve into its own distinct style. The jacket worn by [Henry
Winkler](Henry_Winkler "wikilink") in the role of
"[Fonzie](Fonzie "wikilink")" in the TV show *[Happy
Days](Happy_Days "wikilink")* was a variation of the A-2 jacket. In the
1960s and 1970s the A-2 reappeared in a new crop of big budget World War
II films such as *[The Great
Escape](The_Great_Escape_(film) "wikilink")* and
*[Patton](Patton_(film) "wikilink")*, as well as being the wardrobe of
choice for [Bob Crane](Bob_Crane "wikilink")'s character of [Colonel
Hogan](Colonel_Hogan "wikilink") in the popular TV series *[Hogan's
Heroes](Hogan's_Heroes "wikilink")*. This same jacket, manufactured by
the studio's costume department, had previously been worn by [Frank
Sinatra](Frank_Sinatra "wikilink") in the film *[Von Ryan's
Express](Von_Ryan's_Express "wikilink")*. The bomber jacket has made
appearances in non-war films, as well. A teenage [C. Thomas
Howell](C._Thomas_Howell "wikilink") wears a black A-2 for nearly the
entire length of the classic horror film *[The
Hitcher](The_Hitcher_(1986_film) "wikilink")*. [Dwight
Schultz](Dwight_Schultz "wikilink")' character [H. M.
Murdock](H._M._Murdock "wikilink") on 1980s TV show [The
A-Team](The_A-Team "wikilink") wore an A-2 Jacket with a tiger printed
on the back along with the words 'DA NANG 1970'. His character wore the
jacket throughout the show's 5 seasons. Also, in the anime [Hetalia:
Axis Powers](Hetalia:_Axis_Powers "wikilink"), the character America is
most always seen wearing an A-2 jacket with the number '50' on the back
in white. [Arnold Schwarzenegger](Arnold_Schwarzenegger "wikilink") also
appeared an wearing A-2 with police badge in his new 2013 movie *[The
Last Stand](The_Last_Stand_(2013_film) "wikilink")*.

In the 2000s (decade), the A-2 became a popular presidential garment:
both [George W. Bush](George_W._Bush "wikilink") and [Barack
Obama](Barack_Obama "wikilink") have worn them in [photo
ops](photo_op "wikilink") at military installations.
