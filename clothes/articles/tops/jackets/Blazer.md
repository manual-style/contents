A **blazer** is a type of [jacket](jacket "wikilink") resembling a [suit
jacket](suit_jacket "wikilink"), but cut more casually. A blazer is
generally distinguished from a [sport coat](sport_coat "wikilink") as a
more formal garment and tailored from solid colour fabrics. Blazers
often have naval-style metal buttons to reflect their origins as jackets
worn by boating club members.[1]

A blazer's cloth is usually durable, as it is intended as outdoor wear.
Blazers are often part of a [uniform](uniform "wikilink") that denotes,
for example, an airline's employees, pupils of a particular school,
members of sports clubs, or sportsmen and women on a particular team.

## Wearing a blazer

worn at the [Henley Regatta](Henley_Regatta "wikilink"),
[Oxford–Cambridge boat race](The_Boat_Race "wikilink"), and at American
[Ivy League](Ivy_League "wikilink") universities.\]\] Blazers are worn
with a wide variety of other clothes, ranging from a [dress
shirt](dress_shirt "wikilink") and [necktie](necktie "wikilink") to an
open-necked polo shirt, or even just a plain T-shirt. They are seen with
trousers of all colours and [fabrics](textile "wikilink"), from the
classic white cotton or [linen](linen "wikilink"), to grey
[flannel](flannel "wikilink"), to brown or beige
[chinos](chino_cloth "wikilink"), and also [jeans](jeans "wikilink").

A fitted, classically cut, double-breasted navy blue blazer with
navy-style buttons is a popular design and sometimes referred to as a
"reefer" blazer. Particularly in North America and the United Kingdom,
it is now frequently used in [business
casual](business_casual "wikilink") attire.

blazer\]\] Blazers, in a wide range of colours, are worn as part of
[school uniforms](school_uniform "wikilink") by many schools across the
[Commonwealth](Commonwealth_of_Nations "wikilink"), and are still daily
wear for most uniformed pupils in Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
These are blazers in the traditional sense: single-breasted, and often
of bright colours or with [piping](Piping_(sewing) "wikilink"). This
style is also worn by some boat clubs, such as those in
[Cambridge](Cambridge_University "wikilink") or
[Oxford](Oxford_University "wikilink"), with the piped version used only
on special occasions such as a boat club dinner. In this case, the
piping is in [college colours](Oxbridge_scarf_colours "wikilink"), and
college buttons are worn. This traditional style can be seen in many
films set in the Edwardian era, such as *[Kind Hearts and
Coronets](Kind_Hearts_and_Coronets "wikilink")*.

Where the blazer is part of the dress of a school, college, sports club,
or armed service regimental association (veterans' organization), it is
normal for a badge to be sewn to the breast pocket. In schools, this
badge may vary according to the pupil's standing in the school: being a
member of the junior or senior school, being a
[prefect](prefect "wikilink"), or having been awarded colours in
recognition of particular achievement in some academic or sporting
field. In the British Commonwealth, many regimental associations wear
"regimental blazers" which also sport a similar badge on the breast
pocket, usually in the form of a wire badge, and sometimes also
regimental blazer buttons.

In the British army, officers do not normally wear badges on their
blazers (or boating jackets). Two regimental blazers will rarely be the
same, as they are sourced from different civilian suppliers and are not
issued by any authority. This results from the fact that the members of
the association are no longer serving personnel, but civilians, though
still retaining the bond that the badge represents. The standard colour
is navy blue, although in some associations different colours are worn,
such as [rifle green](rifle_green "wikilink") for the associations of
rifle regiments.

Blazers, once commonly worn playing or attending traditional
"gentlemen's sports", persist in only some games now, such as occasional
use by tennis players, or in cricket, where in professional matches,
such as international test matches, it is considered customary for the
captain to wear a blazer with the team's logo or national coat of arms
on the breast pocket – at least during the coin toss at the beginning of
the match.

Two sporting events where blazers signify victory are the Congressional
Cup Regatta at the Long Beach Yacht Club, and the Masters golf
tournament, held in Augusta, Georgia. The former event awards a crimson
blazer to the winner of several flights of match race sailing of the
highest international calibre, while the latter awards a green blazer to
the top Masters golfer in the USA.

## History

The sartorial term *blazer* originated with the red "blazers" of the
[Lady Margaret Boat Club](Lady_Margaret_Boat_Club "wikilink") (1825),
the rowing club of [St. John's College,
Cambridge](St._John's_College,_Cambridge "wikilink"). The Lady Margaret
club jackets were termed *blazers* because of the bright red cloth, and
the term survived the original red coat. A writer to the London *[Daily
News](The_Daily_News_(UK) "wikilink")* (22 August 1889) commented that
"In your article of to-day … you speak of 'a striped red and black
blazer', 'the blazer', also of 'the pale toned' ones … A blazer is the
red flannel boating jacket worn by the Lady Margaret, St. John's
College, Cambridge, Boat Club. When I was at Cambridge it meant that and
nothing else. It seems from your article that a blazer now means a
coloured flannel jacket, whether for cricket, tennis, boating, or
seaside wear."

![](Dress_and_blazer.jpg "fig:Dress_and_blazer.jpg") blazer.\]\] These
early blazers were like later sports jackets, but this term has never
referred to blazers, instead describing jackets derived from the later
innovation of wearing odd jackets for land-based sports. Assertions that
the name is derived from HMS *Blazer* are not borne out by contemporary
sources, although it is reported that before the [standardization of
uniform in the Royal Navy](Royal_Navy_uniform#Ratings "wikilink"), the
crew of HMS *Blazer* wore "striped blue and white jackets",[2]
apparently in response to the sailors of [HMS
*Harlequin*](HMS_Harlequin "wikilink") being turned out in
[harlequin](harlequin "wikilink") suits.[3] As late as 1837 the gig's
crew of HMS *Blazer* were dressed by their Captain in jackets of blue
and white stripes and it is from this that the word *blazer*, meaning a
striped jacket, has entered the language.[4]

The reefer jacket was of naval origin, and described the short
double-breasted jacket worn by sailors in harsh weather, when they
performed duties such as [reefing](reefing "wikilink") the sails. It is
descendants of this which are now commonly described by the term
*blazer*. Originally with black horn buttons, these jackets evolved to
the modern dark blazer, now single as well as double breasted, and with
metallic buttons.

Striped blazers became popular among British
[Mods](Mod_(subculture) "wikilink") in the early 1960s, and again during
the [Mod revival](Mod_revival "wikilink") of the late 1970s –
particularly in three-colour thick/thin stripe combinations, with
three-button single-breasted front, five- or six-inch side or centre
vents, and cuffs with multiple buttons. Various photos from 1964 and
1965 show London mods in boating blazers. Photos of mod icons [The
Who](The_Who "wikilink") from 1964 (as the [High
Numbers](High_Numbers "wikilink")) variously show [Pete
Townshend](Pete_Townshend "wikilink"), [Keith
Moon](Keith_Moon "wikilink") and [John
Entwistle](John_Entwistle "wikilink") wearing boating blazers. Another
mod band, [Small Faces](Small_Faces "wikilink"), and other bands liked
by mods – such as [The Rolling Stones](The_Rolling_Stones "wikilink"),
[The Beatles](The_Beatles "wikilink"), [The
Kinks](The_Kinks "wikilink"), [Georgie Fame and the Blue
Flames](Georgie_Fame_and_the_Blue_Flames "wikilink"), [The
Animals](The_Animals "wikilink"), [The
Yardbirds](The_Yardbirds "wikilink"), The [Moody
Blues](Moody_Blues "wikilink") and [The Troggs](The_Troggs "wikilink") –
had band members wearing striped blazers/boating jackets, or later,
brightly coloured blazers with wide white or other light edging. These
later blazers often had non-metal buttons, sometimes in the same colour
as the edging. The earlier style of striped blazers can be seen in the
film *[Quadrophenia](Quadrophenia_(film) "wikilink")*. The later,
bright, style of blazer was affectionately adopted by [Austin
Powers](Austin_Powers_(character) "wikilink") as part of his
[Swinging-London](Swinging_London "wikilink") look. By the late 2000s
the blazer had been adopted as a popular fashion trend amongst women,
often having shorter lengths, rolled-up sleeves, various lapels and
bright colours.
