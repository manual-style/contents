A **blouson** or **blouse jacket** is a jacket that is drawn tight at
the waist, causing it to blouse out and hang over the waistband. Some of
them have a hood. It takes most of its modern traits from the American
[flight jacket](flight_jacket "wikilink") and police blouson. It is
related to the [Eisenhower jacket](Eisenhower_jacket "wikilink"). It is
considered to be both sportswear and casual civilian clothing.

## History

The [MA-1 bomber jacket](MA-1_bomber_jacket "wikilink") was originally
designed for the US military during the 1950s. The [MA-2 bomber
jacket](MA-2_bomber_jacket "wikilink") has now taken its place.

The *Black jacket* was popularized by [Yves Saint
Laurent](Yves_Saint_Laurent_(designer) "wikilink") and was donned by
some music groups in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Modern [flight
jackets](flight_jacket "wikilink") have been popular with
[skinheads](skinhead "wikilink") and
[scooterboys](scooterboy "wikilink") from the 1980s onwards.

In 1993, the blouson was worn as the national costume of the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") for the [APEC](APEC "wikilink")
meeting held in [Seattle](Seattle "wikilink"),
[Washington](Washington_(U.S._state) "wikilink"). In the early 2000s,
the jacket was popular casual wear in hip hop fashion.

The blouson jacket has been worn by several police departments in the
United States, [Austria](Austria "wikilink"),[2]
[Israel](Israel "wikilink"), [New Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink"),
[Germany](Germany "wikilink") and the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink") due to its sturdy design, and heavy
insulation. The [NYPD](NYPD "wikilink") has used a form of them, since
2010 .[3]
