M.2007.211.3.\]\] A **caraco** is a style of woman's
[jacket](jacket "wikilink") that was fashionable from the mid-18th to
early 19th centuries. Caracos were thigh-length and opened in front,
with tight three-quarter or long [sleeves](sleeve "wikilink"). Like
[gowns of the period](1750–1795_in_fashion "wikilink"), the back of the
caraco could be fitted to the waist or could hang in
[pleats](pleat "wikilink") from the shoulder in the style of a [sack
back](Sack-back_gown "wikilink"). Caracos were generally made of printed
[linen](linen "wikilink") or [cotton](cotton "wikilink").[1][2]

The caraco emerged as an informal style in France in the 1760s,[3] based
on working-class jackets. It was worn with a
[petticoat](petticoat "wikilink") and, if open in front, a
[stomacher](stomacher "wikilink") or decorative
[stays](corset "wikilink"). The English caraco was generally closed in
front. A similar garment with a wrap front, called in English a
[bedgown](bedgown "wikilink") or short gown, was the standard working
woman's costume of the later 18th century.[4]
