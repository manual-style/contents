famous portrait of *ca* 1570 is in doublet and lined and stuffed
("bombasted") [hose](hose_(clothing) "wikilink").\]\] A **doublet**
(derived from the [Ital.](Italian_language "wikilink") *giubbetta*[1])
is a man's snug-fitting [jacket](jacket "wikilink") that is shaped and
fitted to the man's body which was worn in [Spain](Spain "wikilink") and
was spread to [Western Europe](Western_Europe "wikilink") from the late
[Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink") up to the mid-17th century. The
doublet was hip length or waist length and worn over the shirt or
drawers. Until the end of the 15th century, the doublet was usually worn
under another layer of clothing such as a gown, mantle, overtunic or
[jerkin](jerkin_(garment) "wikilink") when in public.

Originally it was a mere stitched and quilted lining ("doubling"), worn
under a [hauberk](hauberk "wikilink") or [cuirass](cuirass "wikilink")
to prevent bruising and chafing. Doublets were sometimes opened to the
waistline in a deep V. The edges might be left free or laced across the
shirt front. If there was space left it might be filled with a
[stomacher](stomacher "wikilink"). By the 1520s, the edges of the
doublet more frequently met at the center front. Then, like many other
originally practical items in the history of men's wear, from the late
15th century onward it became elaborated enough to be seen on its own.

Throughout the 300 years of its use, the doublet served the same
purpose: to give fashionable shape and padding to the body, to support
the hose by providing ties, and to provide warmth to the body. The only
things that changed about the doublet over its history was its style and
cut. It was fashionable until the 1600s.

## History

![](Doubletvanda.jpg "fig:Doubletvanda.jpg") Museum no. 177-1900\]\]

The doublet developed from the padded garments worn under armour, such
as the [gambeson](gambeson "wikilink"), [aketon](aketon "wikilink"), and
[arming doublet](arming_doublet "wikilink").[2]

### 14th and 15th centuries

Doublets of the 14th and 15th centuries were generally hip-length,
sometimes shorter, worn over the [shirt](shirt "wikilink") and
[hose](hose_(clothing) "wikilink"), with a
[houppelande](houppelande "wikilink") or other form of overgown.

From the late 14th century, doublets were cut and padded to give the
wearer an egg-shaped or pigeon-breasted silhouette, a fashion that
gradually died out in favor of a flatter natural fit.

### Later 16th century

![](Doublet_MET_DT6135.jpg "fig:Doublet_MET_DT6135.jpg")\] Through the
[Tudor period](Tudor_period "wikilink"), fashionable doublets remained
close-fitting with baggy [sleeves](sleeve "wikilink"), and elaborate
surface decoration such as *pinks* (patterns of small cuts in the
fabric), slashes, [embroidery](embroidery "wikilink"), and applied
braid.

In the early [Elizabethan](Elizabethan "wikilink") period, doublets were
padded over the belly with [bombast](bombast "wikilink") in a "pouter
pigeon" or "peascod" silhouette. Sleeve attachments at the shoulder were
disguised by decorative *wings*, *tabs*, or
[piccadills](piccadill "wikilink"), and short skirt-like
[peplums](peplum_(clothing) "wikilink") or piccadills covered the waist
of the [hose](hose_(clothing) "wikilink") or
[breeches](breeches "wikilink"). Padding gradually fell out of fashion
again, and the doublet became close-fitting with a deep V-waistline.

### 17th century

and breeches fastened with *points* of 1629, by [Daniel Mijtens the
Elder](Daniel_Mijtens_the_Elder "wikilink").\]\] By the 17th century,
doublets were short-waisted. A typical sleeve of this period was full
and slashed to show the shirt beneath; a later style was full and
*paned* or slashed to just below the elbow and snug below. Decorative
[ribbon](ribbon "wikilink") *points* were pulled through eyelets on the
breeches and the waist of the doublet to keep the breeches in place, and
were tied in elaborate bows.

The doublet fell permanently out of fashion in the mid-17th century when
[Louis XIV of France](Louis_XIV_of_France "wikilink") and [Charles II of
England](Charles_II_of_England "wikilink") established a court costume
for men consisting of a long [coat](coat_(clothing) "wikilink"), a
[waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink"), a [cravat](cravat "wikilink"), a
[wig](Wig_(hair) "wikilink"), and breeches—the ancestor of the modern
[suit](suit_(clothes) "wikilink").
