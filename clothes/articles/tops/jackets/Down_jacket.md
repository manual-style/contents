A **down jacket** or **puffer jacket** is a quilted, padded jacket
filled with [down feathers](down_feathers "wikilink") (usually duck or
goose down). This material is usually used to insulate an Outer layer
which is usually some synthetic fibre such as nylon or polyester.

## History

The first down jacket, then known as an "eiderdown coat", was designed
by Australian chemist [George Finch](George_Finch_(chemist) "wikilink")
for the [1922 Everest expedition](1922_Everest_expedition "wikilink")
and made by SW Silver and Co. It was bright green, composed of hot-air
balloon fabric. Finch's jacket was initially mocked by other members of
the party, but later won respect for its effectiveness in the windy
mountain environment.[1] Since this time many fashion designers have
adapted and commercialised the concept of the puffer jacket.
