The **Eisenhower jacket**, or **"Ike" jacket**, is a type of waist
length jacket or [blouson](blouson "wikilink") developed for the U.S.
Army during the later stages of World War II and named after [Dwight D.
Eisenhower](Dwight_D._Eisenhower "wikilink"). Intended to be worn on its
own or as an insulating layer beneath the [M-43 Field
Jacket](U.S._Army_M-1943_Uniform "wikilink"), it featured a pleated
back, adjustable waist band, fly-front buttons, bellows chest pockets,
slash side pockets, and [shoulder
straps](Shoulder_strap#Military_shoulder_strap "wikilink").

## Overview

Until the late-1930s, the [United States
Army](United_States_Army "wikilink")’s field uniform consisted of a
[wool](wool "wikilink") [shirt](shirt "wikilink"), mid-hip-length
"all-purpose service coat" and wool overcoat. Save for its belted waist,
the single-breasted service coat resembled a
[suit](suit_(clothing) "wikilink") or [sport
coat](sport_coat "wikilink") more than a uniform. Little changed since
World War I, it featured notched lapels and five metal buttons from its
open collar to its belted waist. Made of heavy wool
[serge](Serge_(fabric) "wikilink"), it touted two flapped and
button-through patch pockets at the breast and two identically styled
patch pockets below its belted waist – its four pockets either
box-pleated or bellows-styled-pleats.[1]

Using [civilian](civilian "wikilink")
"[windbreakers](windbreaker "wikilink")" as its ideal design objective,
the army began a four-year study in 1935 to develop a more practical and
effective combat jacket to replace the service coat.

![](M1941_Jacket.jpg "M1941_Jacket.jpg")

In 1940, it first adopted the first pattern field jacket, the "Parsons
Jacket" named for Major General [James K.
Parsons](James_K._Parsons "wikilink") who helped with its development.
This was quickly followed by an updated pattern, using the same
nomenclature. Simply designed and modeled after a civilian windbreaker
made by John Rissman & Sons of Chicago, it was a short, button-front
weatherproof [jacket](jacket "wikilink") with a tight fitting waist and
two flapped and button-through front pockets.

In early 1943, front-line skirmishes in [North
Africa](North_Africa "wikilink") and [Europe](Europe "wikilink") proved
the Service Coat, as well as the field jacket, inappropriate for combat.
The Service Coat was re-designated for [garrison](garrison "wikilink")
and parade duty and the field jacket was replaced by a new and
completely redesigned Field Jacket, M-1943.[2]

## Field Jacket, O.D. ("Parsons Jacket")

Although the Field Jacket, O.D. (more widely known as the "Parsons
Jacket" or the modern term "M41 Jacket") was widely used in many
theaters during World War II, it was found to be an unsatisfactory
solution for the soldiers using it. The War Department created a new
field jacket based on the layering principle to give greater flexibility
for the numerous environmental conditions encountered in the world-wide
war.[3]

## Field Jacket, M-1943

![](M1943_Field_Jacket.jpg "fig:M1943_Field_Jacket.jpg") Built around
the [layering](layered_clothing "wikilink") principle, the
[M-1943](U.S._Army_M-1943_Uniform "wikilink") became the basic building
block of a multi-environment, all-season [combat](combat "wikilink")
uniform being developed by the Office of the Quartermaster General
(OQMG) for worldwide combat.[4]

On May 15, 1943, the [Air Transport
Command](Air_Transport_Command_(United_States_Air_Force) "wikilink")
(ATC) recommended development of a short, waist cropped woolen field
jacket that could be worn under the M-1943 as an added
[insulator](Thermal_insulation "wikilink").

## Field jackets, wool, O.D.

By mid-1944, the OQMG finalized the several layering components of its
multi-environment combat uniform, anointing the M-1943 Field Jacket its
basic, universal building block. A completely new design, the M-1943
touted a wind-proof, olive drab colored [cotton](cotton "wikilink")
[poplin](poplin "wikilink") outer shell with internal layers that could
be added or eliminated depending on local battle conditions. In cold
[environs](wikt:environ "wikilink"), its notched lapels converted to a
stand-up, storm-flap for added neck protections. A pile jacket
[liner](wikt:Special:Search/liner "wikilink") and fur-edged hood could
also be added.[5]

During the Autumn of 1943, the [Army Air
Corps](United_States_Army_Air_Corps "wikilink") prototype jacket was
sent to Chief Quartermaster of the [European Theater of
Operations](European_Theater_of_Operations "wikilink") for review and
possible adoption by ETO commanding general, [Dwight D.
Eisenhower](Dwight_D._Eisenhower "wikilink").

## Eisenhower jacket

![](Allied_Commanders_after_Germany_Surrendered.jpg "fig:Allied_Commanders_after_Germany_Surrendered.jpg")
Eisenhower had already requested a waist-cropped style; stemming from
his appreciation of the functionality of the British [battle
jacket](Battle_Dress "wikilink"). According to Carlo D’Este in his book,
“Eisenhower: A Soldier’s Life” (citing an eyewitness account by James
Parton) while visiting the VII Bomber Command in England in 1942,
Eisenhower openly admired a uniform jacket worn by Maj. Gen. Ira C.
Eaker which Eaker had specially made by a London tailor modeled loosely
after the standard dress of the British armed forces. Eaker gave
Eisenhower the jacket, which fit Eisenhower. Thereafter Eisenhower had
similar jackets made in the same style. D’Este credits Eaker for
actually creating the Eisenhower jacket. [6]

The M-44 jacket that emerged was fundamentally a waist-length M-43, with
some improvements. Made of olive drab 18-ounce wool
[serge](Serge_(fabric) "wikilink"), it shared the notched
[lapel](Jacket_lapel "wikilink") "storm collar", snag-free "fly front"
buttons and flapped, bellows breast pockets, shoulder straps for gear
retention, and roomy sleeves to accommodate insulating layers.[7]

Staggered cuff buttons adjusted for layering or allowed a loose fit in
warmer conditions, as did adjustable waist buckles. A pair of
"action-back" pleats extended from shoulder to waistband, providing
freedom of movement with a slim fit. Intended to be worn on its own or
underneath the M-43,, the "Ike jacket", was classified standard issue in
November 1944, and additionally designated as the Army’s dress and
parade uniform.

According to [Paul Fussell](Paul_Fussell "wikilink")’s Uniforms,
"Eisenhower had a reputation among his troops as an eminently decent
man, friendly and sympathetic," an admiration that Ike elevated even
further, tells Fussell, by having the bravado to casually rest his hands
inside his pocket and "violate the sacred Army injunction." That
anecdote, Fussell says, explains why Eisenhower refused to adorn his
personal jacket with gilded buttons: He considered his jacket an
every-warrior’s combat uniform.[8] Eisenhower died in 1969 and was
buried dressed in his famous short green jacket.[9]

## US Marine Corps and the Vandegrift jacket

Following the [Guadalcanal Campaign](Guadalcanal_Campaign "wikilink"),
the [1st Marine
Division](1st_Marine_Division_(United_States) "wikilink") under Major
General [Alexander Vandegrift](Alexander_Vandegrift "wikilink") were
posted to the cooler climate of [Melbourne](Melbourne "wikilink")
Australia. As the Marines only had dungarees and tan summer uniforms,
they were issued Australian army [battle dress](battle_dress "wikilink")
with the Marines calling the short jacket the ***Vandegrift Jacket***.
An American made forest green version was issued to officers in December
1944 and to enlisted Marines in August 1945.[10] The Vandegrift jacket
was retained until 1960.

## Post-World War II redesigns and adaptations

![](Michael_Fisher.jpg "fig:Michael_Fisher.jpg") wearing the [Border
Patrol's](U.S._Border_Patrol "wikilink") version of the Ike Jacket with
[peaked lapel](Lapel#Peaked_lapel "wikilink")\]\]

Post-World War II development of the U.S. field jacket was momentous. In
1947, the Army introduced a shorter and better tailored version of the
M-44. Designated the MQ-1 and designed solely as a [dress and parade
uniform](Dress_uniform "wikilink"), the jacket was again refined in 1950
and re-introduced as the M-1950 Field Jacket, but without button cuffs.
With the later introduction of the "Army green" [U.S. Army service
uniform](U.S._Army_service_uniform#Green_Service_Uniform "wikilink") in
1957, the Ike jacket gradually began to disappear domestically but was
still a uniform option for troops stationed in international theaters.

In 1947, the [United States Air
Force](United_States_Air_Force "wikilink") (USAF) added still another
Ike jacket design iteration, the M-47, and continued its use for the
next two years, before changing its color to "[Air Force
blue](Air_Force_blue "wikilink")" in 1949, where it remained a signature
of the USAF, until being retired in 1964.[11]

The design of the M-1943 jacket was to prove so successful that many
military forces around the world still wear field jackets that closely
follow its original designs. During the 1950s, a modified version,
called the M-1950, was issued to U.S. forces in
[Korea](Korea "wikilink"). It had a button-in liner instead of the
separate liner garment as in the M-1943. During the next year, the
sometimes permanently hooded, M-1951 coat came into use. It was another
very similar design, but now had both a zip instead of buttons under the
front fly and metal snap closures for the pockets. The [M-1951 field
jacket](M-1951_field_jacket "wikilink") was actually not sent to the
forces in Korea until after the 1953 armistice and so was not seen
during the [Korean War](Korean_War "wikilink"). It thus remained in
service until replaced by the [M-1965 field
jacket](M-1965_field_jacket "wikilink") in 1965.[12]

Thanks to its greater comfort and the unobstructed ease it offered while
operating a vehicle or brandishing a side-arm, the Ike jacket design
became a popular post-WWII uniform staple among Federal and state law
enforcement agencies as well as with countless numbers of municipal and
civilian police departments throughout America.

To this day, uniforms of the [U.S. Border
Patrol](U.S._Border_Patrol "wikilink"), along with most allied agencies
within its broader, umbrella department, the [U.S. Customs and Border
Protection](U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection "wikilink") Agency
(USCBPA) and the [National Park
Service](National_Park_Service "wikilink") (NPS) have a dress jacket
that is nearly identical to the Ike jacket original.
