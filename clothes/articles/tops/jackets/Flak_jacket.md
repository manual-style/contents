A **flak jacket** or **flak vest** is a form of [body
armor](body_armor "wikilink"). A flak jacket is designed to provide
protection from [case fragments](Fragmentation_(weaponry) "wikilink")
("frag") from [high explosive](high_explosive "wikilink") weaponry, such
as [anti-aircraft artillery](anti-aircraft_artillery "wikilink") ("flak"
is a German contraction for , "aircraft-defense gun"),
[grenades](grenades "wikilink"), some pellets used in
[shotguns](shotguns "wikilink") and [anti-personnel
mines](land_mines "wikilink"), and other lower-velocity
[projectiles](projectile "wikilink"). It is not designed to protect
against [bullets](bullets "wikilink") fired from small arms such as
rifles or handguns. However, certain flak jackets are able to sustain
certain gunshots, depending on the armor, the projectile, the angle at
which the shot was fired (an oblique angle for example), and the range
from which the shot was fired.

The term "flak jacket" is often colloquially applied to newer body armor
featuring protection against [small arms](small_arms "wikilink")
projectiles, but the original usage predated the existence of functional
[bulletproof vests](bulletproof_vest "wikilink") and the two are not
interchangeable in performance.

## History

Anecdotes describing garments designed to protect the wearer from
penetrating weapons can be found far back into recorded history. Two
types of protective garment from the [American Civil
War](American_Civil_War "wikilink") in the 1860s had a basic design
similar to the flak jacket or ballistic armor of modern times in that
solid plates were used as the main ballistic protection. The "Soldiers'
Bullet Proof Vest" was manufactured by the G. & D. Cook & Company of
[New Haven](New_Haven "wikilink"),
[Connecticut](Connecticut "wikilink"). It consisted of two pieces of
[steel](steel "wikilink") inserted into the pockets of a regular black
military [vest](vest "wikilink"). Versions for
[infantry](infantry "wikilink") weighed 3 ½ pounds while a version for
[cavalry](cavalry "wikilink") and [artillery](artillery "wikilink")
weighed 7 pounds. They sold for $5-$7. A more medieval-looking type of
armor was made by the Atwater Armor Company, also of New Haven. It
consisted of four large plates of steel held on the body by broad metal
hooks over the shoulders and a belt around the waist. The Atwater vest
was heavier than the Cook models and cost about twice as much.[1]

During [World War I](World_War_I "wikilink"), a number of British and
American officers recognized that many casualties could be avoided if
effective armor were available. Isolated efforts at developing armor
were made, and soldiers could make individual purchases or efforts, but
there was no armor issued to the troops. As it is today, issues of
weight, cost, availability of materials and/or environmental stability
complicated the issue of developing armor that would also be effective.
For example, soft armor made of [silk](silk "wikilink") was tried on a
small scale based on Japanese designs, but this material did not last
well under harsh environmental conditions.[2]

The first usage of the term "flak jacket" refers to the armour
originally developed by the [Wilkinson
Sword](Wilkinson_Sword "wikilink") company during [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink") to help protect [Royal Air
Force](Royal_Air_Force "wikilink") (RAF) aircrew from the [flying
debris](spall "wikilink") and [shell
fragments](Fragmentation_(weaponry) "wikilink") thrown by
[German](Germany "wikilink") [anti-aircraft
guns](anti-aircraft_gun "wikilink")' high-explosive shells
([flak](flak "wikilink") itself is an abbreviation for the German word
"Fliegerabwehrkanone" (*aircraft-defense gun*)).[3] The idea for the
flak jacket came from Col. [Malcolm C.
Grow](Malcolm_C._Grow "wikilink"), Surgeon of the US Eighth Air Force in
Britain. He thought that many wounds he was treating could have been
prevented by some kind of light armor. In 1943 he was awarded the
[Legion of Merit](Legion_of_Merit "wikilink") for developing the flak
vest.

Unfortunately, flak jackets proved to be too bulky for wear within the
confines of the RAF's standard [bomber
aircraft](bomber_aircraft "wikilink"), the [Avro
Lancaster](Avro_Lancaster "wikilink"). The Royal Air Force subsequently
offered the jackets to the [United States Army Air
Forces](United_States_Army_Air_Forces "wikilink"), which adopted them as
a [Defense Standard](Defense_Standard "wikilink").[4] The UK
subsequently supplied the USAAF with 9,600 flak jackets under reverse
[lend-lease](lend-lease "wikilink").[5]

During [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), flak jackets and steel
helmets were worn by US Navy personnel on aircraft carriers during
battle, since the ships and especially their flight decks offered little
protection for their crew. The jackets were supposed to protect against
shell fragments and heat.

## Ballistic protection

Col. Grow’s request to the Wilkinson Sword company was to develop a vest
that could stop a [.45 caliber](.45_ACP "wikilink") round fired at close
range.[6] Although flak jackets offered some basic protection against
small caliber bullets and shell fragments (which was valued by their
users),[7] ultimately they proved to be less effective than hoped. Flak
jackets are now generally considered to be inferior to ballistic vests.

It was claimed that the M-1951 flak jacket could stop a 90 grain
[7.62×25mm Tokarev](7.62×25mm_Tokarev "wikilink") pistol round at the
muzzle of the gun. However, even the Vietnam era revised flak jacket was
not really designed to stop an [AK-47](AK-47 "wikilink") round
([7.62×39mm](7.62×39mm "wikilink")) fired at close range. Nevertheless,
it did a good job of stopping shell blasts, rocket fragments, and slow
speed bullets fired at a moderate range.[8]

It was not until 1970 that the U.S. National Institute of Justice, which
now publishes test and performance standards for body armor, began a
deliberate program to develop body armor for law enforcement personnel
that would be effective against specific threats that were common causes
of officer injury and death. At the time that included [.38
Special](.38_Special "wikilink") and [.22 Long
Rifle](.22_Long_Rifle "wikilink") bullets, in particular, and also
bullets from 9mm, .45, and .32 caliber firearms.[9]

## Materials

The first flak [jackets](jacket "wikilink") consisted of [manganese
steel](manganese_steel "wikilink") plates sewn into a waistcoat made of
[ballistic nylon](ballistic_nylon "wikilink") (a material engineered by
the [DuPont](DuPont "wikilink") company); therefore, flak jackets
functioned as an evolved form of [plate armour](plate_armour "wikilink")
or [brigandine](brigandine "wikilink"). The first flak jacket weighed 22
pounds.[10]

During the [Korean](Korean_War "wikilink") and [Vietnam
wars](Vietnam_War "wikilink"), the flak jacket was changed and the
manganese steel plates were replaced by other materials.[11] The U.S.
Army's vests (Body Armor, Fragmentation Protective, Vest M69) weighed
under eight pounds and were made of several layers of ballistic nylon.
The vests used by the U.S. Marines (Vest, Armored M-1955) weighed more
than ten pounds and were a combination of ballistic nylon layers and
fiberglass plates known as [Doron](Doron_Plate "wikilink").[12] Doron
was made of fiberglass fibers placed in an ethyl cellulose resin under
high pressure. It was named after then-Colonel Georges F. Doriot, then
director of the Military Planning Division, Office of the Quartermaster
General.[13]

The generation of armor developed in the 1970s through the National
Institute of Justice incorporated layers of soft armor in the form of
DuPont’s [Kevlar](Kevlar "wikilink") fabric, which has since become
synonymous with ballistic protection and a general term used for several
similar ([aramid](aramid "wikilink")-based) materials.[14]
