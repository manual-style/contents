![](Fleecejacke_3.jpg "fig:Fleecejacke_3.jpg") A **fleece jacket** or
simply a **fleece** is a lightweight [casual](Casual_wear "wikilink")
[jacket](jacket "wikilink") made of a [polyester](polyester "wikilink")
[synthetic wool](Synthetic_fiber "wikilink") such as [polar
fleece](polar_fleece "wikilink").

A fleece jacket will typically have a [zipper](zipper "wikilink") up the
middle, rather than [buttons](buttons "wikilink") or other fasteners. It
will provide [thermal insulation](thermal_insulation "wikilink") but is
not normally weatherproof and so it will not effectively keep out wind
and rain.[1]

## History

Polar fleece originated in [Massachusetts](Massachusetts "wikilink") in
1979 when [Malden Mills](Malden_Mills "wikilink"), (now Polartec LLC),
and [Patagonia](Patagonia_(clothing) "wikilink") developed Synchilla
(synthetic [chinchilla](chinchilla "wikilink")).[2] It was a new, light,
strong [pile fabric](Pile_(fabric) "wikilink") meant to mimic—and in
some ways surpass—wool. Company CEO [Aaron
Feuerstein](Aaron_Feuerstein "wikilink") intentionally declined to
[patent](patent "wikilink") Polar fleece, allowing the material to be
produced cheaply and widely by many vendors, leading to the material's
quick and wide acceptance.[3][4][5]
