The **"G-1" military flight jacket** is the commonly accepted name for
the fur-lined-collar [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink")-era flight
jacket of the [United States Navy](United_States_Navy "wikilink"),
[Marine Corps](United_States_Marine_Corps "wikilink"), and [Coast
Guard](United_States_Coast_Guard "wikilink"). A similar jacket used by
the [United States Army Air
Corps](United_States_Army_Air_Corps "wikilink")/[United States Army Air
Forces](United_States_Army_Air_Forces "wikilink") was usually called the
[A-2 jacket](A-2_jacket "wikilink").

## Usage

The G-1 remains a current uniform-issue item in naval aviation for
officer and enlisted aviation personnel on flying status in the U.S.
Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard (*i.e.,* [Naval
Aviator](Naval_Aviator "wikilink"), [Naval Flight
Officer](Naval_Flight_Officer "wikilink"), Naval Flight Surgeon, Naval
Aircrewman, etc.) and is arguably best known as the leather flight
jacket worn by [Tom Cruise](Tom_Cruise "wikilink") in the film *[Top
Gun](Top_Gun "wikilink")*.

## Development

More technically, the jacket may be considered the U.S. Military flight
jacket developed in 1947 and used in the [Korean
War](Korean_War "wikilink"), since the term "G-1" was not used as a
label for this fur-collared military-issued jacket until after [World
War II](World_War_II "wikilink"). However, the term "G-1" has come to be
used for this style of naval leather flight jacket. Prior to the end of
World War II, and starting in 1940 when it was officially named by the
U.S. Navy, the jacket had the military spec number of M-422.

## Operational use

This jacket was brought to use by the [U.S. Navy](U.S._Navy "wikilink")
in the 1930s, and standardized by the Navy in 1940 as the M-422A. In
1943 this jacket, named by the Army Air Forces and the Navy as the ANJ-3
(Army Navy Jacket 3), replaced the iconic Army Air Forces [A-2
jacket](A-2_jacket "wikilink"), the most famous of U.S. Military
jackets, hence the name of ANJ-3 (vs. A-2). The M-422A replacement of
the loved and famous A-2 was, however, in the form of a non-fur-collared
version of the "G-1", currently referred to for obvious reasons as the
G-2. In 1988, the [U.S. Air Force](U.S._Air_Force "wikilink") reinstated
the A-2 jacket for all USAF flight crew personnel.

For a very brief period from 1979 until early 1981, issuance of the G-1
to new USN, USMC, and USCG flight crew personnel (*i.e.,* officer flight
students and newly designated enlisted Naval Aircrewman) was
discontinued as a budgetary economy action, with those personnel being
issued summer weight green Nomex flight jackets identical to those
issued to their [U.S. Air Force](U.S._Air_Force "wikilink")
counterparts. Replacement of worn-out G-1 jackets for extant Naval
Aviation personnel was also discontinued during this period. This action
was reversed by Secretary of the Navy action in early 1981, and those
USN, USMC, and USCG flight-crew personnel who had not received G-1
jackets were issued one retroactively.

Modifications to USN, USMC, and USCG uniform regulations in the 1990s
reduced the type and number of permissible insignia on the G-1, but
concurrently permitted wear of the G-1 jacket off base with service
uniforms.

## Commercial exploitation

Commercial versions of the jacket have been available on the consumer
market. Official military suppliers which also sold similar spec jackets
to the public include Cockpit USA, Cooper Sportswear, Orchard M/C, Brill
Bros, Schott, and Excelled. After the success of the 1986 film *[Top
Gun](Top_Gun "wikilink")*, shopping-mall leather stores carried a
variety of G-1 variants, with such features as removable fur collars and
sewn-on patches, including the ever-popular [Gulf of
Sidra](Gulf_of_Sidra_incident_(1981) "wikilink") Yacht Club patch. These
are new production and come in goatskin and cowhide varieties stamped
USN, USCG, or USMC. Jackets are offered by many companies for the
civilian market, including US Authentic MFG. Co., Lost Worlds, Gibson
and Barnes,Eastman and US Wings. \<!--> [L.L.Bean](L.L.Bean "wikilink")
is also selling a mouton-insulated and a
[Thinsulate](Thinsulate "wikilink")-insulated version of the A-2.\<--->
