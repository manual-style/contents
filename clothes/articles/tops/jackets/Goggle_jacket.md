**Goggle jackets** are a hooded windproof type jacket released in 1988
made by [C.P. Company](C.P._Company "wikilink") for the sponsoring of
[Mille Miglia](Mille_Miglia "wikilink") and open car endurance race and
became popular across Europe and in
[Britain](United_Kingdom "wikilink"). They zip up to cover the head and
face completely, except for two built-in goggles, sometimes covered with
transparent mesh or various lenses and sometimes including a mesh mouth
area for ease of breathing.

Some people wear them to protect their faces against cold and [driven
rain](driven_rain "wikilink"), some for concealment.

## Criticism

Police have claimed goggle jackets could be used by gangs and criminals
to conceal their identity. A [Northumbria
Police](Northumbria_Police "wikilink") spokesman said the jackets were
totally legal. "A hat, scarf and glasses combination could obscure
someone's identity so there are no legal powers to stop anyone wearing
these jackets." he added.[1] One web site calls them
"[burqas](burqa "wikilink") for the boys".[2]
