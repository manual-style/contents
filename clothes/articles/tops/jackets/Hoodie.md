A **hoodie** is a [sweatshirt](sweatshirt "wikilink") or a
[jacket](jacket "wikilink") with a [hood](Hood_(headgear) "wikilink").
Hoodies often include a [muff](Muff_(handwarmer) "wikilink") sewn onto
the lower front, and (usually) a [drawstring](drawstring "wikilink") to
adjust the hood opening.

## History

![](Hood,_13th_century.png "fig:Hood,_13th_century.png")\]\]

The word *[hood](wikt:hood "wikilink")* derives from the Anglo-Saxon
word *hōd*,[1] ultimately of the same root as an English *hat*.[2] The
garment's style and form can be traced back to [Medieval
Europe](Medieval_Europe "wikilink") when the normal clothing for
[monks](Christian_monasticism "wikilink") included a hood called a
[cowl](cowl "wikilink") attached to a [tunic](tunic "wikilink") or
robes,[3] and a [chaperon](chaperon_(headgear) "wikilink") or hooded
cape was very commonly worn by any outdoors worker. Its appearance was
known in England at least as early as the 12th century, possibly an
import with the [Norman conquest of
England](Norman_conquest_of_England "wikilink"), as the *capa* was "a
short hooded cloak which was common in Normandy."[4]

The hooded sweatshirt is a utilitarian garment that originated in the
1930s in the US for workers in cold [New
York](New_York_(state) "wikilink") warehouses.[5] The modern clothing
style was first produced by [Champion](Champion_(sportswear) "wikilink")
in the 1930s and marketed to laborers working in freezing temperatures
in [upstate New York](upstate_New_York "wikilink").[6] The term *hoodie*
entered popular usage in the 1990s.[7]

The hoodie took off in the [1970s](1970s_in_fashion "wikilink"), with
several factors contributing to its success. [Hip hop
culture](Hip_hop_culture "wikilink") developed in [New York
City](New_York_City "wikilink") around this time and high fashion also
contributed during this era, as Norma Kamali and other high-profile
designers embraced and glamorized the new clothing.[8] Most critical to
the hoodie's popularity during this time was its iconic appearance in
the blockbuster *[Rocky](Rocky "wikilink")* film.[9] At the same time,
hoodies started emerging in the Geek culture when Mark LoGiurato
introduced them at companies such as the Software Bottling Company.[10]
The rise of hoodies with university logos began around this time.

By the [1990s](1990s_in_fashion "wikilink"), the hoodie had evolved into
a symbol of isolation,[11] a statement of academic spirit, and several
fashion collections.[12] The association with [chavs](chav "wikilink")
or [neds](neds "wikilink") in the UK developed around this time, as
their popularity rose with that specific demographic. Young men, often
[skateboarders](Skateboarding "wikilink") or
[surfers](Surfing "wikilink"), sported the hoodie and spread the trend
across the western United States, most significantly in
[California](California "wikilink"). [Tommy
Hilfiger](Tommy_Hilfiger "wikilink"), [Giorgio
Armani](Giorgio_Armani "wikilink"), and [Ralph
Lauren](Ralph_Lauren "wikilink"), for example, used the hoodie as the
primary component for many of their collections in the 1990s.[13][14] A
crystal-studded hoodie made by rapper [Sean "Diddy"
Combs](Sean_Combs "wikilink") was acquired by the Victoria & Albert
Museum in London.[15]

### Australia

In June 2011, police in [Wynnum](Wynnum,_Queensland "wikilink"),
[Brisbane](Brisbane "wikilink"), launched a "Hoodie Free Zone"
initiative, with shopkeepers encouraged to ask hoodie-wearers to leave.
The zone is part of an initiative to educate businesses on how they can
avoid armed robberies, in which the hoodie type of clothing is often
worn.[16]

### Canada

Across Canada, hoodies are a popular clothing item sometimes worn under
a coat or jacket to provide an extra layer of clothing during the
winter. In the province of [Saskatchewan](Saskatchewan "wikilink"),
hoodies without zippers are "bunny hugs."[17]

### New Zealand

The "Hoodies on Parliament—politicians challenge youth stereotypes"
campaign was launched in May 2008 in [New
Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink") (NZ) as part of the annual national
Youth Week event, a pro-youth initiative organized to challenge youth
stereotypes. To launch the campaign, NZ politicians, including National
MP Nicky Wagner, Green Party MPs Sue Bradford, Nandor Tanczos and
Metiria Turei, and Maori party MP Hone Harawira, wore hoodies while
standing on the steps of the country's parliament. Archbishop David
Moxon, Archbishop of the Anglican Dioceses, and Brian Turner President
of the Methodist Church of NZ also participated in the campaign.[18]

Support and criticism were raised by politicians, who were divided over
the 2008 event.[19][20] One strong response was drawn from a local
government council member, Dale Evans, who donned a [Ku Klux
Klan](Ku_Klux_Klan "wikilink") outfit in protest, citing the hoodie as
"not an appropriate article of clothing to celebrate."[21]

"Goodie in a Hoodie" day was then run in 2009 by New Zealand Adolescent
Health and Development (NZAAHD) in partnership with Age Concern—the
organisations used the campaign to highlight the stereotypes that both
young people and the elderly face in New Zealand. Liz Baxendine,
president of Age Concern at the time, said to the media:

> Older people and young people have a lot in common. We both face
> stereotypes based on our age rather than our real achievements and
> outlook on life ... we've got to destigmatise the hoodie and see it
> for what it is. Everyone wears them. We need to take the hoodie
> back![22]

### United Kingdom

In the UK, hoodies have been the subject of much criticism; some
shoplifters have used the hood to conceal their identities from
[CCTV](Closed-circuit_television "wikilink") cameras in shopping
centres.[23] The hoodie became a popular clothing item by the 1990s. By
the 21st century, it had gained a negative image, being associated with
trouble-making, intimidating teens and [anti-social
behaviour](Anti-social_behavior "wikilink"). It became one of the later
items associated with "[chavs](chav "wikilink")", or
[Neds](Neds "wikilink").

Angela McRobbie, professor of communications at [Goldsmiths
College](Goldsmiths_College "wikilink") in the UK, says the appeal of
the hoodie is its promise of anonymity, mystery and anxiety. "The point
of origin is obviously black American [hip-hop](hip-hop "wikilink")
culture, now thoroughly mainstream and a key part of the global economy.
Leisure and sportswear adopted for everyday wear suggests a distance
from the world of office [suit](suit_(clothing) "wikilink") or [school
uniform](school_uniform "wikilink"). Rap culture celebrates defiance, as
it narrates the experience of [social
exclusion](social_exclusion "wikilink"). Musically and stylistically, it
projects menace and danger as well as anger and rage. The hooded top is
one in a long line of garments chosen by young people, usually boys, to
which are ascribed meanings suggesting that they are 'up to no good'. In
the past, such appropriation was usually restricted to membership of
specific youth cultures—leather jackets, [bondage
trousers](bondage_trousers "wikilink")—but nowadays it is the norm among
young people to flag up their music and cultural preferences in this
way, hence the adoption of the hoodie by boys across the boundaries of
age, ethnicity and class."[24]

In May 2005, [Bluewater](Bluewater_(shopping_centre) "wikilink")
shopping centre in [Kent](Kent "wikilink") caused outrage by launching a
code of conduct which bans its shoppers from sporting hoodies or
[baseball caps](baseball_cap "wikilink"), although the garments remain
on sale. [John Prescott](John_Prescott "wikilink") welcomed the move,
stating that he had felt threatened by the presence of hooded teenagers
at a motorway service station.[25] Then-[Prime
Minister](Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") [Tony
Blair](Tony_Blair "wikilink") openly supported this stance and vowed to
clamp down on the [anti-social
behaviour](anti-social_behavior "wikilink") with which hoodie-wearers
are sometimes associated. London-based rapper [Lady
Sovereign](Lady_Sovereign "wikilink") published a single titled
"[Hoodie](Hoodie_(Lady_Sovereign_song) "wikilink")" in protest as part
of a "Save the Hoodie" campaign.[26]

In 2005, [Coombeshead College](Coombeshead_College "wikilink") in the
south-west of England allowed the hoodie to become part of the boys'
[school uniform](school_uniform "wikilink"), but the hood could be put
up only when it rained. The principal, Richard Haigh, stated that the
move would help to calm some of what he called the "hysteria"
surrounding the garment.[27]

The [JCB Academy](JCB_Academy "wikilink") allows hoodies, but only a
[navy blue](navy_blue "wikilink") type sold in the school shop.

In February 2006, a 58-year-old teacher who was wearing a hooded top was
asked to remove it when entering a [Tesco](Tesco "wikilink") store in
[Swindon](Swindon "wikilink"). According to the teacher, she was wearing
the hood because "my hair's a mess". The store did not have a hoodie
policy. The shop apologized and said it was taking action to "make sure
this doesn't happen again."[28]

In July 2006, [David Cameron](David_Cameron "wikilink"), leader of the
[Conservative Party](Conservative_Party_(UK) "wikilink"), made a speech
suggesting that the hoodie was worn more for defensive than offensive
purposes.[29] The speech was referred to as "hug a hoodie" by the
[Labour Party](Labour_Party_(UK) "wikilink").[30][31]

Despite the controversy, the hoodie has been embraced by people from all
backgrounds. [Zara Phillips](Zara_Phillips "wikilink"), a member of the
British royal family, has included hoodies in her range of equestrian
clothing at [Musto](Musto_(company) "wikilink").[32]

In 2019 the British fashion label Burberry had to apologize for an
inappropriate hoodie. On its runaway show, the fashion label featured a
piece of cloth with a “noose” around the neck, which caused an
outrageous reaction in social media.[33][34]

### United States

![](Unabomber-sketch.png "fig:Unabomber-sketch.png") sketch of Unabomber
[Ted Kaczynski](Ted_Kaczynski "wikilink") \]\] Throughout the U.S., it
is common for middle-school, high-school, and college students to wear
sweatshirts—with or without hoods—that display their respective school
names or mascots across the chest, either as part of a uniform or
personal preference.[35] Hoodies have become mainstream fashion in the
U.S., transcending the clothing item's original utilitarian purpose,[36]
similar to [jeans](jeans "wikilink"). This clothing item has found its
way into a variety of styles, even so far as to be worn under a suit
jacket.[37]

The hooded sweatshirt is a utilitarian garment that originated in the
1930s for workers in cold [New York](New_York_(state) "wikilink")
warehouses.[38] Hoodies were later adopted by [hip
hop](hip_hop "wikilink") culture as a symbol of what one reporter termed
"cool anonymity and vague menace."[39] When the garment was depicted in
FBI composite drawings of Unabomber [Ted
Kaczynski](Ted_Kaczynski "wikilink"), the hoodie became linked to "seedy
threatening criminality," thereby further asserting its non-mainstream
symbolism.[40]

In 2012 [Trayvon Martin](shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin "wikilink") was shot
wearing a hoodie, and protests over his death involved hoodies.[41][42]
[Fox News](Fox_News_Channel "wikilink") host [Geraldo
Rivera](Geraldo_Rivera "wikilink") encouraged young black people to stop
wearing hoodies[43] though he later apologized for his comments.[44]
Zimmerman's defense team offered what was called "the hoodie defense".
They argued that it was reasonable for Zimmerman to regard Martin's
hoodie as a threat. According to [Carolyn
Fluehr-Lobban](Carolyn_Fluehr-Lobban "wikilink"), author of *Race and
Racism*, following Zimmerman's trial the garment became emblematic of
the [Black Lives Matter](Black_Lives_Matter "wikilink") movement.[45]

[Facebook](Facebook "wikilink") CEO [Mark
Zuckerberg](Mark_Zuckerberg "wikilink") often wears a plain grey hoodie
rather than a business suit, drawing comments during his company's 2012
[initial public offering](initial_public_offering "wikilink").[46]

In 2015, Oklahoma state representative [Don
Barrington](Don_Barrington "wikilink") proposed a bill to criminalize
wearing a "robe, mask or other disguise" in public that would
"intentionally conceal the wearer's identity", a bill which was
criticized as an attempt to criminalize the wearing of the hoodie.[47]
