A **jupe** referred to a loose-fitting [wool](wool "wikilink") jacket or
[tunic](tunic "wikilink") for men.[1] It was later restricted to an item
of women's and children's clothing.

The term has now disappeared but was used up until the 19th century.[2]
Usage of this meaning of jupe for menswear became restricted to "jupe
panels" in jackets. (In [French](French_language "wikilink") the word
*jupe* means "skirt.")
