![](Giubbotto_Chiodo.jpg "fig:Giubbotto_Chiodo.jpg") A **leather
jacket** is a [jacket](jacket "wikilink")-length
[coat](Coat_(clothing) "wikilink") that is usually worn on top of other
apparel or item of clothing, and made from the [tanned
hide](leather "wikilink") of various animals. The leather material is
typically [dyed](dyed "wikilink") black, or various shades of brown, but
a wide range of colors is possible. Leather jackets can be designed for
many purposes, and specific styles have been associated with subcultures
such as [greasers](greaser_(subculture) "wikilink"),
[rednecks](redneck "wikilink"), [cowboys](cowboy "wikilink"),
[motorcyclists](motorcycling "wikilink"),
[military](military "wikilink")
[aviators](pilot_(aeronautics) "wikilink"),
[mobsters](mobster "wikilink"), police, [secret
agents](secret_agent "wikilink"), and music subcultures
([punks](Punk_subculture "wikilink"),
[goths](Goth_subculture "wikilink"),
[metalheads](Heavy_metal_subculture "wikilink"),
[rivetheads](rivethead "wikilink")), who have worn the garment for
protective or fashionable reasons, and occasionally to create a
potentially intimidating appearance. National Leather Jacket day occurs
every June 14th since the Hell's Angels proposed the idea in 1975.

Most modern leather jackets are produced in Pakistan, India, Canada,
Mexico and the United States, using hides left over from the [meat
industry](meat_industry "wikilink"). Fabrics simulating leather such as
[polyurethane](polyurethane "wikilink") or [PVC](PVC "wikilink") are
used as alternatives to authentic animal hide leather depending on the
needs of the wearer such as those pursuing [vegan](vegan "wikilink")
lifestyles or for economic reasons as synthetic fibers tend to be less
costly than authentic leather.

## History

wearing a black leather coat based on the [reefer
jacket](reefer_jacket "wikilink") \]\]

In the early 1900s aviators and members of the military wore brown
leather [flight jackets](flight_jacket "wikilink"). One of the first
modern leather jackets the type A1 was created by Chapal in 1925 [1].
During the [Second World War](World_War_II "wikilink") the garments
became known as "bomber jackets" and were heavily insulated and prized
for their warmth. The jacket was often part of an overall
uniform-ensemble meant to protect bomber pilots from exposure to the
extreme climate conditions found at high altitude, and often
incorporated [sheepskin](sheepskin "wikilink"), using the intact
[fleece](Wool "wikilink") on the inside for warmth.

Russian [Bolsheviks](Bolsheviks "wikilink") commonly wore leather
jackets, which became a quasi-uniform for
[commissars](commissar "wikilink") during the [Russian Civil
War](Russian_Civil_War "wikilink"), and later for the members of the
[Cheka](Cheka "wikilink"). [Yakov Sverdlov](Yakov_Sverdlov "wikilink")
allegedly initiated this practice.[2]

## Raw material

[Antelope](Antelope "wikilink"),
[buckskin](buckskin_(leather) "wikilink"), lambskin,
[sheepskin](sheepskin "wikilink") and cowhide are the hides most
commonly used to make leather jackets. As soon as the skin is removed
from the animal at the meat processing plant, it is refrigerated,
salted, or packed in barrels of brine. It is then sent to the tannery
where the skins undergo a series of processes designed to preserve and
soften the hides. [Sewing](Sewing "wikilink") materials such as
[thread](thread_(yarn) "wikilink"),
[lining](lining_(sewing) "wikilink"), seam tape,
[buttons](buttons "wikilink"), [snaps](Snap_fastener "wikilink") and
[zippers](zippers "wikilink") are generally bought from outside vendors
and stored in the garment factory.

in a leather jacket at the 2010 [World Economic
Forum](World_Economic_Forum "wikilink")\]\] In the latter half of the
20th century, the leather jacket—in many forms—achieved iconic status
and general acceptance through an inextricable link to
[Hollywood](Hollywood "wikilink"). Such jackets were popularized by
numerous stars in the 1940s and 1950s, including actor [Jimmy
Stewart](James_Stewart "wikilink") in the film *[Night
Passage](Night_Passage_(film) "wikilink")* (1957), who had actually
commanded a U.S. [bomber](bomber "wikilink")
[squadron](Squadron_(aviation) "wikilink") during [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink").[3] The brown leather jacket has become a
*[de rigueur](wikt:de_rigueur "wikilink")* part of wardrobe for the
Hollywood adventurer, from [Gary Cooper](Gary_Cooper "wikilink") in
*[For Whom the Bell Tolls](For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls_(film) "wikilink")*
to [Harrison Ford](Harrison_Ford "wikilink") in the [Indiana
Jones](Indiana_Jones "wikilink") film series.
![](For_Whom_The_Bell_Tolls_trailer.jpg "fig:For_Whom_The_Bell_Tolls_trailer.jpg")
wore a leather jacket in his role as an [International
Brigades](International_Brigades "wikilink") guerrilla fighter in the
[Spanish Civil War](Spanish_Civil_War "wikilink") in *[For Whom the Bell
Tolls](For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls_(film) "wikilink")*\]\] A leather jacket
could be used to shape a character, providing an important ingredient
used to define the very essence of
'[cool](Cool_(aesthetic) "wikilink")'. Prime examples include the
[Perfecto motorcycle jacket](Perfecto_motorcycle_jacket "wikilink") worn
by [Marlon Brando](Marlon_Brando "wikilink")'s [Johnny
Strabler](Johnny_Strabler "wikilink") in *[The Wild
One](The_Wild_One "wikilink")* (1953), [Honor
Blackman](Honor_Blackman "wikilink") as [Cathy
Gale](Cathy_Gale "wikilink") on *[The
Avengers](The_Avengers_(TV_series) "wikilink")*, and [Michael
Pare](Michael_Pare "wikilink") in *[Eddie and the
Cruisers](Eddie_and_the_Cruisers "wikilink")* duo (1983 and 1989). As
such, these all served to popularize leather jackets in American youth
from the "[greaser subculture](Greaser_(subculture) "wikilink")" of the
1950s and early 1960s. Later depictions of this subculture are seen via
[The Fonz](Fonzie "wikilink") from the television series *[Happy
Days](Happy_Days "wikilink")*, which was produced in the 1970s and
1980s, but shows life in the 1950s and 1960s (Fonzie's leather jacket is
now housed in the [Smithsonian
Institution](Smithsonian_Institution "wikilink")), and in the film duos
*[Eddie and the Cruisers](Eddie_and_the_Cruisers "wikilink")* and
*[Grease](Grease_(film) "wikilink")*. Flight jackets, also (occasionally
with [fleece](Wool "wikilink") collars, as seen in the film *[Top
Gun](Top_Gun "wikilink")* (1986), have remained fashionable for decades.

## Popular culture

There are many more examples of iconic leather jackets worn in popular
culture, such as the [Schott Perfecto](Schott_Perfecto "wikilink") worn
by the [T-800](T-800 "wikilink") character of [The
Terminator](The_Terminator "wikilink") films and the longer ¾ length
trench coat style worn by action heroes such as [Steven
Seagal](Steven_Seagal "wikilink"), and [Keanu
Reeves](Keanu_Reeves "wikilink") and [Laurence
Fishburne](Laurence_Fishburne "wikilink") in *[The
Matrix](The_Matrix "wikilink")* films, or by [Richard
Gibson](Richard_Gibson "wikilink") as Herr Otto Flick on the television
sitcom *['Allo 'Allo!]('Allo_'Allo! "wikilink")*.

Another example is the leather jackets worn by [Brad
Pitt](Brad_Pitt "wikilink") in *[Fight Club](Fight_Club "wikilink")*,
where the antagonist Tyler Durden constantly appears with different
variations of his red leather jacket. Other famous leather jacket icons
include those worn by members of the [Black
Panthers](Black_Panthers "wikilink") in the 1960s and 1970s, the
[Ramones](Ramones "wikilink") which made it a trend in the [punk
subculture](punk_subculture "wikilink"), members of [heavy
metal](Heavy_metal_music "wikilink") subcultures, etc.

In most popular culture examples, the jackets are worn by people
cultivating an intimidating and potentially violent or rebellious image.
The tan leather jacket in particular has become very popular with the
[Brit Pop](Brit_Pop "wikilink") and
[Indie](Independent_music "wikilink") music image and culture and is
famously worn by people such as [Kelly Jones](Kelly_Jones "wikilink") of
the [Stereophonics](Stereophonics "wikilink"). The Punk culture also
"rocks" the leather jacket with accessories such as chains, studs, cuts,
and sketch designs. Many "Metal Heads" go with the Judas Priest look
(black leather jacket, black leather pants, chains, and lots of metal
studs).

## As safety gear

There is a substantial difference between leather jackets made for
fashion purposes, and those worn for protection, such as [motorcycle
personal protective
equipment](motorcycle_personal_protective_equipment "wikilink"). Leather
jackets designed for protective use are [safety
equipment](safety_equipment "wikilink") and are heavier, thicker, and
sometimes even equipped with armor, thus they are a practical item of
clothing regardless of the symbolism invested in them by popular
culture. A leather jacket primarily designed for fashion purposes would
not be much protection in a motorcycle accident because of the jacket's
flimsy construction. Motorcycle jackets often have more substantial
[zips](zipper "wikilink"), weatherproof pockets and closures, higher
collars, and are styled to be longer at the back than the front to
protect the kidneys of the riders from the cold while the rider is bent
forward over the motorcycle.
