## History

![](Yohji_Yamamoto_wool_suit_c_1990.jpg "fig:Yohji_Yamamoto_wool_suit_c_1990.jpg")
The Nehru jacket is a variation to the [Jodhpuri](Jodhpuri "wikilink")
where the material is often khadi. The [Jodhpuri](Jodhpuri "wikilink")
itself is an evolution from the [Angarkha](Angarkha "wikilink").
Popularized during the terms of Jawaharlal Nehru, these distinct
Bandhgalas made from khadi remain popular to this day.[1]

## Style

Unlike the achkan, which falls somewhere below the knees of the wearer,
the Nehru jacket is shorter. Jawaharlal Nehru, notably, never wore a
Nehru jacket.[2]

## Popularity

The jacket began to be marketed as the *Nehru jacket* in Europe and
America in the mid 1960s. It was briefly popular there in the late 1960s
and early 1970s, its popularity spurred by the aspirational class'
growing awareness of elite foreign cultures, by the
[minimalism](minimalism "wikilink") of the [Mod
lifestyle](Mod_(subculture) "wikilink") and, in particular, by [the
Beatles](the_Beatles "wikilink") and subsequently [the
Monkees](the_Monkees "wikilink").[3][4][5]

Several villains in the [*James Bond* film
series](James_Bond_in_film "wikilink"), including [Dr.
No](Julius_No "wikilink"), [Ernst Stavro
Blofeld](Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld "wikilink"), [Karl
Stromberg](Karl_Stromberg "wikilink") and [Kamal
Khan](Octopussy "wikilink"), appear wearing a Nehru jacket. [The
Master](The_Master_(Doctor_Who) "wikilink"), the arch-enemy of [The
Doctor](The_Doctor_(Doctor_Who) "wikilink") in *[Doctor
Who](Doctor_Who "wikilink")* is also seen wearing one in his first and
sixth incarnations.
