Detail of a fashion plate from the *Sartorial Arts Journal*, New York,
1901\]\] A **Norfolk jacket** is a loose, belted,
[single-breasted](single-breasted "wikilink") jacket with [box
pleats](pleat "wikilink") on the back and front, with a belt or
half-belt. It was originally designed as a shooting coat that did not
bind when the elbow was raised to fire. It was named either after the
[Duke of Norfolk](Duke_of_Norfolk "wikilink") or after the county of
[Norfolk](Norfolk "wikilink") and was made fashionable after the 1860s
in the sporting circle of the Prince of Wales, later [Edward
VII](Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"), whose country
residence was [Sandringham House](Sandringham_House "wikilink") in
Norfolk.[1][2] The style was long popular for boys' jackets and suits,
and is still used in some (primarily military and police) uniforms.
