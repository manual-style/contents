A **reversible garment** is a garment that can be worn two ways. There
is no true "[inside out](wikt:inside_out "wikilink")" to a reversible
garment, since either way, it gives a fashionable appearance.[1]
Garments that are commonly made reversible include
[hats](hat "wikilink"), [jackets](jacket "wikilink"),
[vests](vest "wikilink"), [sweaters](sweater "wikilink"),
[shirts](shirt "wikilink"), [trousers](trousers "wikilink"), and
[skirts](skirt "wikilink").[2][3]

Reversible garments have some features unlike other types of garments,
such as thicker overall fabric (since two fabric are often sewn
together), [buttons](button "wikilink") on both sides (in garments that
have buttons), different types of stitching, and no tags.[4][5]

Ancient [shepherds](shepherd "wikilink") used to have reversible
garments with a warm side that they would wear when the weather was
cold, and a cool side when the weather was hot.[6]
