![](Safari-Jacket.JPG "fig:Safari-Jacket.JPG") A **safari jacket** or
**bush jacket** is a garment originally designed for the purpose of
going on [safari](safari "wikilink") in the [African](Africa "wikilink")
bush. When paired with trousers or shorts, it becomes a safari suit.[1]
A safari jacket is commonly a lightweight [cotton](cotton "wikilink")
[drill](drill_(fabric) "wikilink") or lighter
[poplin](poplin "wikilink") jacket, traditionally
[khaki](khaki "wikilink") in color, with a self-belt, epaulets, four or
more expandable bellows pockets and often with cartridge loops.

## History

![](Sah-m43.jpg "fig:Sah-m43.jpg") Lightweight, light-coloured uniforms
were worn by European soldiers serving in warm climates from the 19th
century and, little altered, throughout World War II.[2] They typically
featured [epaulettes](epaulette "wikilink"), pleated pockets, belts and
other features later found on safari jackets.

The earliest reference to a 'safari suit' listed in *The Oxford English
Dictionary*[3] is from an American newspaper in 1935. In 1936, author
and adventurer [Ernest Hemingway](Ernest_Hemingway "wikilink") designed
a 'bush jacket' which was made by [Willis & Geiger
Outfitters](Willis_&_Geiger_Outfitters "wikilink"). In 1939,
[Abercrombie & Fitch](Abercrombie_&_Fitch "wikilink") advertised safari
jackets, shorts and trousers, of 'coat shirt style' for sports and
leisure wear.[4]

In the 1960s and 1970s safari suits became fashionable thanks to
designer versions for men and women by, for example, French designers
[Ted Lapidus](Ted_Lapidus "wikilink") and [Yves Saint
Laurent](Yves_Saint_Laurent_(designer) "wikilink"), both of whom are
among those credited with inventing and popularising the look.[5][6]

## Australia

(Ayers Rock), Australia, March 1983\]\] The safari suit is popularly
associated with Australian fashion in the 1970s. It was commonly worn by
the former [South Australian
Premier](Premier_of_South_Australia "wikilink") [Don
Dunstan](Don_Dunstan "wikilink").[7]

On 7 March 1974, male politicians in the [Northern
Territory](Northern_Territory "wikilink") were given permission by the
Speaker of the House [Les MacFarlane](Les_MacFarlane "wikilink") to wear
safari suits during sittings of the [Northern Territory Legislative
Assembly](Northern_Territory_Legislative_Assembly "wikilink"). It was
granted at the request of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr [Jon
Isaacs](Jon_Isaacs "wikilink"). The Speaker of the House said:

> Honourable members, I have received a further request that the
> standard of male dress be relaxed to include safari jackets. I have
> been in touch with the [federal
> parliament](Parliament_of_Australia "wikilink") and I find that the
> Speaker, [Sir Billy Snedden](Billy_Snedden "wikilink"), is allowing
> safari jackets with shirt and tie. He also allows one member to wear a
> safari jacket over an open-necked shirt. Therefore, I have decided to
> accept safari jackets as suitable dress in the Assembly. I must say
> that I do this very reluctantly because I feel that we have relaxed
> our standards too far. However, the precedent has been set. I might
> add that I will not allow T-shirts.

[Charles, Prince of Wales](Charles,_Prince_of_Wales "wikilink") famously
wore a safari suit on his visit to [Uluru](Uluru "wikilink") with
[Diana, Princess of Wales](Diana,_Princess_of_Wales "wikilink") in 1983.

## India

![](Soviet_Summer_Afghanka.jpg "fig:Soviet_Summer_Afghanka.jpg") field
uniform (safari suit).\]\] In India, the safari suit gained popularity
through the 1970s influenced to a large degree by films ([James
Bond](James_Bond "wikilink")/[Roger Moore](Roger_Moore "wikilink")) and
some fashions trends from the west for warmer climates. The safari suit
in India gained prominence when local synthetic fibre manufacture and
supply was significantly increased in the later half of the 1970s.

[Reliance Industries](Reliance_Industries "wikilink") and other textile
manufactures set up synthetic fibre plants in India significantly
reducing the price of synthetic fibre and the Indian middle class jumped
at the opportunity to be well dressed in a fabric which though unsuited
to India's climate was fairly cheap, easy to maintain and
long-lasting.[8] The safari suit continued to be the de facto business
attire, particularly in government/public sectors and the SMB arena in
India, through the late-1990s. With India's growth over the 1990s,
liberalization and with the middle class suddenly having more disposable
income, the younger generations began to gravitate towards more modern
western fashions such as suits and other business attire. Although it is
still visible in some parts of India, the Safari suit is now indelibly
associated with the so-called License Raj - the slow, inefficient Indian
bureaucracy of the 1970s and the 1980s.

## In popular culture

[Roger Moore](Roger_Moore "wikilink")'s [James
Bond](James_Bond_(character) "wikilink") wore beige safari jackets or
bush shirts with matching pants in *[The Man with the Golden
Gun](The_Man_with_the_Golden_Gun_(film) "wikilink")*,
*[Moonraker](Moonraker_(film) "wikilink")* and
*[Octopussy](Octopussy "wikilink")*. The safari jacket was a favourite
of [J. R. Ewing](J._R._Ewing "wikilink") in the 1980s evening soap opera
*[Dallas](Dallas_(1978_TV_series) "wikilink")*[9] where he usually wore
it with an [ascot](Ascot_tie "wikilink"). The Marvel Comics superhero
[Wonder Man](Wonder_Man "wikilink") wore a red safari jacket with black
pants as his costume for a period of time. In the [J.G.
Ballard](J.G._Ballard "wikilink") novel *[High
Rise](High_Rise_(novel) "wikilink")*, the character Anthony Royal wears
a white safari jacket.

Throughout [Sub-Saharan Africa](Sub-Saharan_Africa "wikilink"), the
safari suit is commonly referred to as "Kaunda suit", since Zambia's
longterm president [Kenneth Kaunda](Kenneth_Kaunda "wikilink") was known
to wear it constantly.

[Professor Elemental](Professor_Elemental "wikilink") commonly wears a
safari jacket due to the fact that he is a
[steampunk](steampunk "wikilink") [aristocrat](aristocrat "wikilink").

## Revival

Beginning in the [mid 2010s](2010s_fashion "wikilink"), a variant of the
bush jacket, known as a shirt jacket or *shacket*, underwent a revival
in the UK and Europe due to the popularisation of vintage
[workwear](workwear "wikilink") by the [hipster
subculture](hipster_subculture "wikilink").[10] These were frequently
made from blue [denim](denim "wikilink"), [cambric](cambric "wikilink"),
[seersucker](seersucker "wikilink"), heavy cotton in olive green or
[khaki](khaki "wikilink"), natural linen, or camouflage cloth, and
featured [patch pockets](patch_pocket "wikilink").[11] Some had the
[epaulets](epaulet "wikilink"), belt and pocket flaps of the traditional
safari jacket, while others did not.[12]
