The **shell jacket** is a [garment](jacket "wikilink") used as part of a
[military uniform](military_uniform "wikilink").[1] It is a short jacket
that reaches down to hip level.[2] It was very common in the mid and
late 19th century. The jacket was first created in
[Austria](Austria "wikilink").

The shell jacket was first introduced to European armies toward the end
of the 18th Century. Up to then, soldiers, infantry, cavalry and
artillery had worn open dress uniform coats with turn-back lapels over
either coloured or white sleeved-waistcoats and breeches. The advent of
closed uniform [coatees](coatee "wikilink"), i.e. waist- length jackets
with standing collars and tails, buttoned from throat to waist, meant
that sleeved waistcoats could not be worn underneath and therefore fell
redundant. However, in order to save damage or staining to dress coatees
while on [fatigue duties](fatigue_duty "wikilink"), etc., a new,
relatively plain coloured waist-length jacket was introduced. The term
“shell” jacket is of British origin, appearing during the 1790s, when
Light Dragoons adopted a dark blue short jacket with a decorative
sleeveless over- jacket, or “shell” on top. Though short-lived, the name
stuck and was later to be applied to short, sleeved fatigue jackets from
about 1800. Through the British Army adopted coloured shell jackets (red
for infantry and heavy cavalry, dark blue for artillery and light
cavalry), Foot-Guards and Highland regiments adopted a white
shell-jacket, referred to as a sleeved-waistcoat. During the first half
of the 19th Century, the British Army wore dress coatees in battle
against European or American enemies, but tended to wear shell jackets
on colonial campaigns. However, the shell jacket was discontinued by the
British in the 1870s (other than by certain cavalry regiments) in favour
of a second, plainer skirted tunic. Guards and Highland regiments
continued to wear white shell jackets for “walking out” until 1914.

The shell jacket became regulation for the US army in 1833, replacing
the [Napoleonic](Napoleon "wikilink")-era blue
[tailcoat](tailcoat "wikilink"). Infantry jackets were sky blue with
white piping and silver buttons. Cavalry uniforms were navy blue with
orange (later yellow) piping and artillery uniforms were identical but
with red piping; they had brass rather than silver buttons. The infantry
uniform was worn during the Mexican War until 1851 when it was replaced
with the dark blue frock coat with sky blue piping. Trousers with a fly
front replaced the older-style flap-front design and
[kepis](kepi "wikilink") and [Hardee hats](Hardee_hat "wikilink")
replaced the M1839 [Wheel Cap](forage_cap "wikilink"). Cavalry and
artillery shell jackets remained in use until after the [American Civil
War](American_Civil_War "wikilink") as they were more practical for
mounted troops than the long frock (which was briefly introduced in 1851
but rejected).[3]

The [Confederate States of
America](Confederate_States_of_America "wikilink") adopted the jacket in
1861; the most famous are the [Richmond
Depot](Richmond_Depot "wikilink")'s, RDI, RDII, and RDIII.
[Columbus](Columbus,_Georgia "wikilink") Depot, Department of
[Alabama](Alabama "wikilink"), and [Atlanta](Atlanta "wikilink") Depot
also were common famous suppliers. See [uniforms of the Confederate
States military
forces](uniforms_of_the_Confederate_States_military_forces "wikilink")
for more information.

During [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), [Dwight D.
Eisenhower](Dwight_D._Eisenhower "wikilink") popularised a waist-length
jacket based on British [Battle Dress](Battle_Dress "wikilink"). This
was known as an Ike Jacket and after the war was adopted as a uniform by
many US police forces. Blue [denim](denim "wikilink") versions became
popular among urban workers, [cowboys](cowboy "wikilink"), [truck
drivers](truck_driver "wikilink") and teenagers. Today these jackets
(often with patches, studs and badges added) are popular among
[bikers](motorcycling "wikilink"),
[greasers](Greaser_(subculture) "wikilink"),
[metalheads](Heavy_metal_subculture "wikilink") and
[punks](punk_subculture "wikilink"). In addition it plays a minor role
in mainstream [European](Europe "wikilink") fashion.
