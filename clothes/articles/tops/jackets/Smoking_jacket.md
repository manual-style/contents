*[Gaslight](Gaslight_(1944_film) "wikilink")*.\]\] A **smoking jacket**
is a [menswear](menswear "wikilink") over[garment](garment "wikilink")
typically in a [lounge jacket](lounge_jacket "wikilink") cut originally
designed in the 1850s to be worn while smoking
[tobacco](tobacco "wikilink"), usually in the form of
[pipes](smoking_pipe_(tobacco) "wikilink") and
[cigars](cigar "wikilink").

From 1865, the [dinner jacket](dinner_jacket "wikilink") evolved out of
the smoking jacket – essentially a [dress coat](dress_coat "wikilink")
without [tail](tailcoat "wikilink") – following the example of the then
Prince, later King [Edward VII](Edward_VII "wikilink") (1841–1910).

## Etymology

The smoking jacket had its name after its associated
[tobacco](tobacco "wikilink") activity.

As a [false friend](false_friend "wikilink"), the name carried on to its
derivation the [dinner jacket](dinner_jacket "wikilink") in several
non-English languages. In Bulgarian, Catalan, Czech, Danish, Dutch,
French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Polish,
Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and other European
languages, the term *smoking* indicates a dinner jacket, that is a
tuxedo.

[classic](classic "wikilink")-styled smoking jacket is a mid
thigh-length [lounge jacket](lounge_jacket "wikilink")-sized overgarment
made from [velvet](velvet "wikilink"), [silk](silk "wikilink"), or both.
It typically comes in a [shawl collar](shawl_collar "wikilink"), turn-up
[cuffs](cuff "wikilink") and toggle or [button](button "wikilink")
fastenings, or may simply be closed with a tie belt.

In the 1850s, the *[Gentlemen's
Magazine](Gentlemen's_Magazine "wikilink") of London* defined the
smoking jacket as a "kind of short [robe de
chambre](Banyan_(clothing) "wikilink"), of velvet, cashmere, plush,
merino or printed flannel, lined with bright colours, ornamented with
brandebourgs \[i.e. [frogs](Frog_(fastening) "wikilink")\], olives or
large buttons."[1]

(1818–1896) wearing a smoking jacket in 1868.\]\]

### Origins

In the 17th century, goods began flowing into
[Europe](Europe "wikilink") from [Asia](Asia "wikilink") and the
[Americas](Americas "wikilink"), bringing in [spices](spice "wikilink"),
[tobacco](tobacco "wikilink"), [coffee](coffee "wikilink"), and
[silks](silk "wikilink"). It became fashionable to be depicted in one's
portrait wearing a silk *robe de chambre*, or [dressing
gown](dressing_gown "wikilink"). One of the earliest mentions of this
garment comes from [Samuel Pepys](Samuel_Pepys "wikilink"), who desired
to be depicted in his portrait in a silk gown but could not afford one,
so he rented one:

> Thence home and eat one mouthful, and so to Hale's and there sat until
> almost quite dark upon working my gowne, which I hired to be drawn
> (in) it—an Indian gown, and I do see all the reason to expect a most
> excellent picture of it. —*Diary*, 30 March 1666[2]

In the 18th century, gentlemen often referred to a specific style of
"night gown" called the [banyan](Banyan_(clothing) "wikilink"), a
knee-length robe, a more comfortable in design than the
[justaucorps](justaucorps "wikilink"), onto which [shawl
collars](shawl_collar "wikilink") became recurrent.

### 19th century

The short smoking jacket soon evolved from these silk garments. When the
[Crimean War](Crimean_War "wikilink") during the 1850s popularised
[Turkish tobacco](Turkish_tobacco "wikilink") in Britain, smoking gained
in popularity. After dinner, a gentleman might put on a smoking jacket
and retreat to a [smoking room](smoking_room "wikilink") (akin to a
[den](Den_(room) "wikilink") or "[mancave](mancave "wikilink")"). The
jacket was intended to absorb the smoke from his cigar or pipe and
protect his clothing from falling ash.[3]

### 20th century

puppy (1930).\]\] The smoking jacket remained a popular accessory into
the 20th century. An editorial in *[The Washington
Post](The_Washington_Post "wikilink")* in 1902 gave the opinion that the
smoking jacket was "synonymous with comfort",[4] while a Pennsylvania
newspaper opined in 1908 that it would be "putting it mildly to say that
a new House Coat or Smoking Jacket will give any man reason for
elation".[5] Famous wearers included [Fred
Astaire](Fred_Astaire "wikilink") (who was buried in a smoking jacket),
[Cary Grant](Cary_Grant "wikilink"), [Dean
Martin](Dean_Martin "wikilink"), [Jon Pertwee](Jon_Pertwee "wikilink")
and [Frank Sinatra](Frank_Sinatra "wikilink").[6]

While smoking jackets declined in popularity from the 1950s, a minority
of wearers still persisted; *[Playboy](Playboy "wikilink")* mogul [Hugh
Hefner](Hugh_Hefner "wikilink") (1926–2017) was a notable example. In
its January/February 1999 issue, *[Cigar
Aficionado](Cigar_Aficionado "wikilink")* stated that it was time the
smoking jacket be brought back, perhaps as an "alternative type of
[formalwear](formal_wear "wikilink")".[7]
