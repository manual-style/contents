The **spencer**, dating from the 1790s, was originally a woolen outer
[tail-coat](tail-coat "wikilink") with the tails omitted. It was worn as
a short waist-length, double-breasted, man's
[jacket](jacket "wikilink"). It was originally named for [George
Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer](George_Spencer,_2nd_Earl_Spencer "wikilink")
(1758–1834), who is reported to have had a tail-coat adapted after its
tails were burned by coals from a fire.[1] It was adopted as [mess
dress](mess_dress "wikilink") by British military officers, leading to
the name [mess jacket](mess_jacket "wikilink").

It was also soon adopted as a popular women's fashion on both sides of
the Atlantic during the 1790–1820 [Regency style
period](Regency_fashion "wikilink")[2][3][4] The spencer was worn as a
[cardigan](cardigan_(sweater) "wikilink"), or as a short, fitted jacket
cut to just above waist level, or, in
[Empire](Empire_silhouette "wikilink") style, to the bust line, and
tailored on identical lines to the dress.[5]

The use of the term spencer continued well into the 19th century to mean
more generally any type of short jacket or coat. In Australia, New
Zealand and South Africa the term is sometimes used to refer to thermal
underwear.[6]

In current menswear, the term "spencer" is often synonymous with knitted
vest or waistcoat.
