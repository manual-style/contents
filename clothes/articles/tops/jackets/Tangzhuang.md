A **tangzhuang** is a kind of Chinese [jacket](jacket "wikilink") with a
[straight collar](Mandarin_collar "wikilink"). It is an updated form of
the [Qing](Qing_Empire "wikilink") [magua](Magua_(clothing) "wikilink"),
itself a more fashionable adaptation of the riding jacket once worn by
[Manchu](Manchu_people "wikilink") horsemen.

## Name

*Tángzhuāng* is the [pinyin](pinyin "wikilink")
[romanization](romanization_of_Chinese "wikilink") of the
[Mandarin](standard_Mandarin "wikilink") pronunciation of the clothes'
[Chinese](Chinese_language "wikilink") name, written as in [traditional
characters](traditional_characters "wikilink") and as in the [simplified
characters](simplified_characters "wikilink") now used in [mainland
China](mainland_China "wikilink"). Its spelling may vary a little in
other romanizations or [dialects](dialects_of_Chinese "wikilink"). It is
also sometimes translated as a or **jacket**.[1]

Although the name of the jacket in English *and* Chinese suggests an
origin during (or at least reference to) the
[Tang](Tang_dynasty "wikilink") period of [Chinese
history](Chinese_history "wikilink"), it was actually intended by its
designers to mean a "Chinese" outfit.[2] In [southern
China](southern_China "wikilink") and among the [Chinese
diaspora](Chinese_diaspora "wikilink"), dialects like
[Cantonese](Cantonese "wikilink") refer to [ethnic
Chinese](ethnic_Chinese "wikilink")—as opposed to all [Chinese
nationals](People's_Republic_of_China "wikilink")—as "[Tang
people](Han_Chinese#Names "wikilink")" rather than
"[Han](Han_Chinese "wikilink")". It is thus also sometimes translated as
a After criticism of the misleading name appeared in various Chinese
media, some of its designers and some government officials began to call
the garment the "new tangzhuang"[3] or but neither name lasted.[4]
Instead, most Chinese people came to accept the designers' original name
for the garment and some even expanded it to describe any form of
[traditional Chinese
clothing](traditional_Chinese_clothing "wikilink").[5]

## History

### Magua

![](Delaval_Portrait_of_Kan_Gao.jpg "fig:Delaval_Portrait_of_Kan_Gao.jpg")'s
1821 portrait of Kan Gao, a Chinese worker on
[Cayenne](Cayenne "wikilink"), in a
[magua](magua_(clothing) "wikilink").\]\] The tangzhuang is an adaption
of the [Manchu](Manchu_people "wikilink") "[horse
jacket](magua_(clothing) "wikilink")" (*magua*),[6] a
[waist](waist "wikilink")- or three-quarter-length[7] front-opening
[jacket](jacket "wikilink") or [surcoat](surcoat "wikilink").[8] This
was initially worn—usually in a dark blue color—by Manchu horsemen, but
became mandatory for [Han](Han_Chinese "wikilink")
[officials](scholar-bureaucrat "wikilink")' clothing under the [Qing
Empire](Qing_Empire "wikilink").[9] Over time, it evolved from a
protective apron for the [changshan](changshan "wikilink") into an item
of [Chinese fashion](Chinese_fashion "wikilink") in its own right and
even [a mark of imperial favor](imperial_yellow_jacket "wikilink"). Its
use then spread among the common Han,[10] including among the [Chinese
diaspora](Chinese_diaspora "wikilink") abroad.

Following the 1911 [Xinhai Revolution](Xinhai_Revolution "wikilink") and
1949 [Communist](Chinese_Communist_Party "wikilink") victory in the
[Chinese Civil War](Chinese_Civil_War "wikilink"), the "[Mao
suit](Mao_suit "wikilink")" (*[Zhōngshān](Sun_Yat-sen "wikilink")
zhuāng*) gradually displaced the changshan and magua in most contexts.
After the fall of the [Gang of Four](Gang_of_Four "wikilink") in the
late 1970s and the beginning of [Deng
Xiaoping](Deng_Xiaoping "wikilink")'s [Opening Up
Policy](Opening_Up_Policy "wikilink") in the 1980s, traditional clothing
began to experience a revival in [mainland
China](mainland_China "wikilink"). Variants of the magua became
noticeably more common in Chinese fashion from the mid-1990s.[11]

### 2001 APEC Summit

![](Vladimir_Putin_at_APEC_Summit_in_China_19-21_October_2001-13.jpg "fig:Vladimir_Putin_at_APEC_Summit_in_China_19-21_October_2001-13.jpg")n
and [US](United_States_of_America "wikilink") presidents [Vladimir
Putin](Vladimir_Putin "wikilink") and [George W.
Bush](George_W._Bush "wikilink") in their tangzhuangs at the [2001 APEC
summit](2001_APEC_summit "wikilink") in [Shanghai](Shanghai "wikilink"),
[China](China "wikilink")\]\] In 1993, US
[president](president_of_the_United_States "wikilink") [Bill
Clinton](Bill_Clinton "wikilink") tried to bring [trade
talks](trade_agreement "wikilink") back on track by inviting the
[heads](heads_of_state "wikilink") of the [APEC](APEC "wikilink") member
economies to personally attend what had until then been a ministerial
conference. He requested leaders' clothes remain informal and presented
each with a leather [bomber jacket](bomber_jacket "wikilink") bearing
the APEC logo as a memento. The next year,
[Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink") followed suit and presented [batik
shirts](batik_shirt "wikilink"); the world leaders then humored
[Suharto](Suharto "wikilink")'s request that they wear them for a group
photo.[12] The tradition developed that the summits' hosts would present
traditional and representative clothes from their cultures,[13] and the
leaders would wear them on the last day of the conference as a show of
solidarity.[14]

Ahead of the first occasion of [China's hosting the summit in
2001](2001_APEC_summit "wikilink"), [state-run
media](state-run_media "wikilink") acquainted the Chinese with the
custom, prompting speculation as to what China's "traditional clothes"
might be:[15] [Mao suits](Mao_suits "wikilink") had been displaced by
[western-style suits](Suit_(clothing) "wikilink"); [minority
groups](minorities_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China "wikilink") often
had recognizable ethnic costumes but styles of [Han
clothing](hanfu "wikilink") (*hànfú*) had varied from dynasty to
dynasty, with the most recent [Qing](Qing_dynasty "wikilink") forms
heavily influenced by the [Manchus](Manchu_people "wikilink") and their
oppressive dress codes. Although these designs were among the 40[16]
presented to the Chinese government over the span of a year,[17] their
foreign origin or political connotations[18] led officials to select an
"ambiguously traditional"[19] design by Shanghainese clothiers [Li
Jianqin](Li_Jianqin "wikilink")[20] (, *Lǐ Jiànqín*) and [Yu
Ying](Yu_Ying "wikilink")
(<small>[t](traditional_characters "wikilink")</small>
<small>[s](simplified_characters "wikilink")</small> *Yú Yīng*) and by
five others at [Qinyi](Qinyi "wikilink")
(<small>[t](traditional_characters "wikilink")</small>
<small>[s](simplified_characters "wikilink")</small> *Qínyì Fúshì*)[21]
and the [Shanghai Garment Group](Shanghai_Garment_Group "wikilink")

![](Manuel_Joseph_2005.jpg "fig:Manuel_Joseph_2005.jpg") practitioners,
clad in white tangzhuangs <small>(2005)</small>\]\] The jackets given to
the APEC leaders were a blend of Chinese motifs and western design, made
from [silk](silk "wikilink") supposedly artificially enhanced to be
stronger, softer, more
[wrinkle-resistant](wrinkle-resistant_fabric "wikilink"), more
[water-absorbent](water_absorption "wikilink"), and better ventilated,
with longer-lasting and brighter colors.[25] They featured [cotton
knotwork](Chinese_button_knot "wikilink") instead of buttons and a
design of [peonies](peonies "wikilink") surrounding the letters
"APEC".[26] The jackets were handmade[27] but not [personally
sized](Bespoke_tailoring "wikilink"); instead, they were fitted using
stand-ins and body doubles, with a partially-completed backup available
in case those measurements were mistaken.[28] The leaders had a choice
among [scarlet](scarlet_(color) "wikilink"),
[azure](Tang_blue "wikilink"),
[green](Shades_of_green#Green_(CMYK)_(pigment_green) "wikilink"),
[brown](brown_(color) "wikilink"),
[maroon](maroon_(color) "wikilink"),[29] and
[black](black_(color) "wikilink") versions;[30][31] each came in a
matching silk bag adorned with the APEC logo and each had an
off-white[32] silk shirt to wear beneath it.[33] The 20 attendees—the
leaders of all the APEC member economies except "[Chinese
Taipei](Chinese_Taipei "wikilink")"—mostly opted for the red-and-black
or blue-and-gold design[34] and wore the jackets to their meetings at
the [Shanghai Science and Technology
Museum](Shanghai_Science_and_Technology_Museum "wikilink") on 21 October
2001 and for the "Leaders' Family Portrait" afterwards that closed the
event.[35]

### Tangzhuang craze

The tangzhuang's use as the representative [unisex](unisex "wikilink")
[Chinese clothing](Chinese_clothing "wikilink") for the "Leaders' Family
Portrait" immediately[36] led to its more widespread
popularity,[37][38][39] spreading from Beijing to other large towns
around the country as far afield as [Lanzhou](Lanzhou "wikilink") in
[Gansu](Gansu "wikilink") by the next [Chinese New
Year](Chinese_New_Year "wikilink").[40] This "tangzhuang craze"
(<small>[t](traditional_characters "wikilink")</small>
<small>[s](simplified_characters "wikilink")</small> *tángzhuāng rè*)
saw the tangzhuang and other traditional clothes become
[fashionable](Chinese_fashion "wikilink") [daily
wear](daily_wear "wikilink") for both sexes, which gave a large boost to
the [domestic silk industry](Chinese_silk "wikilink"). The original
designers left their original companies to start their own businesses to
capitalize on their creation's popularity,[41] but the fad was
short-lived[42] and most had moved on by 2004.[43]

### Subsequent history

![](Jefa_de_Estado_participa_de_la_fotografía_oficial_de_Líderes_APEC_(15758575652)_(2).jpg "fig:Jefa_de_Estado_participa_de_la_fotografía_oficial_de_Líderes_APEC_(15758575652)_(2).jpg"),
[Vladimir Putin](Vladimir_Putin "wikilink"), and others in the 2014
version of the tangzhuang\]\]
![](Regina_Ip_at_VP_New_Year_Fair_2009.jpg "fig:Regina_Ip_at_VP_New_Year_Fair_2009.jpg")
[politician](politics_of_Hong_Kong "wikilink") [Regina
Ip](Regina_Ip "wikilink") at the [Chinese New
Year](Chinese_New_Year "wikilink") fair in [Victoria
Park](Victoria_Park,_Hong_Kong "wikilink") <small>(2009)</small>\]\]
Even after the end of its fad, the tangzhuang continues to have a place
in [Chinese fashion](Chinese_fashion "wikilink"). It remained in common
use among [Jiang Zemin](Jiang_Zemin "wikilink")'s
[clique](Shanghai_clique "wikilink") and the [nouveau
riche](tuhao "wikilink"), but more especially became a
[menswear](menswear "wikilink") staple on the mainland and abroad for
[traditional Chinese
holidays](traditional_Chinese_holidays "wikilink")[44][45] alongside
western and [Mao-style suits](Mao_suit "wikilink").[46]

The tangzhuang—and its perceived inauthenticity as ethnic clothing—is
also credited by members of the [hanfu
movement](hanfu_movement "wikilink") with having inspired their cause
and a revival of [actual traditional Han clothing](hanfu "wikilink"),
despite the Chinese public's usual confusion about its origin.[47]
(Traditional Chinese fashions have been so long mixed with Manchu and
western elements that Tang-style robes are confused with
[Japanese](Japanese_clothing "wikilink") [kimonos](kimono "wikilink")
and Ming clothes with [Korean](Korean_clothes "wikilink")
[hanboks](hanbok "wikilink").)[48]

China used the "Tang suit jackets" again for its [2014 APEC
summit](2014_APEC_summit "wikilink"), but with an updated style in
[maroon](maroon_(color) "wikilink"), green, and blue that *The Guardian*
unflatteringly compared to *[Star Trek](Star_Trek "wikilink")*
uniforms.[49]

## Style

![](Chinese_beautiful_girl.jpg "fig:Chinese_beautiful_girl.jpg") The
APEC jackets were intended to reflect "both traditional Chinese flavor
and modern ideals".[50] They have straight [Mandarin
collars](Mandarin_collar "wikilink"), similar to those on the
[changshan](changshan "wikilink") and
[magua](magua_(clothing) "wikilink") that gave the style its name.
Unlike the traditional 2D "flat-cutting" *píngmiàn cáijiǎn*) process
used to create those garments, which tends to produce a baggy and
ill-fitted look, tangzhuangs are made using the 3D "solid-cutting"
(<small>[t](traditional_characters "wikilink")</small>
<small>[s](simplified_characters "wikilink")</small> *lìtǐ cáijiǎn*)
process developed in Europe. In particular, they employ
[draping](Drape_suit "wikilink"), [darts](Dart_(sewing) "wikilink"), and
[set-in sleeves](set-in_sleeves "wikilink") cut separately from the rest
of the main garment, which give them a more fitted look than traditional
Chinese designs.[51] The original version also employed [shoulder
pads](shoulder_pads "wikilink") to give a stronger silhouette.[52]

Although the APEC jackets were pointedly made using artificial
fibers,[53] [silk](silk "wikilink") tangzhuang have since outsold those
made from [cotton](cotton "wikilink") and other materials. Tangzhuang
are available in a variety of colors, although the most common are red
or blue.[54][55] The [brocade](brocade "wikilink") is often decorated
with a repeated pattern of [embroidery](embroidery "wikilink"). Common
designs involve the repetition of auspicious [Chinese
characters](Chinese_character "wikilink") such as
*[fú](Fu_(character) "wikilink")* (, "happiness") or
*[shòu](Shou_(character) "wikilink")*
(<small>[t](traditional_characters "wikilink")</small>,
<small>[s](simplified_characters "wikilink")</small>,
"[longevity](longevity "wikilink")") for [good
luck](good_luck "wikilink") and good wishes.[56] Tangzhuang are usually
fastened with [decorative knotwork](Chinese_button_knot "wikilink")
instead of [buttons](button "wikilink").

Tangzhuang are usually considered [menswear](menswear "wikilink") but
they may also be [worn by women](Women's_clothing_in_China "wikilink"),
as by [New Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink")'s [prime
minister](prime_minister_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") [Helen
Clark](Helen_Clark "wikilink") at [APEC 2001](APEC_2001 "wikilink").[57]
