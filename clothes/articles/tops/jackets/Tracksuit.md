A **tracksuit** is an article of [clothing](clothing "wikilink")
consisting of two parts: [trousers](trousers "wikilink") and a
[jacket](jacket "wikilink") usually with front
[zipper](zipper "wikilink"). It was originally intended for use in
[sports](sport "wikilink"), mainly for athletes to wear over competition
clothing (such as running [shirt](shirt "wikilink") and
[shorts](shorts "wikilink") or a [swimsuit](swimsuit "wikilink")) and to
take off before competition. In modern times, it has become commonly
worn in other contexts. The tracksuit was one of the earliest uses of
synthetic fibers in sportswear.[1]

A descendant of the tracksuit, the **shell suit**, which arrived in the
late 1980s, was popular with the hip hop and breakdancing scene of the
era.[2] They were manufactured from a mix of [cellulose
triacetate](cellulose_triacetate "wikilink") and
[polyester](polyester "wikilink") making them shiny on the outside, with
distinctive combinations of colours.[3]

Most tracksuits have a mesh interior which allows the user to wear them
without any undergarment such as underwear. This is much like a bathing
suit. Many people wear it for [physical
exercise](physical_exercise "wikilink") sessions. A [sauna
suit](sauna_suit "wikilink") is a specialized form of tracksuit made of
a waterproof fabric such as coated nylon or PVC that is designed to make
the wearer sweat profusely. Sauna suits are primarily used for temporary
weight loss.

The tracksuit is also known as a **warm-up suit**, or **"warmups"** for
short, as they are intended for athletes to keep their bodies warm
before or after competition, and during breaks (especially important in
cold weather). In almost all cases, sports teams will wear these
garments using a fabric that matches their official team, school, or
country colors. The bottoms of tracksuits are also known as
[sweatpants](sweatpants "wikilink").

## Fashion history

Tracksuits have come in and out of fashion over several decades. The
period that featured tracksuits as sportswear that was acceptable to
wear outside of the gym was the 1960s and 1970s. Tracksuits first became
popular around 1975, made out of cotton, polyester, terry cloth, or a
mix. In the late 1970s velour became popular, so much so that it became
the most used form of fabric on a tracksuit. The trend of wearing
athletic clothing continued into the early 1980s. Tracksuits were
eventually replaced by shellsuits, which were made out of nylon, in the
late 1980s. This trend was short-lived, lasting only a few years.

In the late 1990s, tracksuits made a comeback in mainstream fashion for
both men and women. They returned to the fabrics of the 1970s, most
notably polyester. The return of tracksuits can largely be credited to
music, most notably Rapper [Jay Z](Jay_Z "wikilink") and Spice Girl
[Sporty Spice](Sporty_Spice "wikilink"). The trend continued into the
2000s, where velour made a comeback, by the likes of [Juicy
Couture](Juicy_Couture "wikilink") and other brands. This continued for
most of the decade. Tracksuits briefly went out of fashion in the late
2000s, resurfacing in the 2010s with
"[athleisure](athleisure "wikilink")" trends.[4][5]

Since 2006, prominent fashion designers have been asked to design
tracksuits for the athletes of various
[Olympic](Olympic_games "wikilink") teams, usually all the athletes
representing one country. For example, designer [Ralph
Lauren](Ralph_Lauren "wikilink") created the USA uniforms for the 2010
[Winter Olympic Games](Winter_Olympic_Games "wikilink") opening
ceremony.[6] The sportswear company [Adidas](Adidas "wikilink") hired
Stella McCartney to be the Creative Director for the 2012 GB Olympic
Games (by Adidas)—the first time in the history of the games that a
leading fashion designer has designed the apparel for a particular
country’s team across all competitions for both the Olympic and the
Paralympic Games.[7]
