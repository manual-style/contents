A **Waxed jacket** is a type of hip-length
[raincoat](raincoat "wikilink") made from [waxed
cotton](waxed_cotton "wikilink") cloth, iconic of
[British](United_Kingdom "wikilink") and [Irish](Ireland "wikilink")
country life. Today it is commonly worn for outdoor rural pursuits such
as [hunting](hunting "wikilink"), [shooting](shooting "wikilink") and
[fishing](fishing "wikilink"). It is a [cotton](cotton "wikilink")
jacket made water-resistant by a
[paraffin](Paraffin_wax "wikilink")-based [waxing](wax "wikilink"),
typically with a [tartan](tartan "wikilink")
[lining](lining_(sewing) "wikilink") and a
[corduroy](corduroy "wikilink") or [leather](leather "wikilink") collar.
The main drawback of a waxed fabric is its lack of
[breathability](Breathable_fabric "wikilink").[1]

Its origin of the waxed jacket is in the coated garments also known as
[oilskin](oilskin "wikilink").[2]
