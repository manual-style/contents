A **windbreaker**, or a **windcheater**, is a thin fabric
[jacket](jacket "wikilink") designed to resist [wind
chill](wind_chill "wikilink") and light [rain](rain "wikilink"), making
it a lighter version of the [jacket](jacket "wikilink"). It is usually
of lightweight construction and characteristically made of a [synthetic
material](synthetic_fiber "wikilink"). A windbreaker often uses [elastic
waistbands](elastic_waistband "wikilink"), and/or
[armbands](armbands "wikilink"), and a [zipper](zipper "wikilink") to
allow adjustments for the current [weather
conditions](weather_conditions "wikilink").

Regular jackets, coats, etc. may include a type of windbreaker as an
interlining that can be removed when desired. Windbreakers sometimes
include a hood that may be removable and/or stowable. Many windbreakers
may also include large pockets on the inside or the outside which allows
belongings to be covered from weather such as light wind or rain as
mentioned above. Windbreakers offer *light to moderate* [insulating
protection](Thermal_insulation "wikilink"), more so than a
[sweater](sweater "wikilink"), but less than an
[overcoat](overcoat "wikilink").[1]

Windbreakers are primarily worn during the [warmer
seasons](Summer "wikilink") when wind or rain are expected, or as part
of a [layering](Layering_(clothing) "wikilink") strategy during [colder
seasons](Winter "wikilink").[2] Brightly colored windbreakers may also
be worn by runners as protection from the weather, and as a reflective
garment used for safety. A 2012 study demonstrated that adding
windbreaker pants and jackets offer a lightweight but effective means of
delaying hypothermia if the user is outside walking and encounters
unexpected low temperatures.[3]

## Windbreaker

![](windbreaker-ad-1940.jpg "fig:windbreaker-ad-1940.jpg") company ad
for windbreaker jackets (1942)\|alt=\]\]The term *windbreaker*, used
primarily in the [United Kingdom](British_English "wikilink"), United
States and [Japan](Japan "wikilink"), is probably in the process of
becoming a [genericized trademark](genericized_trademark "wikilink"),
but it is still registered with the [U.S. Trademark
Office](U.S._Trademark_Office "wikilink"). It was first used by the John
Rissman company of [Chicago](Chicago "wikilink") for its
[gabardine](gabardine "wikilink") jackets.

*Windbreaker* is used in the [United Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink")
and certain [Commonwealth](Commonwealth_of_Nations "wikilink")
countries, including [Australia](Australia "wikilink") and
[India](India "wikilink"). It can also refer to any glossy synthetic
material used to make clothing. Windcheater tops are also commonly known
as [cagoules](cagoule "wikilink") or windbreakers in the United Kingdom.

## Windcheater

However, the term *windcheater* precedes the term *windbreaker* and was
originally used to describe a sort of garment that was more akin to a
[pullover](Pullover_(garment) "wikilink") [anorak](anorak "wikilink")
than a modern windbreaker. Unlike windbreakers, which are waist-length,
windcheaters tend to extend down to the thighs, and they lack
[quilting](quilting "wikilink") or net linings.

*Windcheater* is also used to describe a retail item used on the
[beach](beach "wikilink") and [camping](camping "wikilink") to prevent
wind from disturbing social enjoyment. Normally made from cotton, nylon,
canvas and recycled sails, these windbreaks tend to have three or more
panels held in place with poles that slide into pockets sewn into the
panel (like many [tents](Tent "wikilink")).The poles are then hammered
into the ground and a [windbreak](windbreak "wikilink") is formed.

## Windpants

The term *[windpants](windpants "wikilink")* (also known as "splash
pants" or "overtrousers") describes [pants](trousers "wikilink") made
out of a synthetic material with an [elastic
band](elastic_band "wikilink") around the waist. They are usually
lightweight and serve to shield the wearer from [wind](wind "wikilink"),
and sometimes also [mud](mud "wikilink") and [water](water "wikilink").

Windpants are almost always made out of
[polyester](polyester "wikilink") or [nylon](nylon "wikilink"). They are
sometimes worn as an outer layer on top of other clothing, and often
have zippers on each ankle so that they can be pulled over
[footwear](footwear "wikilink"). Some windpants have zippers that run
the full length of the leg so that the pants can be unzipped entirely.
