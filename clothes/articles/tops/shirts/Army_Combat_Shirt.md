The **Army Combat Shirt** (**ACS**) is a flame-resistant shirt developed
and used by the [United States Army](United_States_Army "wikilink") as a
supplementary addition to the [Army Combat
Uniform](Army_Combat_Uniform "wikilink").[1] The ACS is a stand-alone
shirt designed specifically for use with [Improved Outer Tactical
Vest](Improved_Outer_Tactical_Vest "wikilink") armor in warm and hot
weather instead of the blouse. It is intended to greatly increase user
comfort through the use of lightweight, moisture-wicking, and breathable
fabrics. The ACS was created in conjunction with the
[USMC](United_States_Marine_Corps "wikilink")'s [Flame Resistant
Organizational Gear](Flame_Resistant_Organizational_Gear "wikilink")
(FROG). The ACS, in conjunction with the Fire Resistant ACU (FRACU)
trousers, provides head-to-toe protection against burns.

## Background

Traditionally, flame-resistant uniforms have been reserved for military
personnel such as aviators, fuel handlers and combat vehicle crew who
were most likely to encounter fuel-related fires. However, the
increasing frequency of [improvised explosive
devices](improvised_explosive_devices "wikilink") in
[Afghanistan](Afghanistan "wikilink") and [Iraq](Iraq "wikilink") during
the 2000s greatly increased the number of troops in need of
flame-resistant clothing and uniforms.

### 2000s

#### 2002–2006: Development

Early prototype versions of the Army Combat Shirt were unveiled by the
Army in May 2002 as part of the Objective Force Warrior program.[2]
Updated prototypes in the [MultiCam](MultiCam "wikilink") camouflage
pattern were displayed in July 2004 at a military technology convention
held at the U.S. Capitol as a part of the [Future Force
Warrior](Future_Force_Warrior "wikilink") program.[3]

A year later in June 2005, prototypes were again displayed during a
Future Force Warrior convention at the U.S. Capitol.[4][5][6][7][8]

#### 2007: Introduction

In January 2007, the Army began shipping 160,000 flame-resistant
[Nomex](Nomex "wikilink") uniforms for soldiers assigned to at-risk
convoy operations. However, the [Nomex](Nomex "wikilink") uniforms
restricted air movement more than the traditional Cotton/Nylon ACU and
were hotter for soldiers to wear. Army equipment officials developed the
ACS to provide soldiers with a lightweight, breathable alternative to
the [Nomex](Nomex "wikilink") ACU.

### 2010s

#### 2016–2019: Ballistic Combat Shirt

Currently the U.S. Army is working on an armored variant of the Army
Combat Shirt known as the "Ballistic Combat Shirt", which adds ballistic
protection to the upper thorax, lower neck, and upper sleeve areas while
sacrificing as little arm mobility as possible.[9] This has been
desirable due to the increasing prevalence of low-profile body armor
which does not support the additional extremity protection the IBA
system does, as well as ergonomic issues with the extremity protection
that causes soldiers to choose not to use them even when wearing
compatible armor. It will begin fielding in 2019.[10][11][12]

## Overview

Initially, the torso of the shirt was foliage green with the [Army
Strong](Army_Strong "wikilink") logo centered on the chest (removed in
later versions); the arms are in the [Universal Camouflage
Pattern](Universal_Camouflage_Pattern "wikilink") similar to the [Army
Combat Uniform](Army_Combat_Uniform "wikilink"), with integrated
anti-abrasion [elbow pads](elbow_pad "wikilink"). No-seam shoulders
minimize rubbing or chafing against armor. With the adoption of the
[MultiCam](MultiCam "wikilink") uniform for wear in Afghanistan, there
is now a version made with a tan body and MultiCam sleeves. Other
features include a double pen pocket on the lower arm, zippered storage
pockets on the upper arm, concealable [infrared](infrared "wikilink")
identification tabs, and a place to attach name, rank, and flag on the
upper arm.[13] The features of both shirts are the same.

The ACS is constructed of three flame-resistant performance fabrics
proprietary to TenCate Protective Fabrics or Massif Mountain Gear
Company. The shirt’s torso is constructed of two highly breathable
flame-resistant fabrics with advanced moisture management capabilities.
Both fabrics wick moisture away from the skin and dry rapidly,
preventing the fabrics from sticking to the user’s skin and greatly
increasing comfort under body armor. The sleeves and side panels of the
shirt are constructed of a lightweight, but durable and
abrasion-resistant fabric designed to provide extra protection for areas
not protected by body armor. All three fabrics feature 4-way stretch for
enhanced performance and user comfort.
