A **blouse** ()[1] is a loose-fitting upper garment that was formerly
worn by workmen, peasants, artists, women, and children.[2] It is
typically gathered at the waist or hips (by tight hem, pleats, parter,
or belt) so that it hangs loosely ("blouses"[3]) over the wearer's
body.[4] Today, the word most commonly refers to a girl's or woman's
[dress shirt](dress_shirt "wikilink").[5] It can also refer to a man's
shirt if it is a loose-fitting style (e.g. [poet
shirts](poet_shirt "wikilink") and Cossack shirts),[6] though it rarely
is. Traditionally, the term has been used to refer to a shirt which
blouses out or has an unmistakably feminine appearance.

The term is also used for some men's military uniform jackets.[7]

## Etymology

Blouse is a loanword to English from French: *blouse* means "dust coat".
It possibly was brought back from their travels by French Crusaders.
They moved on their armor a so-called "p(e)lusisian shirt", a
blue-colored gowns to the dust, which had its name from the Egyptian
town of [Pelusium](Pelusium "wikilink"). The derivation may also be from
blouso "short (wool)" [8] ("wool", *blouso* "short wool") and\\or *blos*
"deprived, naked" taken off ([Provençal
dialect](Provençal_dialect "wikilink")). It is first officially noted in
1828, from French blouse ("a workman's or peasant's smock"), of obscure
[Occitan](Occitan "wikilink") route.

Blouses are historically a cask style, mostly mail-like garment, that
were rarely part of the fashionable woman's wardrobe until the
[1890s](1890s_in_fashion "wikilink"). Before that time, they were
occasionally popular for informal wear in styles that echoed
[peasant](peasant "wikilink") or traditional clothing, such as the
[Garibaldi shirt](Garibaldi_shirt "wikilink") of the 1860s.

Blouses usually consist of light fabrics such as silk or thin cotton
fabrics, until the early 1990s are often made of softly falling
[synthetic fibers](synthetic_fiber "wikilink") (e.g. polyester).
Sometimes they are decorated with frills, embroidery or loops. The
classic of the ladies' blouses is the white [shirt
blouse](shirt_blouse "wikilink") (following the classic elegant white
men's shirt). Here the combination possibilities are particularly
diverse. The open spade, peter pan, reverse and [revere
collar](revere_collar "wikilink") is another common type of classic
ladies' blouse.

-   **1913 wrote The week about the ladies' blouse in the Reitsport:**


*"Even if more and more justification is given for the hot summer days
of the casual blouse, the classic [riding
dress](riding_dress "wikilink") made of velvet or
[English](England "wikilink") linen still remains unmatched."*

At the end of the 19th century the [sailor
blouses](sailor_blouse "wikilink") derived from [sailor
suits](sailor_suit "wikilink") were popular for girls to the blue
[pleated skirt](pleated_skirt "wikilink"). In the time of [National
Socialism](National_Socialism "wikilink") this piece of clothing was
rejected as a
[bourgeois](bourgeois "wikilink")-[decadent](decadent "wikilink"). In
the 1950s, the sailor's look then entered the leisure mode for adults.

The high collar in blouses was pushed out during this time by the
[halsferne variant](halsferne_variant "wikilink"). Specialist shops also
offered "ladies' cloaks". [KdW](KdW "wikilink") in Berlin applied in his
illustrated main catalog: 1913 among other things a
[backfisch-confection](backfisch-confection "wikilink"), with eight
blouses between 2.75 and 9.50 Marks. The simplest model was a "wash
blouse, navy, white spotted", the most expensive one "blouse, white,
wash, with tip and stick". One of the novelties of the season was the
pointed "[Charmeuse blouse](Charmeuse_blouse "wikilink"), very elegant
form, pure silk, with very fluffy crepe and lace gown"

During the later Victorian period blouses became common for informal,
practical wear. A simple blouse with a plain skirt was the standard
dress for the newly expanded female
(non-[domestic](Domestic_worker "wikilink")) workforce of the 1890s,
especially for those employed in office work. In the
[1900s](1900s_in_fashion "wikilink") and
[1910s](1910s_in_fashion "wikilink"), elaborate blouses, such as the
"lingerie blouse" (so-called because they were heavily decorated with
[lace](lace "wikilink") and [embroidery](embroidery "wikilink") in a
style formerly restricted to underwear) and the "[Gibson
Girl](Gibson_Girl "wikilink") blouse" with
[tucks](tuck_(sewing) "wikilink") and [pleating](pleat "wikilink"),
became immensely popular for daywear and even some informal evening
wear. Since then, blouses have remained a wardrobe staple, so by now
blouses have not ceased to be fixed in the "popular cloakroom" style.

Blouses are often made of cotton or silk cloth and may or may not
include a [collar](collar_(clothing) "wikilink") and
[sleeves](sleeve "wikilink"). They are generally more tailored than
simple knit tops, and may contain [feminine](feminine "wikilink")
details such as [ruffles](ruffle "wikilink"), a
[tie](Necktie "wikilink") or a soft [bow](Bow_(knot) "wikilink") at the
[neck](neck "wikilink"), or [embroidered
decorations](embroidery "wikilink").

Tailoring provides a closer fit to the wearer's shape. This is achieved
with sewing of features such as [princess
seams](princess_seams "wikilink") or [darting](Dart_(sewing) "wikilink")
in the waist and/or bust.

Blouses (and many women's shirts with buttons) usually have
[buttons](button "wikilink") reversed from that of men's shirts (except
in the case of male [military fatigues](battledress "wikilink")). That
is, the buttons are normally on the wearer's left-hand and the
buttonholes are on the right. The reasons for this are unclear, and
several theories exist without have conclusive evidence. Some suggest
this custom was introduced by launderers so they could distinguish
between women's and men's shirts. One theory purports that the tradition
arose in the [Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink") when one manner of
manifesting wealth was by the number of buttons one wore. Another that
the original design was based on armour which was designed so that a
right-handed opponent would not catch their weapon in the seam and tear
through, and that a person could draw a weapon with their right-hand
without catching it in a loose seam of their own clothes.

Female [servants](servant_(domestic) "wikilink") were in charge of
buttoning their mistress's gowns (since the buttons were usually in the
back). They tired of attempting to deal with buttons that were, from
their point of view, backwards and, as such they started reversing the
placement when making or repairing them. Another possible reason is so
that men can easily undo blouses as, from the front, buttons are on the
same side as a man's shirt. One other theory is that women were normally
dressed by their maids, while men dressed themselves. As such, women's
blouses were designed so it could be easily buttoned by the maid but
that of men were designed so it could be easily buttoned by the person
wearing it.

Although in all the cases proposed the reasons for the distinction no
longer exist, it continues out of [custom](convention_(norm) "wikilink")
or tradition.

While most women prefer to have the top button open for better comfort,
some blouses made for women have looser necklines so the top button can
be fastened without compromising comfort, but giving the same stylish
appearance.

Some women attach various pins and ornaments to their blouses over a
fastened top button for style. Some of these attach directly to the
button itself, others to the collars.

Some blouses do not have a top button at all, and collars are
intentionally styled to be open. They also form part of some nations'
traditional folk costume.

### Styles since World War Two

![](Tanaka_Sonoko_and_Sasada_Kazuko.JPG "Tanaka_Sonoko_and_Sasada_Kazuko.JPG")

Various new and different forms of collar emerged in the 1920s. They
diminished in sizes by the 1950s, but were huge in the 1930s. At the
beginning of the 1970s, popular styles included the rounded collar,
[sausage dog collar](sausage_dog_collar "wikilink"), then extra wide
collar and [double cuffs](double_cuffs "wikilink") from shirts, that
fell on them often from fashions relating to synthetic fabrics like
usually [polyester](polyester "wikilink"). At the beginning of the 1960s
bubic bangs came back, then later wide collars. The fashion of [standing
collar](standing_collar "wikilink") and [federal
collar](federal_collar "wikilink"), loops, [rounded
collars](rounded_collar "wikilink"), [revere
collar](revere_collar "wikilink") and the [smallest
collar](smallest_collar "wikilink"), sometimes with concealed [button
fly](button_fly "wikilink") on a "smoking blouse", attached folds and
stressed set-in-followed in the 1980s. Again, thin and often shining
synthetic fibres were very popular. Towards the end of the 20th Century,
they were of an extra-long blouses of pants style and worn over trousers
or skirt worn, optionally combined with a rather wide belt around the
waist in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Poland, the UK,
Ireland, South Africa and the USA.

The sleeves had been shortened during the early 1950s to the and length
in Europe. They were reduced again in the mid-1990s and are now
regularly at the , , and length around the world. As the eye will be
drawn to the naked flesh below the sleeve, designers often use sleeve
length to focus the minds eye on the slimmer parts of the arm,
particularly short sleeve blouses below the elbow to give the illusion
of a slimmer arm. Sleeveless tops were fashionable and a topical item in
Western Europe and North America during the mid-2000s.

Many fashionable styles of both the 1970s and 1980s were on the go again
after the millennium in the blouse fashion: double cuffs, extra wide
pointed collar, belt around the waist, synthetic fibre and the like.
Often the blouses also embroidery or "crystal stocking", have especially
on collar and string. The blouses with the so-called three-quarter arm
were a striking phenomenon of the 1990s. Blouses can be combined well
and easily with a [blazer](blazer "wikilink"), [tank
top](Sleeveless_shirt "wikilink"), [bolero](Bolero_jacket "wikilink") or
[sweater](sweater "wikilink"), with or without some colourful silks or
bead chain necklaces.

### Eco movement

As part of the [Eco movement](Eco_movement "wikilink")'s folk blouses
for women were cut from natural materials such as flax, linen and
cotton. Men also wore these "Frisian blouses" on occasion.

## Use in Aboyne dress

![](Aboyne_05SV_002.jpg "Aboyne_05SV_002.jpg")

In one version, a tartan pattern skirt is worn with an over-the-shoulder
plaid, a white blouse and petticoat, and a velvet bodice. The
alternative is a white dress over a petticoat, together with a tartan
pattern sash. A typical Aboyne dress consists of a dark
[bodice](bodice "wikilink") or elaborate
[waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink"), decorative blouse, full tartan
[skirt](skirt "wikilink") and some times a
[petticoat](petticoat "wikilink") and [apron](apron "wikilink"). Some
have a [tartan](tartan "wikilink") sash (usually draped over the
shoulder and coming down towards the hem of the skirt in the back)
rather than an apron.

## Use with a dirndl

![](Dirndl.jpg "fig:Dirndl.jpg"). The white part on her body and arms is
the blouse.\]\]

A woman wearing a dirndl, with white blouse, is usual in
[Bavaria](Bavaria "wikilink") and rural Austria. They are usually made
of light fabric (textile), such as silk or cotton thin, until the early
1990s still often from soft covered by art faserstoffen (such as
polyester and satin). They often have fanciful decorations (such as
frills, embroidery, or grinding) and are a classic among the women's
blouses—here the fashionable combination possibilities are especially
varied. The open Spaten—or lapel collar—is another common type of a
classic ladies blouse.

## The blouse jacket or blouson

The blouse jacket or [blouson](blouson "wikilink") is garment drawn
tight at the waist with blousing hanging over the waist band. The new
style of man's chetten lose blouse coat is made of stronger material or
with inner lining, which can be worn alone or as a jacket or over a
separate top is related to. It is related to the [Eisenhower
jacket](Eisenhower_jacket "wikilink").
