([French](French_language "wikilink") for "hide the heart") is a
[top](top_(clothing) "wikilink") for women, composed of two finished
triangular parts, each having a strap. It is closed by overlapping the
two segments and tying the straps behind the back or along the side,
depending on the length. The triangular shape of the sides makes the
garment a type of V-neck.
