![](Whitecamisole.jpg "fig:Whitecamisole.jpg") A **camisole** is a
sleeveless [undergarment](undergarment "wikilink") for women, normally
extending to the waist. The camisole is usually made of
[satin](satin "wikilink"), [nylon](nylon "wikilink"), or
[cotton](cotton "wikilink").

## Historical definition

Historically, **camisole** referred to jackets of various kinds,[1]
including overshirts (worn under a
[doublet](Doublet_(clothing) "wikilink") or
[bodice](bodice "wikilink")),[2] women's
[négligées](Negligee "wikilink"), and sleeved jackets worn by men.[3]

## Modern usage

![](Woman_in_white_top_looking_down_22March2009.jpg "fig:Woman_in_white_top_looking_down_22March2009.jpg")
led to closer fitting camisoles in the late 2000s and the 2010s.\]\]

In modern usage a camisole or **cami** is a loose-fitting[4][5]
sleeveless woman's undergarment which covers the top part of the body
but is shorter than a
[chemise](Chemise#Modern_usage_of_the_term "wikilink"). A camisole
normally extends to the waist but is sometimes cropped to expose the
[midriff](midriff "wikilink"), or extended to cover the entire pelvic
region. Camisoles are manufactured from light materials,[6] commonly
[cotton](cotton "wikilink")-based, occasionally satin or silk, or
stretch fabrics such as [lycra](lycra "wikilink"),
[nylon](nylon "wikilink"), or [spandex](spandex "wikilink").

A camisole typically has thin "[spaghetti
straps](spaghetti_strap "wikilink")" and can be worn over a
[brassiere](brassiere "wikilink") or without one. Since 1989, some
camisoles[7] have come with a built-in [underwire
bra](underwire_bra "wikilink") or other support which eliminates the
need for a bra among those who prefer one. Starting around the 2000s,
camisoles have been known to be [used as
outerwear](Underwear_as_outerwear "wikilink").[8]

A variety of sleeveless body shaping undergarments have been derived
from the camisole shape,[9] offering medium control of the bust, waist
and/or [abdomen](Human_abdomen "wikilink"). Such **control camisoles**
are the most casual of shaping garments, covering the torso from above
the chest to at or below the waist. They look similar to tight-fitting
[cotton](cotton "wikilink") or [silk](silk "wikilink") camisoles, but
the straps are usually wider, the [hems](hem "wikilink") longer, and the
stretchy, shiny fabric provides a smoothing touch.
