A **camp shirt**, variously known as a **cabin shirt**, **cabana
shirt**[1], and **lounge shirt**, is a loose, straight-cut, woven,
short-sleeved button-front [shirt](shirt "wikilink") or
[blouse](blouse "wikilink") with a simple [placket](placket "wikilink")
front opening and a "camp collar" - a one-piece
[collar](Collar_(clothing) "wikilink") (no [band
collar](band_collar "wikilink")) that can be worn open and spread or
closed at the neck with a button and loop. It usually has a straight
hemmed bottom falling at hip level, not intended to be tucked into
trousers.[2] While generally made from plain, single color fabrics,
variants include duo tone [bowling shirts](bowling_shirt "wikilink") and
print patterned [aloha shirts](aloha_shirt "wikilink").
