A **chemisette** is an article of women's clothing worn to fill in the
front and neckline of any garment, which gives the appearance of a
blouse or shirt worn under the outer garment without adding bulk at the
waist or upper arm.

Chemisettes of linen or cotton were often worn with day dresses in the
mid-19th century, and could be decorated with tucks, embroidery
(especially whitework), or lace.

When wide pagoda sleeves were fashionable (1850s), chemisettes might
have matching false undersleeves known as engageantes
