[right\|thumb\|Man in kilt and Ghillie
shirt.](/File:Kilt_Murray.jpg "wikilink") A **Ghillie shirt**, also
known as **Jacobean** or **Jacobite**, is an informal traditional shirt
usually worn with a [kilt](/kilt "wikilink"). The term Ghillie refers to
the criss-crossed lacing style made of leather as also seen on the
Ghillie Brogue. Ghillie shirts are considered to be more casual than
their shirt and waist-coat counterpart that is normally seen with the
kilt. The Ghillie shirt existed before the kilt, with there being no
documentation for kilts until 1575,

Ghillie shirts are traditionally used for dances or
[ceilidhs](/ceilidh "wikilink") as they are light and spacious to allow
for air to pass through. They do not need to be worn with any sort of
tie. The Irish version of the Ghillie shirt is the [Grandfather
shirt](/Grandfather_shirt "wikilink").[1][2][3]
