**Ghost shirts** are shirts or other clothing items created by [Ghost
dancers](Ghost_dance "wikilink") and thought to be imbued with spiritual
powers.

Ghost shirts, sacred to certain factions of [Lakota
people](Lakota_people "wikilink"), were thought to guard against bullets
through spiritual power. Jack Wilson (known in Lakota circles as
[Wovoka](Wovoka "wikilink")) opposed rebellion against the white
settlers. Wovoka believed that through
[pacificism](pacificism "wikilink"), the Lakota and the rest of the
Native Americans would be delivered from white oppression in the form of
[earthquakes](earthquakes "wikilink"). However, two Lakota warriors and
followers of Wovoka, [Kicking Bear](Kicking_Bear "wikilink") and [Short
Bull](Arnold_Short_Bull "wikilink"), thought otherwise, and believed
that Ghost shirts would protect the wearer enough to actively resist
white oppression.[1] The shirts did not work as promised, and when the
U.S. Army attacked, 153 Lakota died, with 50 wounded and 150 missing at
the [Wounded Knee Massacre](Wounded_Knee_Massacre "wikilink").

Anthropologist [James Mooney](James_Mooney "wikilink") argued that the
most likely source of the belief that ghost shirts could repel bullets
is the [Mormon](Mormon "wikilink") [temple
garment](temple_garment "wikilink") (which Mormons believe protect the
[pious](pious "wikilink") wearer from evil, though not bullets).
Scholars believe that in 1890 chief [Kicking
Bear](Kicking_Bear "wikilink") introduced the concept to his people, the
Lakota.[2]

In [Kurt Vonnegut](Kurt_Vonnegut "wikilink")'s novel [*Player
Piano*](Player_Piano_(novel) "wikilink"), a faction revolting against
the rigidly hierarchical, mechanized United States of the future calls
itself the Ghost Shirt Society. The founders claim that, like the
militant Native Americans of the late 19th century, they are "mak\[ing\]
one last fight for the old values".[3]
