**Granddad shirt** or "50s T-Shirt" is a long-sleeved or short-sleeved
[flannel](/flannel "wikilink") or brushed [cotton](/cotton "wikilink")
[band collared](/band_collar "wikilink") shirt worn throughout
[Ireland](/Ireland "wikilink"). Traditional shirts are white with
coloured vertical stripes. Longer shirts are used as
[nightshirts](/nightshirt "wikilink") or [pajamas](/pajamas "wikilink").
The nightshirt version can include a matching
[nightcap](/Nightcap_(garment) "wikilink").

The style of shirt was also worn by working-class men in the [United
Kingdom](/United_Kingdom "wikilink") during the industrial era. At this
period, the lack of a turndown or collar "cape" was filled by the use of
a [detachable collar](/detachable_collar "wikilink"). The 2010s decade
has also seen the garment feature as a [mainstream
fashion](/2010s_in_fashion#Men "wikilink") item for men.[1][2]

The grandfather shirt is also made of [Irish
linen](/Irish_linen "wikilink"). The linen version is colloquially known
as a 'Sunday shirt'. Sunday shirts are often paired with black trousers
or Irish tweed pants and worn to [mass](/Mass_(liturgy) "wikilink"),
[christenings](/Infant_baptism "wikilink"),
[funerals](/funerals "wikilink"), and [weddings](/weddings "wikilink").

In popular culture, a variety of traditional Irish clothing was featured
on the BBC series, [Ballykissangel](/Ballykissangel "wikilink") and the
Irish folk band, [The Clancy
Brothers](/The_Clancy_Brothers'_Greatest_Hits "wikilink") were often
photographed wearing traditional Irish clothes.

An identical collarless shirt or tunic, known as a
[kurta](/kurta "wikilink"), is traditionally worn in the
[Islamic](/Islam "wikilink") world and [South
Asia](/South_Asia "wikilink"). This usually has three or four buttons,
and is often decorated with intricate
[embroidery](/embroidery "wikilink").
