The **guayabera** (/ɡwaɪ.əˈbɛrə/) also known in Mexico as *Camisa de
Yucatán* (Yucatán Shirt) is a Cuban men's summer shirt, worn outside the
trousers, distinguished by two vertical rows of closely sewn pleats
running the length of the front and back of the shirt. Typically made of
linen, silk, or cotton, and appropriate for hot or humid weather,
guayaberas are popular in Cuba, the Caribbean (especially the Dominican
Republic, and Puerto Rico), Mexico, Central America, South America,
Southeast Asia, the south of Spain and Portugal, in general, the
Hispanic world.

## Details

The design of a typical guayabera is distinguished by several details:

-   Long or short sleeves, the more common being the short-sleeved
    version, having a cuffed sleeve with a single decorative button.
-   Either two or four patch pockets and two vertical rows of *alforzas*
    (fine, tiny pleats, usually ten, sewn closely together) run along
    the front and three along the back of the shirt. The pockets are
    detailed with *alforzas* that are identical to, and aligned with,
    the *alforzas* on the body of the shirt.
-   The top of each pocket is usually adorned with a matching shirt
    button, as are the bottoms of the *alforza* pleats. Vertical rows of
    adjusting buttons are often used at the bottom hem. While most
    versions of the design have no placket covering the buttons, a few
    newer designs do.
-   Some shirt designs include slits on either side, and these include
    two or three buttons. The bottom has a straight hem, and is never
    tucked into the trousers.

Though traditionally worn in white and pastels, guayaberas are now
available in many solid colors. Black guayaberas, embroidered with
colorful flowers and festooned with French cuffs, have for many decades
been extremely popular in Mexico and are considered formalwear in some
situations.

Mexican guayaberas often use complicated embroidery as a supplement to
the traditional *alforzas*. This style originated in Mérida, Mexico.

## Usage

Former United States Secretary of State John Kerry and Colombian
President Juan Manuel Santos wear guayaberas while discussing an
upcoming peace treaty. The guayabera is often worn in formal contexts,
such as offices and weddings. In Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico,
and Puerto Rico, guayaberas are part of the traditional wear for men and
may be considered formalwear. In 2010, Cuba reinstated the guayabera as
the "official formal dress garment".

Guayaberas have been worn extensively by a number of Latin American
political leaders, including Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Cesar Chavez,
Carlos Prío Socarrás, and Fidel Castro. This is often interpreted as a
sign of the wearer's affiliation with populist political positions.
Michael Manley, populist Jamaican prime minister, specifically advocated
for the guayabera as an anti-colonialist mode of dress, and conversely
the shirt was later banned in Parliament by the conservative Jamaica
Labour Party. Similarly, Mexican populist Luis Echeverría advocated for
its use in Mexico in part to symbolize rejection of European and
American-style business suits.

U.S. presidents, including Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Barack
Obama, have worn the shirts as a sign of solidarity when visiting the
Cuban community in Miami and when attending Latin American summits.
Visiting politicians are sometimes given the shirts by Cuban American or
Latin American political leaders. [Category:Latin American
