A **jersey** is an item of [knitted](/knit "wikilink")
[clothing](/clothing "wikilink"), traditionally in
[wool](/wool "wikilink") or [cotton](/cotton "wikilink"), with
[sleeves](/sleeve "wikilink"), worn as a
[pullover](/Sweater "wikilink"), as it does not open at the front,
unlike a [cardigan](/Cardigan_(sweater) "wikilink"). It is usually
close-fitting and machine knitted in contrast to a
[guernsey](/guernsey_(clothing) "wikilink") that is more often hand knit
with a thicker [yarn](/yarn "wikilink"). The word is usually used
interchangeably with [sweater](/sweater "wikilink").[1]

The shirts now commonly worn by sports teams as part of the team uniform
are also referred to as jerseys, although they bear little resemblance
to the original hand-kitted woolen garments.

## In sports

A jersey as used in [sports](/sport "wikilink") is a
[shirt](/shirt "wikilink") worn by a member of a team, typically
depicting the [athlete](/sportsperson "wikilink")'s name and team number
as well as the [logotype](/logotype "wikilink") of the team or corporate
sponsor. [Cycling jerseys](/Cycling_jersey "wikilink") of specific color
or pattern represent certain statuses in [cycling](/cycling "wikilink"),
such as the yellow jersey of the leader of the [general classification
in the Tour de
France](/general_classification_in_the_Tour_de_France "wikilink"), or
the [rainbow jersey](/rainbow_jersey "wikilink") for the world champion.
Cycling jerseys are usually made of synthetic
[microfiber](/microfiber "wikilink") material to aid in wicking sweat
away from the skin to allow it to [evaporate](/evaporate "wikilink").
The main garment of an [ice hockey](/ice_hockey "wikilink") uniform,
which was traditionally called a sweater, is increasingly known as a
[hockey jersey](/hockey_jersey "wikilink"). This garment, along with
[basketball](/basketball "wikilink") jerseys which are usually
[sleeveless](/sleeveless "wikilink") and
[baseball](/baseball "wikilink") jerseys which are usually button up,
have become fashion accessories. A related term is
"[bib](/Bib_(garment) "wikilink")", which may refer to a shirt (jersey,
esp. in Britain). In [Australian rules
football](/Australian_rules_football "wikilink"), the player's shirt is
known as a
"[guernsey](/guernsey_(Australian_rules_football) "wikilink")".[2]

In some sports, such as [ice hockey](/ice_hockey "wikilink"),
[baseball](/baseball "wikilink"), [basketball](/basketball "wikilink"),
and various [football](/football "wikilink") codes, a player's jersey
may be "[retired](/retired_number#See_also "wikilink")". When a jersey
is retired, that player's jersey is placed usually where the team plays
in honor of that player's accomplishment. Generally, when a jersey is
retired, the [number](/Number_(sports) "wikilink") on the player's
jersey is made unavailable for future players.[3]
