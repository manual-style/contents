The **jester blouse** was a popular item in 1950s and early 1960s
women's fashion. [Fashion designer](Fashion_designer "wikilink")
[Louella Ballerino](Louella_Ballerino "wikilink") found an illustration
of a [court jester](court_jester "wikilink") which inspired her to
design her "sun and fun" fashions. The jester theme appeared in long
pointed collars tipped with bell-like buttons, harlequin prints, and in
the jagged points which occasionally outlined an apron
[overskirt](overskirt "wikilink"). Ballerino created
plunged-to-the-waist jester blouses in cotton or wool jersey topped sun
backed dresses.[1]

## Popularity

In March 1961 Scotties sold a jester shirt made by Cromwell Mills at
[Bloomingdales](Bloomingdales "wikilink") and
[Filene's](Filene's "wikilink"), It was red, white, and blue in
color.[2] The jester blouse often featured a nautical theme as with some
patterns illustrated in the July 27, 1950 *[Washington
Post](Washington_Post "wikilink")*. In these fashions young girls frolic
attired in change-about four way dresses, nautically styled.[3] At
[Bullock's](Bullock's "wikilink") in downtown [Los
Angeles](Los_Angeles "wikilink"), mother-daughter jester collar blouses
were advertised as "the new big collar look", in December 1962.[4]

## Style revival

The "Pierrot" look for women became popular in [Paris,
France](Paris,_France "wikilink") in 1979. The look featured "court
jester" blouses as part of the trend. The blouses were worn together
with tasseled shoes in bold checkerboard squares.[5]
