Murkowski](Lisa_Murkowski "wikilink") wearing a
kuspuk](/File:Lisa_Murkowski_in_kuspuk.jpg "wikilink") A **kuspuk** ()
(from [Yup'ik](/Yup'ik_language "wikilink") *qaspeq*;[1][2]
[Iñupiaq](/Iñupiaq_language "wikilink"): *atikłuk*[3][4]) is a hooded
overshirt with a large front pocket commonly worn among [Alaska
Natives](/Alaska_Natives "wikilink").[5] Kuspuks are
[tunic](/tunic "wikilink")-length, falling anywhere from below the hips
to below the knees.[6] The bottom portion of kuspuks worn by women may
be gathered and akin to a skirt. Kuspuks tend to be pullover garments,
though some have zippers.[7]

Though kuspuks are traditionally a [Yupik](/Yup'ik_people "wikilink")
garment,[8] they are now worn by both men and women of many Native
groups, as well as by non-Natives.[9][10][11] The garment was originally
made of animal skin or gut and was worn over a fur
[parka](/parka "wikilink") to keep the parka clean.[12][13][14] As
stores became more common in [Bush](/the_Bush_(Alaska) "wikilink")
villages, kuspuks began to be made of calico grain sacks.[15] Kuspuks
are now generally made from brightly printed cotton
[calico](/calico "wikilink"), [velvet](/velvet "wikilink"), or
[corduroy](/corduroy "wikilink") trimmed with
[rickrack](/rickrack "wikilink").[16][17][18] Today, kuspuks are often
worn as a blouse with pants.[19][20]

Many Alaska legislators and their staff members wear kuspuks on
Fridays.[21][22][23] The tradition was started by Representative Mary
Kapsner (now [Mary Sattler](/Mary_Sattler "wikilink")) of Bethel around
2000.[24][25] The legislative dress code, however, requires that kuspuks
be worn with dark pants.[26] Legislators' enthusiasm for kuspuks has
contributed to their rising popularity in the state.[27]

Travelers wearing kuspuks have faced scrutiny from the federal
[Transportation Security
Administration](/Transportation_Security_Administration "wikilink")
because of the garment's looseness.[28][29] Senators [Lisa
Murkowski](/Lisa_Murkowski "wikilink") and [Mark
Begich](/Mark_Begich "wikilink") have criticized this practice as
culturally insensitive.[30][31]

[Pope John Paul II](/Pope_John_Paul_II "wikilink") was presented a
kuspuk as a gift when he visited Alaska in 1981.[32]
