A **nightshirt** is a [garment](/garment "wikilink") intended for wear
while [sleeping](/sleeping "wikilink"). It is longer than most regular
[shirts](/shirt "wikilink"), reaching down to the thighs or below the
knees,[1] leaving some of the legs uncovered. It is generally
loose-fitting to avoid restricting the wearer's movement while sleeping.

Until the 16th century men slept naked or in a day-shirt; subsequently a
night-shirt, varying in quality, was worn in bed. Nobles in the 16th
century wore embroidered shirts or "wrought night-shirts". By the 19th
century the night-shirt resembled a day-shirt with a loose, turned-down
collar, or a loose, ankle-length nightgown was worn.[2]

Occasionally worn in the 20th and 21st centuries by women as well.
