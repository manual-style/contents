shirt"](The_Puffy_Shirt "wikilink"), an example of a poet shirt
blouse.\]\] A **poet shirt** (also known as a **poet blouse** or
**pirate shirt**) is a type of [shirt](shirt "wikilink") made as a
loose-fitting [blouse](blouse "wikilink") with [full bishop
sleeves](Sleeve#Types_of_sleeves "wikilink"), usually decorated with
large [frills](Ruffle "wikilink") on the front and on the cuffs.[1]
Typically, it has a laced-up V-neck opening, designed to pull over the
head, but can have a full-length opening fastened by buttons. The
[collar](Collar_(clothing) "wikilink") may be standing or folded over
with points. Fabrics commonly used in its manufacture include
[linen](linen "wikilink"), [cotton](cotton "wikilink"),
[satin](satin "wikilink") and [velvet](velvet "wikilink"), while frills
may be of the same fabric or of [lace](lace "wikilink"). Originally
intended as a male garment, it is also worn by women today (though still
interchangeably referred to as both a "shirt" and a "blouse" regardless
of which gender is wearing it).[2]

## History

Although descended from the shirts worn by men in the 17th and 18th
centuries, the modern poet blouse combines two aspects: the fineness of
ruffled shirts worn as an undergarment by aristocrats and the
informality of plain shirts worn (normally open-necked) as a standalone
garment by workmen. Inspired by
[Romanticism](Romanticism "wikilink"),[3][4] it was a popular style for
boys during the 19th century[5] and for the pseudo-historical costumes
worn by Hollywood actors portraying characters such as swordsmen or
pirates during the 20th century.

One example of this is professional musician/actor [Meat
Loaf](Meat_Loaf "wikilink"), who has been known for his eccentric
on-stage attire since the late 1970s, which typically consists of either
sequined black vests, or a tuxedo consisting of a black blazer, matching
pants & shoes, and a white poet blouse with a red handkerchief, which he
holds in his hand or ties to the microphone stand. Many fans & music
reviewers such as inthestudio.net would come to refer to this look as
his "prom tux" in popular culture, as this type of suit is most commonly
associated with high school proms.

A tailored version of the poet shirt became highly fashionable for young
men during the 1960s, particularly in London. Jane Ormsby Gore described
her discussions at that time with her then husband, [Michael
Rainey](Michael_Rainey "wikilink"), who owned a men's clothing shop in
[Chelsea](Chelsea,_London "wikilink"): "We were very influenced by
[Byron](Byron "wikilink") â€¦ those Byron shirts with frilly fronts and
big sleeves".[6] Epitomised by bands such as [Duran
Duran](Duran_Duran "wikilink") and [Spandau
Ballet](Spandau_Ballet "wikilink"), the vogue for
[androgynous](Androgyny "wikilink") frilly blouses played a significant
part in the [New Romantic](New_Romanticism "wikilink") male fashion of
the 1980s.[7] Today, the style remains popular in some modern movements
such as the [Goth subculture](Gothic_fashion "wikilink"), where it may
be valued simply for its romantic or swashbuckling image, intended as
part of a themed costume (e.g. [vampire](vampire "wikilink")) or worn in
defiance of mainstream conventions as a deliberate expression of gender
ambiguity (in the same tradition as [glam
rock](glam_rock "wikilink")[8]).

A ruffled poet shirt, often worn with a wide belt or other item of
clothing traditionally associated with
[pirates](Pirates_in_popular_culture "wikilink"), has been the central
theme of a spate of fashion trends stimulated by the *[Pirates of the
Caribbean](Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_(film_series) "wikilink")* series of
adventure films, the first of which was released in 2003.[9]
