![](rashguard.jpg "fig:rashguard.jpg") A **rash guard**, also known as
**rash vest** or **rashie**, is an athletic [shirt](shirt "wikilink")
made of [spandex](spandex "wikilink") and [nylon](nylon "wikilink") or
[polyester](polyester "wikilink"). The name rash guard reflects the fact
that the shirt protects the wearer against [rashes](rash "wikilink")
caused by [abrasion](Abrasion_(mechanical) "wikilink"), or by
[sunburn](sunburn "wikilink") from extended exposure to the sun. These
shirts can be worn by themselves, or under a
[wetsuit](wetsuit "wikilink"). A rash guard by itself is used for light
coverage in warm to extreme summer temperatures for several
[watersports](watersports "wikilink") including
[surfing](surfing "wikilink"), [canoe polo](canoe_polo "wikilink"),
water survival training, [scuba diving](scuba_diving "wikilink"),
[snorkeling](snorkeling "wikilink"),
[freediving](freediving "wikilink"),
[wakeboarding](wakeboarding "wikilink"),
[bodysurfing](bodysurfing "wikilink"),
[bodyboarding](bodyboarding "wikilink"),
[windsurfing](windsurfing "wikilink"),
[kitesurfing](kitesurfing "wikilink"), [kayaking](kayaking "wikilink"),
[stand up paddle surfing](stand_up_paddle_surfing "wikilink"), or
[swimming](Human_swimming "wikilink"). There are also lower body rash
guards, which are similar to [compression
shorts](compression_shorts "wikilink") to be worn under the surfers'
boardshorts, but more specialized for surfers.

Rash guards are most often worn in surfing when the weather is too warm
for a [wetsuit](wetsuit "wikilink"), and to prevent wax-based chafing
from sliding on and off of the surf board, on either the torso, or the
legs. A surfboard's wax holds sand from the beach that could rub against
a surfer's torso while paddling out to the break, or legs while sitting
atop one's board. Rash guards also offer some protection from the sun
(measured by its [Ultraviolet Protection
Factor](Sun_protective_clothing#UPF_rating "wikilink")) and slight
protection against jelly fish stings and are sometimes worn under
wetsuits to prevent [chafing](Chafing_(skin) "wikilink"). A rash guard
helps to prevent irritation caused by rapid impact with surface water
and waves as well.

Rash guards are thought to have originated in
[Australia](Australia "wikilink"),[1] where they are commonly referred
to as "rashies" or "rashys." Variations of the rash guard have made
their way into other sports including [baseball](baseball "wikilink"),
[American football](American_football "wikilink"), [water
polo](water_polo "wikilink"), [Grappling](Grappling "wikilink"),
[Brazilian jiu-jitsu](Brazilian_jiu-jitsu "wikilink"), and [mixed
martial arts](mixed_martial_arts "wikilink"). Athletes who wear rash
guards in MMA/Grappling/BJJ seek protection against cuts, mat burns, and
the spread of diseases.

Other important components of a rash guard include
[flatlock](Overlock#Types_of_overlock_stitches "wikilink") stitching,
and six panel construction. Flatlock stitching creates a seam where the
seam allowances lies flat to the garment instead of hanging loose from
it. It is made by adjusting the overlock or the thread overedge stitch.
Flatlock stitching increases the strength of the garment for intense
exercise or recreational activities. Six panel construction and
different material for separate body parts sewn together in panels allow
the user increased mobility wet or dry versus the conventional
four-panel tee shirt construction.

The combination of products used to construct a rash guard differ
slightly depending on the designer. The use of nylon and spandex create
a garment that is lightweight, quick drying, flexible, durable,
naturally antibacterial and water wicking.

## Variations

Some variations include the following:

-   Cropped rash guard: A rash guard that is similar to a [crop
    top](Crop_top "wikilink") and is made specifically for females. It
    can be paired with swimwear bottoms.
-   Rash guard overall/bodysuit: A hybrid one-piece swimsuit (with
    boyleg/short or classic bottoms) with rash guard material and
    design. There are designs for males and females and this variation
    is much catered to children.

## Swim shirts

Swim shirts are relatively new to the consumer market, but are growing
in popularity. They are generally more loose fitting[2] and casually
worn. Their primary purpose is to offer an alternative to sunscreen to
protect the wearer's skin from the sun's UV radiation and possible [skin
cancer](skin_cancer "wikilink"). Many swim shirts carry a
[UPF](sun_protective_clothing "wikilink") rating of 50+, which blocks
out over 98% of the sun’s harmful rays. Many people find that sunscreen
isn’t always enough because it is often not used properly and some have
skin allergies or sensitivities to chemicals in sunscreens. Children's
skin can be especially sensitive to the sun and sunscreens. Many
children, and parents, find it is much easier to put on a swim shirt as
it is loose and easily slipped on. There are also zip front rash guards
available which makes slipping in and out of them even easier,
especially when wet.[3] Furthermore, it is comfortable and yet gives sun
protection.[4] Even though the name generally applies to water sports,
people use swim shirts for an array of activities: swimming,
[boating](boating "wikilink"), [golfing](golfing "wikilink"),
[tennis](tennis "wikilink"), [gardening](gardening "wikilink"), playing
in the sprinklers, [water parks](water_parks "wikilink"), beach trips,
pool play, rivers and lakes, [water skiing](water_skiing "wikilink"),
surfing, [snow skiing](snow_skiing "wikilink"),
[sledding](sledding "wikilink"),
[skimboarding](skimboarding "wikilink"), in mixed martial arts and
Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and even as normal everyday clothing.
