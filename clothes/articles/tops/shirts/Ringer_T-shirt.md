A **ringer T-shirt** is a [T-shirt](T-shirt "wikilink") in which the
jersey shirt fabric is one color, but the ribbing used for the collar
and the sleeve bands are of a contrasting color.

Traditionally, the most common ringer colors were white with black
ribbing. Ringers were introduced in the United States in the early 1950s
and gained popularity, especially among youth and the rock-and-roll
subculture.

Ringers grew in popularity even more as the 1970s began and remained
popular throughout that decade. But in the 1980s, other fashions
eclipsed the ringer T-shirt.

In the early 2000s, ringer T-shirts experienced a resurgence, mostly
among teens, and gained popularity in the first decade, albeit at a
reduced level from their 1970s heyday.
