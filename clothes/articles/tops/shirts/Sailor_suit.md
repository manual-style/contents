[thumb\|A Royal Naval rating in 1A uniform (a modern sailor

suit** is a [uniform](/Military_uniform "wikilink") traditionally worn
by [enlisted](/enlisted "wikilink") [seamen](/Seaman_(rank) "wikilink")
in a [navy](/navy "wikilink") or other governmental sea services. It
later developed into a popular clothing style for children, especially
as [dress clothes](/dress_clothes "wikilink").

## Origins and history

In the [Royal Navy](/Royal_Navy "wikilink"), the sailor suit, also
called naval rig,[1] is known as Number One dress and is worn by able
rates and leading hands. It is primarily ceremonial, although it dates
from the old working rig of Royal Navy sailors which has continuously
evolved since its first introduction in 1857.[2] Versions have been
adopted by many navies from around the world.

The flap collar is perhaps the most recognizable item of the sailor
suit. It is often considered lucky to touch a sailor's collar.[3] The
bell-bottomed trousers were designed so that they could be rolled up
easily when scrubbing the decks.

## As children's clothing

In 1846, the four-year-old [Albert Edward, Prince of
Wales](/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") was given a
scaled-down version of the uniform worn by ratings on the [Royal
Yacht](/Royal_Yacht "wikilink"). He wore his miniature sailor suit
during a cruise off the [Channel Islands](/Channel_Islands "wikilink")
that September, delighting [his mother](/Queen_Victoria "wikilink") and
the public. Popular engravings, including the famous portrait done by
[Winterhalter](/Franz_Winterhalter "wikilink"), spread the idea, and by
the 1870s, the sailor suit had become normal dress for both
[boys](/boy "wikilink") and [girls](/girl "wikilink") all over the
world. Some Western cartoon and comic characters use a sailor suit as
their trademarks; examples include [Popeye](/Popeye "wikilink"), [Donald
Duck](/Donald_Duck "wikilink"), and [Fiddler
Pig](/Three_Little_Pigs_(film) "wikilink"). Sailor suits have been worn
by the members of the [Vienna Boys'
Choir](/Vienna_Boys'_Choir "wikilink") on their international tours.

A female version of the sailor suit, the [sailor
dress](/sailor_dress "wikilink"), was popularly known in early 20th
century America as a *Peter Thomson dress* after a naval tailor with
outlets in New York and Philadelphia.[4]

## Asian school uniforms

Many schools in some Asian countries, including Japan, the
Philippines,[5] Taiwan, North Korea, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore
and Thailand, have adopted sailor outfits as a school uniform.[6]

### Japan

Sailor suits are especially common in Japanese girls' schools, known as
[sailor fuku](/sailor_fuku "wikilink") by the Japanese. They are so
common that the image of the outfit has evolved to be strongly
associated with youth and female adolescence in popular culture. As a
result, sailor uniforms are seen very frequently in Japanese dramas,
movies, anime, manga, music videos and concert performances of pop teen
idol groups.
