**Sanbenito** ([Spanish](Spanish_language "wikilink"):
*sambenito*;[1][2] [Catalan](Catalan_language "wikilink"): *gramalleta*,
*sambenet*) was a penitential garment that was used especially during
the [Spanish Inquisition](Spanish_Inquisition "wikilink"). It was
similar to a [scapular](scapular "wikilink"), either yellow with red
[saltires](saltire "wikilink") for penitent
[heretics](Heresy "wikilink") or black and decorated with
[devils](devil "wikilink") and [flames](flame "wikilink") for impenitent
heretics to wear at an [auto da fé](auto_da_fé "wikilink") (meaning "act
of faith").[3]

## Etymology

"San Benito" is the Spanish name of either [Benedict the
Moor](Benedict_the_Moor "wikilink") or [Benedict of
Nursia](Saint_Benedict "wikilink"). An alternative etymology by
[Covarrubias](Miguel_Covarrubias "wikilink") and former editions of the
[Diccionario de la Real Academia
Española](Diccionario_de_la_Real_Academia_Española "wikilink") has it
from *saco bendito* ("blessed sack"). [Américo
Castro](Américo_Castro "wikilink") "proved that it does not come from
*saco bendito*".[4]

## Description and use

González Obregon describes the three basic types of tunics used to
distinguish those being punished by the Inquisition. These were the
*Samarra*, *Fuego revolto*, and the *Sambenito*. The *Samarra* was
painted with dragons, devils, and flames amongst which the image of the
prisoner could be distinguished, signifying that the impenitent heretic
was condemned to be burnt alive at the stake. The *Fuego revolto* was
painted simply with flames pointing downwards, signifying that the
heretic who became penitent after being condemned was not to be burnt
alive at the stake, but was to have the mercy of being strangled before
the fire was lit. Finally the *Sambenito* featured red saltires, whose
wearer was only to do [penance](penance "wikilink"). Eventually all
three types of tunics became known as *sambenito*; a conical cap,
denominated *[coroza](capirote "wikilink")* (and
*[capirote](capirote "wikilink")*), of the same material and motifs as
the corresponding *sambenito*, would also be worn.

The heretics, found guilty by the
[inquisitors](Grand_Inquisitor "wikilink"), had to walk in the
[procession](procession "wikilink") wearing the *sambenito* as a [Shirt
of Flame](Shirt_of_Flame "wikilink"), the *coroza*, the rope around the
neck, the [rosary](rosary "wikilink"), and in their hands a yellow or
green wax candle.

Originally the penitential garments were hung up in the churches as
mementos of disgrace to their wearers, and as the trophies of the [Holy
Inquisition](Inquisition "wikilink"). The lists of the punished were
also called sambenitos. The bearers of the surnames of those listed in
the [church of Santo
Domingo](Church_of_Santo_Domingo_(Palma_de_Mallorca) "wikilink") in
[Palma de Mallorca](Palma_de_Mallorca "wikilink") were discriminated
against as *[xuetas](xueta "wikilink")* (the local name for Converso
Jews), even when those surnames were also born by [Old
Christians](Old_Christian "wikilink") and the surnames of other Majorcan
Judaizers were not preserved at the cathedral.

The sanbenito should not be confused with the yellow robes worn by some
[monks](monk "wikilink"); which are also garments related to
[penitence](penitence "wikilink") and which is one reason that caused
the Inquisition to prefer common woollen dyed yellow with red crosses
for the sambenito. Such were the penitential robes in 1514, when
[Cardinal Francisco Ximénez de
Cisneros](Francisco_Jiménez_de_Cisneros "wikilink") replaced the common
crosses with those of [Saint Andrew](Saint_Andrew "wikilink"). The
inquisitors afterwards designated a different tunic for each class of
penitents.

In the 1945 edition of *México Viejo*, [Luis González
Obregón](Luis_González_Obregón "wikilink") shows images from [Felipe A.
Limborch](Felipe_A._Limborch "wikilink")'s *Historia Inquisitionis*,
dated 1692, which were images of Sanbenitos used in the Inquisition.
