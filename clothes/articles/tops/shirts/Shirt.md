A **shirt** is a cloth garment for the upper body (from the neck to the
waist).

Originally an [undergarment](undergarment "wikilink") worn exclusively
by men, it has become, in [American
English](American_English "wikilink"), a catch-all term for a broad
variety of upper-body garments and undergarments. In [British
English](British_English "wikilink"), a shirt is more specifically a
garment with a [collar](collar_(clothing) "wikilink"), sleeves with
[cuffs](cuff "wikilink"), and a full vertical opening with buttons or
snaps (North Americans would call that a "[dress
shirt](dress_shirt "wikilink")", a specific type of collared shirt). A
shirt can also be worn with a [necktie](necktie "wikilink") under the
shirt collar.

## History

The world's oldest preserved garment, discovered by [Flinders
Petrie](Flinders_Petrie "wikilink"), is a "highly sophisticated" linen
shirt from a First Dynasty Egyptian tomb at
[Tarkan](Tarkhan_(Egypt) "wikilink"), dated to c. 3000 BC: "the
shoulders and sleeves have been finely pleated to give form-fitting
trimness while allowing the wearer room to move. The small fringe formed
during weaving along one edge of the cloth has been placed by the
designer to decorate the neck opening and side seam."[1]

The shirt was an item of clothing that only men could wear as underwear,
until the twentieth century.[2] Although the women's
[chemise](chemise "wikilink") was a closely related garment to the
men's, it is the men's garment that became the modern shirt.[3] In the
[Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink"), it was a plain, undyed garment
worn next to the skin and under regular garments. In medieval artworks,
the shirt is only visible (uncovered) on humble characters, such as
[shepherds](shepherd "wikilink"), prisoners, and
[penitents](Penance "wikilink").[4] In the seventeenth century, men's
shirts were allowed to show, with much the same
[erotic](Eroticism "wikilink") import as visible underwear today.[5] In
the eighteenth century, instead of underpants, men "relied on the long
tails of shirts ... to serve the function of drawers.[6]
Eighteenth-century costume historian [Joseph
Strutt](Joseph_Strutt_(engraver_and_antiquary) "wikilink") believed that
men who did not wear shirts to bed were indecent.[7] Even as late as
1879, a visible shirt with nothing over it was considered improper.[8]

The shirt sometimes had frills at the neck or cuffs. In the sixteenth
century, men's shirts often had [embroidery](embroidery "wikilink"), and
sometimes frills or [lace](lace "wikilink") at the neck and cuffs and
through the eighteenth-century long neck frills, or
[jabots](Jabot_(neckwear) "wikilink"), were fashionable.[9][10] Coloured
shirts began to appear in the early nineteenth century, as can be seen
in the paintings of [George Caleb
Bingham](George_Caleb_Bingham "wikilink"). They were considered casual
wear, for lower-class workers only, until the twentieth century. For a
gentleman, "to wear a sky-blue shirt was unthinkable in 1860 but had
become standard by 1920 and, in 1980, constituted the most commonplace
event."[11]

European and American women began wearing shirts in 1860, when the
[Garibaldi shirt](Garibaldi_shirt "wikilink"), a red shirt as worn by
the freedom fighters under [Giuseppe
Garibaldi](Giuseppe_Garibaldi "wikilink"), was popularized by [Empress
Eugénie](Eugénie_de_Montijo "wikilink") of France.[12][13] At the end of
the nineteenth century, the *[Century
Dictionary](Century_Dictionary "wikilink")* described an ordinary shirt
as "of cotton, with linen bosom, wristbands and cuffs prepared for
stiffening with starch, the collar and wristbands being usually separate
and adjustable".

The first documented appearance of the expression "To give the shirt off
one's back", happened in 1771 as an idiom that indicates extreme
desperation or generosity and is still in common usage. In 1827 Hannah
Montague, a housewife in upstate New York, invents the [detachable
collar](detachable_collar "wikilink"). Tired of constantly washing her
husband's entire shirt when only the collar needed it, she cut off his
collars and devised a way of attaching them to the neckband after
washing. It wasn't until the 1930s that [collar
stays](collar_stays "wikilink") became popular, although these early
accessories resembled tie clips more than the small collar stiffeners
available today. They connected the collar points to the necktie,
keeping them in place [14]

## Parts of shirt

Many terms are used to describe and differentiate types of shirts (and
upper-body garments in general) and their construction. The smallest
differences may have significance to a cultural or occupational group.
Recently, (late twentieth century, into the twenty-first century) it has
become common to use tops as a form of advertisement. Many of these
distinctions apply to other upper-body garments, such as
[coats](Coat_(clothing) "wikilink") and [sweaters](sweaters "wikilink").

### Shoulders and arms

#### Sleeves

Shirts may:

-   have no covering of the shoulders or arms – a [tube
    top](tube_top "wikilink") (not reaching higher than the armpits,
    staying in place by elasticity)
-   have only shoulder straps, such as [spaghetti
    straps](spaghetti_strap "wikilink")
-   cover the shoulders, but without [sleeves](sleeve "wikilink")
-   have shoulderless sleeves, short or long, with or without shoulder
    straps, that expose the shoulders, but cover the rest of the arm
    from the biceps and triceps down to at least the elbow
-   have short sleeves, varying from cap sleeves (covering only the
    shoulder and not extending below the armpit) to half sleeves (elbow
    length), with some having quarter-length sleeves (reaching to a
    point that covers half of the biceps and triceps area)
-   have three-quarter-length sleeves (reaching to a point between the
    elbow and the wrist)
-   have long sleeves (reaching a point to the wrist to a little beyond
    wrist)

#### Cuffs

Shirts with long sleeves may further be distinguished by the
[cuffs](cuff "wikilink"):

-   no [buttons](button_(clothing) "wikilink") – a closed placket cuff
-   buttons (or analogous fasteners such as
    [snaps](snap_fastener "wikilink")) – single or multiple. A single
    button or pair aligned parallel with the [cuff](cuff "wikilink") hem
    is considered a [button cuff](button_cuff "wikilink"). Multiple
    buttons aligned perpendicular to the [cuff](cuff "wikilink") hem, or
    parallel to the [placket](placket "wikilink") constitute a [barrel
    cuff](barrel_cuff "wikilink").
-   buttonholes designed for [cufflinks](cufflink "wikilink")
    -   a [French cuff](French_cuff "wikilink"), where the end half of
        the [cuff](cuff "wikilink") is folded over the
        [cuff](cuff "wikilink") itself and fastened with a
        [cufflink](cufflink "wikilink"). This type of
        [cuff](cuff "wikilink") has four buttons and a short
        [placket](placket "wikilink").
    -   more formally, a link cuff – fastened like a [French
        cuff](French_cuff "wikilink"), except is not folded over, but
        instead hemmed, at the edge of the sleeve.
-   asymmetrical designs, such as one-shoulder, one-sleeve or with
    sleeves of different lengths.

### Lower hem

-   hanging to the [waist](waist "wikilink")
-   leaving the [belly button](navel "wikilink") area
    [bare](Nudity "wikilink") (much more common for women than for men).
    See [halfshirt](halfshirt "wikilink").
-   covering the [crotch](crotch "wikilink")
-   covering part of the legs (essentially this is a
    [dress](dress "wikilink"); however, a piece of clothing is perceived
    either as a shirt (worn with [trousers](trousers "wikilink")) or as
    a dress (in [Western culture](Western_culture "wikilink") mainly
    worn by women)).
-   going to the floor (as a pajama shirt)

### Body

-   vertical opening on the front side, all the way down, with
    [buttons](Button_(clothing) "wikilink") or
    [zipper](zipper "wikilink"). When fastened with buttons, this
    opening is often called the [placket front](Placket "wikilink").
-   similar opening, but in back.
-   left and right front side not separable, put on over the head; with
    regard to upper front side opening:
    -   V-shaped permanent opening on the top of the front side
    -   no opening at the upper front side
    -   vertical opening on the upper front side with buttons or zipper
        -   men's shirts are often buttoned on the right whereas women's
            are often buttoned on the left.

### Neck

-   with polo-neck
-   with "scoop" neck
-   with v-neck but no collar
-   with plunging neck
-   with open or tassel neck
-   with [collar](collar_(clothing) "wikilink")
    -   windsor collar or **spread collar** – a dressier collar designed
        with a wide distance between points (the **spread**) to
        accommodate the [windsor knot](windsor_knot "wikilink") tie. The
        standard business collar.
    -   tab collar – a collar with two small fabric tabs that fasten
        together behind a tie to maintain collar spread.
    -   [wing collar](wing_collar "wikilink") – best suited for the bow
        tie, often only worn for very formal occasions.
    -   straight collar – or **point collar**, a version of the windsor
        collar that is distinguished by a narrower spread to better
        accommodate the [four-in-hand
        knot](four-in-hand_knot "wikilink"), [pratt
        knot](pratt_knot "wikilink"), and the half-windsor knot. A
        moderate dress collar.
    -   [button-down collar](button-down_collar "wikilink") – A collar
        with buttons that fasten the points or tips to a shirt. The most
        casual of collars worn with a tie.
    -   [band collar](band_collar "wikilink") – essentially the lower
        part of a normal collar, first used as the original collar to
        which a separate collarpiece was attached. Rarely seen in modern
        fashion. Also casual.
    -   [turtle neck collar](Polo_neck "wikilink") – A collar that
        covers most of the throat.
-   without collar
    -   -   V-neck no collar – The neckline protrudes down the chest and
            to a point, creating a "V"-looking neckline.

### Other features

-   **[pockets](pocket "wikilink")** – how many (if any), where, and
    with regard to closure: not closable, just a flap, or with a
    [button](Button_(clothing) "wikilink") or
    [zipper](zipper "wikilink").
-   with or without [hood](Hood_(headgear) "wikilink")

Some combinations are not applicable, e.g. a tube top cannot have a
collar.

## Measures and sizes

The main measures for a jacket are:

-   Shoulders
-   Bust
-   Waist
-   Hip
-   Sleeve
-   Length, from the neck to the waist or hip.

### Sizes

## Types of fabric

There are two main categories of fibres used: natural fibre and man-made
fibre (synthetics or petroleum based). Some natural fibres are linen,
the first used historically, [hemp](hemp "wikilink"),
[cotton](cotton "wikilink"), the most used, [ramie](ramie "wikilink"),
[wool](wool "wikilink"), [silk](silk "wikilink") and more recently
[bamboo](bamboo "wikilink") or [soya](Soy_fabric "wikilink"). Some
synthetic fibres are [polyester](polyester "wikilink"),
[tencel](tencel "wikilink"), [viscose](viscose "wikilink"), etc.
Polyester mixed with cotton (poly-cotton) is often used. Fabrics for
shirts are called shirtings. The four main weaves for shirtings are
[plain weave](plain_weave "wikilink"),
[oxford](oxford_(cloth) "wikilink"), [twill](twill "wikilink") and
[satin](satin "wikilink"). [Broadcloth](Broadcloth "wikilink"),
[poplin](poplin "wikilink") and [end-on-end](end-on-end "wikilink") are
variations of the plain weave. After weaving,
[finishing](finishing_(textiles) "wikilink") can be applied to the
fabric.

## Shirts and politics

In the 1920s and 1930s, [fascists](fascists "wikilink") wore different
coloured shirts:

-   [Black shirts](Black_shirts "wikilink") were used by the [Italian
    fascists](Italian_Fascism "wikilink"), and in Britain, Finland and
    Germany and Croatia. The party leaders of [Dravidar
    Kazhagam](Dravidar_Kazhagam "wikilink") in India wear only black
    shirts to symbolise atheism.
-   [Brownshirts](Brownshirts "wikilink") were worn by German Nazis of
    the SA.
-   The [Blueshirts](Blueshirts "wikilink") was a fascist movement in
    Ireland and Canada, and the colour of the Portuguese *[Nacional
    Sindicalistas](National_Syndicalists_(Portugal) "wikilink")*, the
    Spanish *[Falange Española](Falange_Española "wikilink")*, the
    French *[Solidarité Française](Solidarité_Française "wikilink")*,
    and the Chinese [Blue Shirts
    Society](Blue_Shirts_Society "wikilink").
-   [Green shirts](Greenshirts_(disambiguation) "wikilink") were used in
    Hungary, Ireland, Romania, Brazil and Portugal.
-   *[Camisas Doradas](Camisas_Doradas "wikilink")* (golden shirts) were
    used in [Mexico](Mexico "wikilink").
-   Red shirts were worn by the racist and antisemitic Bulgarian
    [Ratniks](Ratniks "wikilink").
-   [Silver Shirts](Silver_Shirts "wikilink") were worn in the United
    States of America.
-   Grey shirts were worn by members of the [Fatherland
    League](Fatherland_League_(Norway) "wikilink") in Norway.

In addition, [red shirts](redshirt_(disambiguation) "wikilink") have
been used to symbolize a variety of different political groups,
including [Garibaldi](Garibaldi "wikilink")'s Italian revolutionaries,
nineteenth-century American street gangs, and
[socialist](socialist "wikilink") militias in Spain and Mexico during
the 1930s.

Different colored shirts signified the major opposing sides that
featured prominently in the [2008 Thai political
crisis](2008_Thai_political_crisis "wikilink"), with red having been
worn by the supporters of the populist [People's Power
Party](People's_Power_Party_(Thailand) "wikilink") (PPP), and yellow
being worn by the supporters of the royalist and anti-[Thaksin
Shinawatra](Thaksin_Shinawatra "wikilink") movement the [People's
Alliance for Democracy](People's_Alliance_for_Democracy "wikilink")
(PAD). Each side is commonly referred to as the 'red shirts' and 'yellow
shirts' respectively, though the later opponents of the later Thaksin
supporting groups have largely ceased wearing yellow shirts to protest
rallies.

In the UK, the [Social Credit](Social_Credit "wikilink") movement of the
thirties wore green shirts.
