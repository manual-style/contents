bringing the garment of Nessus to [Hercules](Hercules "wikilink") (as
Heracles was known in [Roman mythology](Roman_mythology "wikilink")),
woodcut by [Hans Sebald Beham](Hans_Sebald_Beham "wikilink"), circa
1542-1548.\]\] In [Greek mythology](Greek_mythology "wikilink"), the
**Shirt of Nessus**, **Tunic of Nessus**, **Nessus-robe**, or **Nessus'
shirt** was the poisoned shirt that killed
[Heracles](Heracles "wikilink"). It was once a popular reference in
literature. In [folkloristics](folkloristics "wikilink"), it is
considered an instance of the "[poison dress](poison_dress "wikilink")"
motif.[1]

## Mythology

Fearing that Heracles had taken a new lover in [Iole](Iole "wikilink"),
his wife [Deianeira](Deianeira "wikilink") gives him the "shirt"
(actually a [chiton](chiton_(costume) "wikilink")), which was stained
with the blood of the centaur [Nessus](Nessus_(mythology) "wikilink").
She had been tricked by the dying Nessus into believing it would serve
as a potion to ensure her husband's faithfulness.[2] In fact, it
contained the venom of the [Lernaean Hydra](Lernaean_Hydra "wikilink")
with which Heracles had poisoned the arrow he used to kill Nessus. When
Heracles puts it on, the Hydra's venom begins to cook him alive, and to
escape this unbearable pain he builds a funeral pyre and throws himself
on it.

Metaphorically, it represents "a source of misfortune from which there
is no escape; a fatal present; anything that wounds the
susceptibilities"[3] or a "destructive or expiatory force or
influence".[4]

## Historical references

### Münster Rebellion

During the [anabaptist](anabaptist "wikilink") [Münster
Rebellion](Münster_Rebellion "wikilink") of 1534, a fifteen-year-old
girl named Hille Feyken (or Feiken) attempted to deceive Münster's
Prince-Bishop Franz von Waldeck who had been commanding a protracted
siege of the city. Her plan was to pretend to defect and entice the
Bishop with information about the cities' defenses while giving him a
handsome shirt soaked in poison. Before her plan could be carried out
she was betrayed by another defector, who warned the bishop, and Feyken
was tortured and then killed.

### Hitler plot

Major-General [Henning von Tresckow](Henning_von_Tresckow "wikilink"),
one of the primary conspirators in the [July 20
plot](July_20_plot "wikilink") to assassinate [Adolf
Hitler](Adolf_Hitler "wikilink"), famously referred to the "Robe of
Nessus" following the realization that the assassination plot had failed
and that he and others involved in the conspiracy would lose their lives
as a result: "None of us can complain about our own deaths. Everyone who
joined our circle put on the 'Robe of Nessus'." [5]

### William Shakespeare

In Act 4.12 of [Shakespeare](Shakespeare "wikilink")'s play *[Antony and
Cleopatra](Antony_and_Cleopatra "wikilink")*, [Mark
Antony](Mark_Antony "wikilink") is in a rage after losing the [Battle of
Actium](Battle_of_Actium "wikilink") and exclaims, "The shirt of Nessus
is upon me."

### Alexandre Dumas

In his work *[The Count of Monte
Cristo](The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo "wikilink")*, after Benedetto reveals
in court that the crown prosecutor Monsieur de Villefort was his
illegitimate father, he (de Villefort) forfeits his job and he removes
his robes because it was a burden and torment to him, using the shirt of
Nessus as a metaphor.

### T.S. Eliot

In section IV of his poem "Little Gidding", the final poem of *Four
Quartets*, Eliot alludes to the Nessus myth and the Herculean "[Shirt of
Flame](Shirt_of_Flame "wikilink")" in his lines:

> ... Love is the unfamiliar Name
> Behind the hands that wove
> The intolerable shirt of flame
> Which human power cannot remove.
> ...

### John Barth

*The Shirt of Nessus* (1952) is the title of the master's
[thesis](thesis "wikilink") of noted American
[postmodern](postmodern "wikilink") novelist [John
Barth](John_Barth "wikilink"). Written for the Writing Seminars program
at [Johns Hopkins University](Johns_Hopkins_University "wikilink"),
which Barth himself later ran, *The Shirt of Nessus* is not a
dissertation, but rather a short [novel](novel "wikilink") or
[novella](novella "wikilink"). It can be considered Barth's first
full-length fictional work, and it also is likely to remain his most
elusive. Barth, not unlike a fair number of other authors, has revealed
himself to be embarrassed by his early unpublished work—in his case,
most work before *[The Floating Opera](The_Floating_Opera "wikilink")*.
*The Shirt of Nessus* is briefly referenced in both of Barth's
nonfiction collections, *[The Friday Book](The_Friday_Book "wikilink")*
and *[Further Fridays](Further_Fridays "wikilink")*, but little is known
of its actual content. The only known copies not held by the author were
kept in the Johns Hopkins school library and the Writing Seminars
Department thesis copies, but recent inquiries by devoted Barth fans
have shown that the copy held by the Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins
disappeared in the mid-1960s, while the other seems to have mysteriously
"walked out" of the school's special collections division of the
library. It is the opinion of some notable JHU faculty members who
occasionally talk to Barth that he may have been the mastermind behind
these disappearances himself. While that remains speculation, when the
special collections division notified Barth in 2002 (when the volume was
first found to be missing), Barth responded that he "was not altogether
unhappy the library no longer had a copy". Update: Novelist and scholar
David Morell, in the updated, e-book edition of his study of Barth *John
Barth: An Introduction*, notes that he long ago obtained a photocopy of
Barth's "The Shirt of Nessus."

### Robert Duncan

In the "Introduction" to *[Bending the
Bow](Bending_the_Bow "wikilink")*: "[Pound](Ezra_Pound "wikilink")
sought coherence in The Cantos and comes in Canto 116 to lament 'and I
cannot make it cohere.' But the 'SPLENDOUR, IT ALL COHERES' of the
poet's Herakles in The Women of Trachis is a key or recognition of a
double meaning that turns in the lock of the Nessus shirt."

In Audit/Poetry IV.3, issue featuring [Robert
Duncan](Robert_Duncan_(poet) "wikilink"), in his long polemic with
[Robin Blaser](Robin_Blaser "wikilink")'s translation of The Chimeres of
[Gerard de Nerval](Gerard_de_Nerval "wikilink"), which Duncan believes
deliberately and fatally omit the mystical and gnostic overtones of the
original, Duncan writes: "The mystical doctrine of neo-Pythagorean
naturalism has become like a Nessus shirt to the translator, and in the
translation we hear Heracles' tortured cry from Pound's version of the
Women of Trachis from Sophokles: 'it all coheres.'"

### Hyam Plutzik

In [Hyam Plutzik](Hyam_Plutzik "wikilink")'s poem "Portrait", which
appears in his collection *[Apples From
Shinar](Apples_From_Shinar "wikilink")*, the poet writes of a
Jewish-American character in the late 1950s who has successfully
assimilated, and is able to "ignore the monster, the mountain—/A few
thousand years of history." Except for one problem, "one ill-fitting
garment…The shirt, the borrowed shirt, /The Greek shirt." The last line
reveals the "Greek shirt" is "a shirt by Nessus."

### Other appearances in fiction

-   In [Robertson Davies](Robertson_Davies "wikilink")'s novel *[Fifth
    Business](Fifth_Business "wikilink")*, Dunstan buys an expensive
    silk shirt at a cost beyond his means. He purchases it out of envy
    for his rival, Boy Staunton, who is living a life of wealth while
    attending the same university. "It burned me like the shirt of
    Nessus, but I wore it to rags, to get my money out of it, garment of
    the guilty luxury that it was."
-   In [H. Rider Haggard](H._Rider_Haggard "wikilink")'s *[Montezuma's
    Daughter](Montezuma's_Daughter "wikilink")*, when Otomie the
    princess is made to wear the garb of a low-class woman in order to
    escape imprisonment, the narrator states that "for her proud heart,
    that dress was the very shirt of Nessus."
-   In [James Branch Cabell](James_Branch_Cabell "wikilink")'s
    *[Jurgen](Jurgen,_A_Comedy_of_Justice "wikilink")*, the title
    character dons the shirt of Nessus and is transported by it on his
    travels, in the end of the story he is allowed to take it off, in
    contradiction to the usual conventions.
-   Also in [Mihai Eminescu's](Mihai_Eminescu "wikilink") poem, "Ode (In
    ancient meter)", \[1883, Romanian to English\]



Or like Hercules by his garment poisoned;

By my own illusion consumed I'm wailing

On my own grim pyre in flames I'm melting...

-   In [Patrick O'Brian](Patrick_O'Brian "wikilink")'s novel *[The
    Surgeon's Mate](The_Surgeon's_Mate "wikilink")*, [Stephen
    Maturin](Recurring_characters_in_the_Aubrey–Maturin_series "wikilink")
    reflects on his friend Sir Joseph Blain's lament for his diminished
    sexual appetite. Blaine comments “You are a younger man than I am,
    Maturin, and it may be that you do not know from experience that the
    absence of torment may be a worse torment still: you may wish to
    throw a hair shirt aside, not realizing that it is the hair shirt
    alone that keeps you warm. 'A Nessus' Shirt might be more apt' said
    Stephen, quite unheard."
-   In [Mary Renault](Mary_Renault "wikilink")'s novel *[The
    Charioteer](The_Charioteer "wikilink")*, the matron of the ward of
    the military hospital where Laurie 'Spud' Odell is convalescing is
    introduced as follows:



Matron had just arrived, and done a round. She came poking into the
ward, her petticoat showing slightly, defensively frigid; she had been
promoted beyond her dreams and it had been a Nessus' shirt to her.
Homesick for her little country nursing home, she peered down the line
of beds, noting with dismay how many men were up and at large, rough men
with rude, cruel laughter, who wrote things on walls, who talked about
women, who got VD (but then one was able to transfer them elsewhere).
She was wretched, but her career was booming.

-   In [Rick Riordan](Rick_Riordan "wikilink")'s *[Percy
    Jackson](Percy_Jackson "wikilink")* series of books a vague
    reference is made to the Shirt of Nessus as the brothers Travis and
    Connor Stoll give a T-shirt coated in Centaur blood to one of
    Artemis' Hunters. While in this telling the pain caused is not
    insufferable, the immortal hunter was laid up with a bad case of
    hives as a result of the brothers' prank.
-   In [Gene Wolfe](Gene_Wolfe "wikilink")'s *[Book of the New
    Sun](Book_of_the_New_Sun "wikilink")* series, the city from which
    Severian, the main character, originates is called Nessus. The main
    character himself is referred to as "The New Sun", and ultimately
    his attempt to revive the Urth/Earth with a new sun causes a
    gravitational distortion that floods the whole of the Earth and
    destroys his home city.
-   In [Assia Djebar](Assia_Djebar "wikilink")'s *[Fantasia: An Algerian
    Cavalcade](Fantasia:_An_Algerian_Cavalcade "wikilink")* the author
    assumes her own voice and writes that acquiring and using the French
    language has been like donning the Shirt of Nessus.
-   In [Yasmina Khadra](Yasmina_Khadra "wikilink")'s *[The Swallows of
    Kabul](The_Swallows_of_Kabul "wikilink")* a character despising the
    use of the burqa by Muslim extremists compares it to donning the
    Shirt of Nessus
-   [Lucy Larcom](Lucy_Larcom "wikilink")'s anti-war and anti-slavery
    ballad "Weaving" is a soliloquy of a northern factory woman working
    at her loom who compares the cloth she weaves with a Nessus-robe for
    the Southern slave women who suffered to produce the cotton.

#### References in Film and Television

-   In the 1994 movie *[Hercules in the
    Underworld](Hercules_in_the_Underworld "wikilink")*, similar to the
    original myth, Nessus tricks Deianeira into believing his blood will
    keep Hercules faithful. When she suspects Hercules is having an
    affair with Iole, she sends him a cloak smeared with the blood. When
    he puts it on, it comes to life and tries to strangle him, but he
    manages to tear it off and destroy it.
-   In an episode of the crime drama *[Criminal
    Minds](Criminal_Minds "wikilink")*, "*Heathridge Manor*", where the
    BAU hunts a serial killer who kills women with dresses (based on
    ones used in a local production of *[The Merry Wives of
    Windsor](The_Merry_Wives_of_Windsor "wikilink")*) soaked in
    nicotine. Spencer Reid mentions the Shirt of Nessus as an example of
    poisoned clothing.
-   In the 2010 movie *[Prince of Persia: The Sands of
    Time](Prince_of_Persia:_The_Sands_of_Time_(film) "wikilink")*, King
    Sharaman is assassinated by a gifted poisoned robe.

### References in non-fiction

-   It is also the title of a 1956 non-fiction book dealing with
    anti-Nazi groups in Germany during [World War
    II](World_War_II "wikilink").
-   The Polish dissident writer [Jan Józef
    Lipski](Jan_Józef_Lipski "wikilink") published a collection of
    essays called *Tunika Nessosa* ("The Shirt of Nessos"), dealing
    with, and critical of, Polish Catholic nationalism. Lipski called
    nationalism the shirt of Nessos, which destroys the cultural genius
    of a nation.
-   In [Thomas Merton](Thomas_Merton "wikilink")'s *[The Seven Storey
    Mountain, an Autobiography of
    Faith](The_Seven_Storey_Mountain "wikilink")*, he writes about the
    false humility of hell:



There is a certain kind of humility in hell which is one of the worst
things in hell, and which is infinitely far from the humility of the
saints, which is peace. The false humility of hell is an unending,
burning shame at the inescapable stigma of our sins. The sins of the
damned are felt by them as a vesture of intolerable insults from which
they cannot escape. Nessus shirts that burn them up forever and which
they can never throw off.

As referenced in Robert Massie's tome *Catherine The Great, A Portrait
Of A Woman*, Catherine's former lover, Stanislau Poniatowski the King of
Poland, writes to Catherine that the crown she procured for him would
become a shirt of Nessus: "I shall be burned alive and my end
frightful." Catherine's support for dissident Russian Orthodox
believers, a Polish minority, against the majority Catholic rulers
created an untenable situation in Polish politics that led to many
uprisings against the Russian interference in Polish domestic squabbles.

-   In *Lily Briscoe: A Self Portrait*, An Autobiography by [Mary
    Meigs](Mary_Meigs "wikilink"), she writes: "The ideas people have of
    us are saturated with a kind of burning poison, like the shirt of
    Nessus, and they stick to the skin of our "selves," for although
    there is an affirmative voice that cries, "Can't you see that this
    is my real self?" another self-doubting voice is slyly whispering,
    "Could it be true?"
