A **shirtdress** is a style of women's [dress](/dress "wikilink") that
borrows details from a man's [shirt](/Dress_shirt "wikilink"). These can
include a [collar](/Collar_(clothing) "wikilink"), a
[button](/button "wikilink") [front](/Placket "wikilink"), or
[cuffed](/cuff "wikilink") [sleeves](/sleeve "wikilink"). Often, these
dresses are made up in crisp fabrics including
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink") or [silk](/silk "wikilink"), much like a
men's [dress shirt](/dress_shirt "wikilink") would be. As they are
typically cut without a [seam](/Sewing "wikilink") at the waist, these
dresses often have a looser fit, usually relying on a
[belt](/Belt_(clothing) "wikilink") to define the waist. Button fronts
and a forgiving fit make this a flattering look for most [body
types](/body_types "wikilink").

## History

[thumb\|upright=0.6\|left\|A vintage shirtdress,

1990s shirt-dress.](/File:ERHW_Porch1.jpg "wikilink") Shirt dresses were
sometimes called "shirtwaist dresses" when they were fashionable during
the 1950s. The 1950s version of the shirtdress was launched as part of
[Christian Dior](/Christian_Dior "wikilink")'s post–World War II "[New
Look](/Christian_Dior_S.A.#The_.22New_Look.22 "wikilink")" couture
designs, with a full skirt held up by wearing a
[crinoline](/crinoline "wikilink").[1] They often featured a notched
collar, and elbow-length sleeves with cuffs. More informal versions of
the shirtdress, made of cotton, but retaining the full skirt and collar,
became a staple part of many women's wardrobes during the 1950s, with
designers such as [Anne Fogarty](/Anne_Fogarty "wikilink") becoming
known for their versions of this style.[2] A 1957 issue of
*[Life](/Life_(magazine) "wikilink")* magazine includes a photo of a
typical cotton shirtdress selling for $25 in New York City.[3]

A variation of the original shirtdress is the "**T-shirt dress**".
T-shirt dresses began being produced in the 1960s, and are simply an
elongated version of a T-shirt.[4]
