A **talismanic shirt** (or **talisman shirt**; ) is a worn textile
[talismanic object](talismanic_object "wikilink"). Talismanic shirts are
found throughout the [Islamic world](Islamic_world "wikilink"). The
shirts can be grouped to four types which differ in style and the
symbols used: an [Ottoman](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink"), a
[Safavid](Safavid "wikilink"), a [Mughal](Mughal_Empire "wikilink") and
a West African one.[1]

The earliest surviving examples were made approximately in 15th
century[2], though the tradition of talismanic shirts might be much
older. In the Surah [Yusuf](Yusuf_(sura) "wikilink") of the
[Quran](Quran "wikilink") a shirt of the prophet
[Yusuf](Joseph_in_Islam "wikilink") is described as giving him
protection and even miracle-working. He hands it over so it can heal the
blindness of his father [Yaqub](Jacob_in_Islam "wikilink"): .

The shirts may be [inscribed](inscription "wikilink") with verses from
Quran, names of [Allah](Allah "wikilink") and of prophets and with
numbers. They may carry images or symbols, e.g. astrological ones. The
inscribed names are believed to be capable of offering protection and
guidance to the carrier.[3] Although talismanic shirts can be worn to
protect against many evils most of them seem to be intended as a shield
in battle.[4]
