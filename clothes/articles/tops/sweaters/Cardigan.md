A **cardigan** is a type of knitted [garment](garment "wikilink") that
has an open front.[1]

## Description

Commonly cardigans have buttons: garments that are tied are instead
considered a robe. A more modern version of the garment has no buttons
and hangs open by design. By contrast, a [pullover](Sweater "wikilink")
(or sweater) does not open in front but must be "pulled over" the head
to be worn. It may be machine- or hand-[knitted](knitting "wikilink").
Traditionally, cardigans were made of [wool](wool "wikilink") but can
now be made of [cotton](cotton "wikilink"), [synthetic
fibers](synthetic_fiber "wikilink"), or any combination thereof.

## History

The cardigan was named after [James Brudenell, 7th Earl of
Cardigan](James_Brudenell,_7th_Earl_of_Cardigan "wikilink"), a [British
Army](British_Army "wikilink") [Major General](Major_General "wikilink")
who led the [Charge of the Light
Brigade](Charge_of_the_Light_Brigade "wikilink") at the [Battle of
Balaclava](Battle_of_Balaclava "wikilink") during the [Crimean
War](Crimean_War "wikilink").[2] It is modelled after the knitted wool
[waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink") that British officers supposedly wore
during the war. The legend of the event and the fame that Lord Cardigan
achieved after the war led to the rise of the garment's popularity –
supposedly, Brudenell invented the cardigan after noticing that the
tails of his coat had accidentally been burnt off in a fireplace.[3][4]
The name "Cardigan" is an anglicised variation of the
[Welsh](Welsh_language "wikilink") placename
[Ceredigion](Ceredigion "wikilink").

The term originally referred only to a knitted sleeveless
[vest](vest "wikilink"), but expanded to other types of garment over
time. [Coco Chanel](Coco_Chanel "wikilink") is credited with
popularizing cardigans for women because "she hated how tight-necked
men's sweaters messed up her hair when she pulled them over her
head."[5] The garment is mostly associated with the college culture of
the Roaring Twenties and early 1930s, being also popular throughout the
1950s, the 1970s and the 1990s. Cardigans have also regained popularity
during the [2010s](2010s "wikilink").

## Usage

Plain cardigans are often worn over shirts and inside [suit
jackets](Suit_(clothing) "wikilink") as a less formal version of the
[waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink") or vest that restrains the
[necktie](necktie "wikilink") when the jacket has been removed. Its
versatility means it can be worn in casual or formal settings and in any
season, but it is most popular during cool weather.

Monochromatic cardigans, in sleeved or vest form, may be viewed as a
conservative fashion staple. As an item of formal clothing for any
gender, it is worn over a button-down [dress
shirt](dress_shirt "wikilink"). A less formal style is wearing a
[T-shirt](T-shirt "wikilink") underneath.
