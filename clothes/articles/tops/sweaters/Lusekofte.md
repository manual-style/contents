The **lusekofte** (, *lice jacket*), also called the **Setesdalsgenser**
(*[Setesdal](Setesdal "wikilink") sweater*) is a traditional
[Norwegian](Norway "wikilink") sweater, dating from the 19th century.

The original sweater features a black and white design, the name
referring to the isolated black stitches.[1] They may also feature
[selburose](selburose "wikilink") designs. In recent times additional
color is sometimes given to this black and white sweater by woven
ribbons or bands of black woolen fabric embroidered in the type of
colorful designs also found in the [bunads](bunad "wikilink") and in
[rosemaling](rosemaling "wikilink") around the neck and along the front
opening. These front opening are usually closed by a row of pewter or
silver clasps.

After the lusekofte was discovered by tourists in the 1920s, it became
very popular and today they are made in are many different patterns and
colours[2] in addition to the traditional Setesdal sweater.

The lusekofte is casual attire, traditionally mostly worn by men.
