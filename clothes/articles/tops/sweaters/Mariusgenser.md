![](Mariusgenser.jpg "fig:Mariusgenser.jpg")\]\] **Marius Sweaters** ()
are [Norwegian-style knitted](Norwegian_knitting "wikilink")
[sweaters](sweaters "wikilink") with patterns inspired by traditional
Setesdal sweater (), but without [lice](Lusekofte "wikilink"). While the
traditional sweaters used the natural colors of sheep
[wool](wool "wikilink") - black, gray, brown and white - Marius sweater
designs incorporated colors, with the most common being red, white and
blue, the colors of the [Norwegian flag](Norwegian_flag "wikilink").

## Origin

The origin of the sweater has been subject to dispute in media. Designer
said she designed the pattern in 1953, influenced by traditional
Norwegian knitting patterns found in the 1929 book *Norske
Strikkemønstre* (Norwegian knitting patterns) by Annichen Sibbern. She
sold the legal rights to distribute the hand-knit pattern the same year
to for 100 [Norwegian kroner](Norwegian_krone "wikilink").[1] Designer
said she designed the pattern in the later 1920s, also inspired by the
book by Sibbern, and that she in the beginning of 1950s had hired women
who hand-knitted the sweater for sale in her shop. Erisen's
daughter-in-law Bente Eriksen has said she was present when Dale visited
Bitten Eriksen to learn the pattern[2] Dale strongly disputed Bitten
Eriksen's version, as does Dale's daughter, , who currently holds the
rights to the pattern for most commercial use.[3]

## Popularity

Textile arts expert Annemor Møst estimated in 1999 that about 3,5
million copies of the knitting pattern had been sold and in 2008
estimated the number to be around 5 million and the number of sweaters
that has been knitted based on the design as possibly multiple times
more.[4] Sandnes Uldvarefabrik estimated in 2011 that it had sold over
five million copies of the pattern in a variety of color
combinations.[5][6]

Then Crown Prince, now King [Harald V](Harald_V_of_Norway "wikilink")
and [Gro Harlem Brundtland](Gro_Harlem_Brundtland "wikilink") are among
those who have worn the sweater publicly.[7]
