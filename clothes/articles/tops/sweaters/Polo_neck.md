![](Col_roulé,_porté_plié.jpg "fig:Col_roulé,_porté_plié.jpg") A **polo
neck**, **roll-neck**[1] ([UK](United_Kingdom "wikilink")),
**turtleneck** ([US](United_States "wikilink"),
[Canada](Canada "wikilink")), or **skivvy**
([Australia](Australia "wikilink"), [New
Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink"), [US](United_States "wikilink")) is a
garment—usually a [sweater](sweater "wikilink")—with a close-fitting,
round, and high part similar to a [collar](collar_(clothing) "wikilink")
that folds over and covers the [neck](neck "wikilink"). It can also
refer to the type of [neckline](neckline "wikilink"), the style of
collar itself, or be used as an [adjective](adjective "wikilink") ("polo
necked").

A simpler variant of the standard polo neck is the mock polo neck (or
mock turtleneck), that resembles the polo neck with the soft fold at its
top and the way it stands up around the neck, but both ends of the tube
forming the collar are sewn to the neckline. This is mainly used to
achieve the appearance of a polo neck where the fabric would fray, roll,
or otherwise behave badly unless sewn. The mock polo neck clings to the
neck smoothly, is easy to manufacture, and works well with a zip
closure.

## History

### Europe

Polo neck-like garments have been worn for hundreds of years, dating at
least to the 15th century.

From the late 19th century on, polo necks were commonly worn by menial
workers, athletes, sailors and naval officers. Since the middle of the
20th century [black](black "wikilink") polo necks have been closely
associated with radical [academics](academics "wikilink"),
[philosophers](philosopher "wikilink"), [artists](artist "wikilink") and
[intellectuals](intellectual "wikilink").[2][3] The polo neck jumper
became an iconic symbol of the French philosopher [Michel
Foucault](Michel_Foucault "wikilink").[4] Polo necks also became a big
fashion for young wealthy men after they were worn by European film
stars [Marcello Mastroianni](Marcello_Mastroianni "wikilink") and [Yves
Montand](Yves_Montand "wikilink").[5]

[Greta Garbo](Greta_Garbo "wikilink") often wore polo necks and trousers
privately, as later [Audrey Hepburn](Audrey_Hepburn "wikilink") would do
in official photographs.

[Vladimir Putin](Vladimir_Putin "wikilink")[6] of
[Russia](Russia "wikilink") and [Andreas
Papandreou](Andreas_Papandreou "wikilink")[7] of
[Greece](Greece "wikilink") are two examples of European statesmen fond
of wearing polo necks.

### United States

Their adoption by [Noël Coward](Noël_Coward "wikilink") in the 1920s
turned polo necks into a brief middle-class fashion trend, and
[feminists](feminism "wikilink") made them into a unisex item. Absorbed
into mainstream American fashion by the mid 20th century, the polo neck
came to be viewed as an anti-[tie](necktie "wikilink"), a smart form of
dress for those who rejected [formal wear](formal_wear "wikilink").
Senator [Ted Kennedy](Ted_Kennedy "wikilink"), pianist/conductor
[Vladimir Ashkenazy](Vladimir_Ashkenazy "wikilink"), conductor [Seiji
Ozawa](Seiji_Ozawa "wikilink"), philosopher [Michel
Foucault](Michel_Foucault "wikilink"), shipping tycoon [Stavros
Niarchos](Stavros_Niarchos "wikilink"), singer [Barry
Manilow](Barry_Manilow "wikilink"), scientist [Carl
Sagan](Carl_Sagan "wikilink"), [Oracle
Corporation](Oracle_Corporation "wikilink") co-founder [Larry
Ellison](Larry_Ellison "wikilink"), [Theranos](Theranos "wikilink")
founder [Elizabeth Holmes](Elizabeth_Holmes "wikilink"), and [Apple
Inc.](Apple_Inc. "wikilink") co-founder [Steve
Jobs](Steve_Jobs "wikilink") were among those often seen in polo necks.

Over time it became a fad among teenage girls, especially in a
lightweight form that emphasised their figures. It was not long before
[Hollywood](Hollywood "wikilink") was also exploiting this image as part
of the [sweater girl](sweater_girl "wikilink") look.

By the late 1950s the "tight turtleneck" had been adopted as part of the
[preppy](preppy "wikilink") style among students, a style emphasising
neatness, tidiness and grooming. This would become an important aspect
of the polo neck's image in the [United
States](United_States "wikilink"). The look would filter through to
Britain and the rest of Europe in a watered-down version.

Very elegant polo necks of [silk](silk "wikilink") or nylon knit,
especially made with French cuffs for formal dress affairs, have also
seen success in American fashion.[8]

## As an alternative to the necktie

Polo necks have historically (and controversially) acted as substitutes
of the traditional and dominant shirt-and-[tie](necktie "wikilink")
look.[10] Some of the fiercest conflicts regarding the polo neck's use
took place in upscale [restaurants](restaurant "wikilink") and in
weddings, where polo necks have been used in violation of the shirt and
tie.
