A **shrug** is a cropped, [cardigan](Cardigan_(sweater) "wikilink")-like
garment with short or long sleeves cut in one with the body, typically
[knitted](knitting "wikilink"), usually for women.[1] Generally, a shrug
covers less of the body than a [vest](vest "wikilink") would, but it is
more tailored than a [shawl](shawl "wikilink"). Shrugs are typically
worn as the outermost layer of an outfit, with a full
[shirt](shirt "wikilink"), [tank top](Sleeveless_shirt "wikilink"), or
[dress](dress "wikilink") beneath.

A shrug covers a small portion of the upper body. Some shrugs are tied
together just below the bustline. Another style is cut off at the sides
and thus little more than a pair of sleeves joined at the back.

A **bolero jacket** or **bolero** (pronounced or in British English and
in American English)[2] is a more formal garment of similar construction
but made of stiffer fabric, essentially a short tailored
[jacket](jacket "wikilink"), inspired by the matador's
[chaquetilla](Traje_de_luces "wikilink"). Like the shrug, the sides of
the bolero only meet at one point.[3]
