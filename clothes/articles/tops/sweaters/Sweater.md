![](Selburose-sweater.jpg "fig:Selburose-sweater.jpg") A **sweater**,
also called a **jumper** in British English,[1] is a piece of clothing,
typically with long sleeves, made of knitted or crocheted material that
covers the upper part of the body. When sleeveless, the garment is often
called a **slipover**.

Sweaters are worn by adults and children of all genders, often over a
[shirt](shirt "wikilink"), [blouse](blouse "wikilink"),
[T-shirt](T-shirt "wikilink"), or other top, but sometimes next to the
skin. Sweaters were traditionally made from [wool](wool "wikilink") but
can now be made of [cotton](cotton "wikilink"), [synthetic
fibers](synthetic_fiber "wikilink"), or any combination of these.

## Etymology

According to British dictionaries, "sweater" is used in British English
in the same sense as in American English but "jumper" is commonly used
instead (though some say that "sweater" is used for heavier ones worn
for warmth).[2][3][4] Oxforddictionaries.com states that in British
usage sweaters are always pulled over the head and jumpers are not
necessarily,[5][6][7] whereas most or all other British dictionaries
disagree and say that sweaters are not necessarily pullovers or even say
that jumpers are always pullovers, i.e. never open in front.[8][9]

So according to most British dictionaries, British usage agrees with
what American dictionaries describe as American English usage, according
to which a sweater is either a pullover or a
[cardigan](cardigan_(sweater) "wikilink") (which opens at the front). In
other words, almost all British dictionaries include cardigans as a type
of sweater but at least one includes cardigans as a type of jumper (i.e.
most British dictionaries consider "sweater" – and at least one
considers "jumper" – to be a [hypernym](hypernym "wikilink") for both
pullovers and cardigans).

## Types and design

![](Hot_dog_sweater_1434172037.jpg "fig:Hot_dog_sweater_1434172037.jpg")
The term "sweater" is a catch-all for a variety of knit garments.
Although the term often refers to a pullover, it can also refer to a
[cardigan](cardigan_(sweater) "wikilink"), a garment that opens and
fastens down the front. Within either group, there is a great variety of
design. Various [necklines](neckline "wikilink") are found, although the
V-neck, turtleneck and the crew neck are the most popular. The hemline
is typically at hip height or slightly longer, just overlapping the
waist of one's pants or skirt, but can vary significantly. It can range
from just below the bust in women's garments to mid-thigh in either sex,
or even longer in a knitted variation of the [poncho](poncho "wikilink")
[shirtdress](shirtdress "wikilink"). The [sleeve](sleeve "wikilink")
length is also variable, ranging from full-length or three-quarters to
short-sleeved, cap sleeves or sleeveless. The front
[seam](style_line "wikilink") or opening of a cardigan allows for
further different styles, such as a [surplice](surplice "wikilink") or a
[bolero jacket](bolero_jacket "wikilink"). All hems may have various
types of borders, such as [picots](picot "wikilink"),
[ribbing](ribbing_(knitting) "wikilink") and frills.

[Knitted fabrics](basic_knitted_fabrics "wikilink") are generally
somewhat [elastic](elasticity_(physics) "wikilink") and have a softer
hand (feel or drape) than woven fabric, sweaters that are more tightly
fitted or have a soft drape may conform well to the body without
requiring [tailoring](tailoring "wikilink") necessary in a woven garment
such as darts, flares and gores. Even when such shaping is used, it can
be knit into the fabric itself, without requiring seams.

Another type is a [sweater vest](sweater_vest "wikilink").

## Nomenclature

![](1940_Trachtenstrickjacke_anagoria.JPG "fig:1940_Trachtenstrickjacke_anagoria.JPG")
![](Islandpullover_004.jpg "fig:Islandpullover_004.jpg")*)\]\]
![](Jumper_altered_PsCSJPG10.jpg "fig:Jumper_altered_PsCSJPG10.jpg") A
sweater with an open front fastened by [buttons](button "wikilink") or a
[zipper](zipper "wikilink") is generally called a
**[cardigan](Cardigan_(sweater) "wikilink")**, but the nomenclature for
other styles in different
[dialects](List_of_dialects_of_the_English_language "wikilink") can be
quite confusing. In [British English](British_English "wikilink"), a
sweater may also be called a pullover, jumper or jersey. In the United
States however, "[jumper](Jumper_(dress) "wikilink")" refers to a style
of women's sleeveless dress, worn over a blouse or shirt, and "jersey"
refers to a knit shirt, especially if part of an athletic uniform. If
sleeveless, such a garment may be called a "slipover" or "tank top" in
British English, while "tank top" in [US English](US_English "wikilink")
refers to a [sleeveless shirt or
undershirt](sleeveless_shirt "wikilink"). In the U.S. a sleeveless
sweater may also be called a [sweater vest](sweater_vest "wikilink"),
especially if it has a V-neck and somewhat formal appearance resembling
a formal vest, a garment known as a [waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink") in
the UK In British English, "vest" refers to an undershirt. In [South
African English](South_African_English "wikilink"), a knitted sweater is
always called a **jersey**, while*sweater*, when used, refers to
a*sweatshirt''. In the sport of [ice hockey](ice_hockey "wikilink"), the
top of a hockey player's uniform had traditionally been a sweater; and
even though modern hockey uniform tops are more commonly a
[jersey](jersey_(clothing) "wikilink") they are typically referred to as
a "hockey sweater," regardless of the style, but frequently, in the U.S.
it is called a hockey "jersey".

## Customary wear

![](Seaman_jumper.JPG "fig:Seaman_jumper.JPG") Thin sweaters may be worn
tucked into the waistband of [trousers](trousers "wikilink"); but
otherwise, men's sweaters are worn untucked. Nonetheless, some
individuals, including some television and film actors, have been known
for wearing tucked-in sweaters.[10]

Sweaters are a versatile item of clothing and can be worn on top of
almost any outfit. Sports sweaters are often worn on tops of sports kit
while traveling to or from a sports ground. Sweaters can be worn with a
[dress shirt](dress_shirt "wikilink") underneath (and optionally a
[tie](Necktie "wikilink")), which has the advantage of allowing the
wearer to have the option of removing the sweater when it is
uncomfortably warm and still looking presentable in many situations.
Layering and the ease with which it allows for temperature regulation is
a major benefit of the sweater as an article of clothing. Various
methods have evolved for conveniently carrying a sweater, once removed.
The three most common approaches are: around the waist (either loin
cloth or knotted in front style) and over the shoulder.

In the late 20th century, the sweater increasingly came to be worn as an
alternative to a shirt when finer materials made them more comfortable
next to the skin.

Some people enjoy wearing Christmas-related sweaters around Christmas
time to get into the festive spirit. Some women's sweaters are meant to
be worn belted; a belt or drawstring is sometimes knitted into the
sweater itself. Leggings are commonly worn with long sweaters or sweater
dresses.

## Care

Sweaters are often maintained by washing or dry cleaning and the use of
a [lint roller](lint_roller "wikilink") or
[pill](Pill_(textile) "wikilink") razor. But airing (and rinsing in pure
water if necessary) is considered better than washing with soap or
another detergent, especially when not all of the natural oil
([lanolin](lanolin "wikilink")) has been removed from the wool. The use
of detergent is in fact detrimental because it removes the lanolin,
which helps the wool to repel and shed dirt as well as water. In fact
sweaters made from unscoured wool, such as some Irish [Aran
jumpers](Aran_jumper "wikilink"), remain wearable even when wet.

## Ice hockey

The [uniforms](Hockey_jersey "wikilink") that present day [ice
hockey](ice_hockey "wikilink") players wear are sometimes referred to as
"sweaters", although they nowadays usually more closely resemble the
jerseys worn in other sports like
[soccer](association_football "wikilink"). This is because original
uniforms were simply sweaters with the team's logo stitched on the
front. However, as technology changed, so did the uniforms as actual
sweaters absorbed too much moisture and became weighed down and
cumbersome throughout the course of a game.

## Sweatshirts

In 1920, [Benjamin Russell Jr.](Benjamin_C._Russell "wikilink"), a
quarterback for the [Alabama Crimson Tide
Football](Alabama_Crimson_Tide_Football "wikilink") team, was tired of
the constant chafing and itching caused by their wool football
uniforms.[11] Russell Jr. worked with his father, who owned a
manufacturing company, to come up with a better option. At the time,
[Russell Manufacturing Company](Russell_Athletic "wikilink") made
garments for women's and children's knit shirts and undergarments.[12]

Knowing the durability and comfort of cotton they created a new practice
jersey that was a modification of a ladies’ [union
suit](union_suit "wikilink") top from thick cotton[13] that was produced
throughout the factory. These loose, collarless pullovers – produced
from women's undergarments to be used as men's football jerseys - would
go on to become an iconic sweatshirt. Russell went on to create a new
division of his factory, focusing solely on the production of
sweatshirts, which became the [Russell Athletic
Company](Russell_Athletic_(brand) "wikilink").

The sweatshirt's potential as a portable advertising tool was discovered
in the 1960s when U.S. universities began printing their names on the
medium. For students and parents alike, university names on sweatshirts
became the preferred casual attire for exhibiting school pride. The
sweatshirt, along with the [T-shirt](T-shirt "wikilink"), provided a
cheap and effective way of disseminating information on a mass scale.
The T-shirt slogan fad of the seventies inevitably translated to
sweatshirts. Recognizing the relative simplicity of customization and
the power of clever graphics combined with catchphrases, sweatshirts
became a vehicle for personal expression for both the designer and the
person wearing them.[14]

Sweatshirts are arguably a type of sweater, but made of a fabric and cut
similar to [sweatpants](sweatpants "wikilink"). A sweatshirt worn with
sweatpants forms a sweatsuit, an exercise outfit designed to raise the
core body temperature and cause [perspiration](perspiration "wikilink")
in order to lose body weight before a weigh-in for a weight-divided
sport. It is fashioned out of a thick, usually cotton jersey material.
Sweatshirts are also almost exclusively casual attire and not dressy as
some other sweaters may be. Sweatshirts may or may not have a hood. A
sweatshirt with a hood is now usually referred to as a
[hoodie](hoodie "wikilink"), although more formal media still use the
term "hooded sweatshirt".
