**Sweater design** is a specialization of [fashion
design](fashion_design "wikilink") in which [knitted](knit "wikilink")
[sweaters](sweater "wikilink") are designed to fulfill certain
aesthetic, functional and commercial criteria. The designer typically
considers factors such as the insulating power of the sweater (and its
resulting warmth for the wearer); the fashion of its colors, patterns,
silhouette and [style lines](style_line "wikilink"), particularly the
[neckline](neckline "wikilink") and
[waistline](waistline_(clothing) "wikilink"); the convenience and
practicality of its cut; and in commercial design, the cost of its
production and the profitability of its [price
point](price_point "wikilink"). Sweater designs are often published in
books and knitting magazines. Sweater design is an old art, but
continues to attract new designers such as [Nicky
Epstein](Nicky_Epstein "wikilink") and [Meg
Swansen](Meg_Swansen "wikilink").

## Criteria

The aim of **sweater design** is a sweater that fulfils certain
criteria. The primary criterion is that its intended wearer wants to
wear it and, in case of commercial sweater design, is willing to buy it
at a commercially feasible [price point](price_point "wikilink").
General secondary criteria include

-   the insulating power, material and breathability of the sweater
    should make its intended wearer physically comfortable;
-   the sweater should be appropriate for the occasion in which it will
    be worn;
-   makes its intended wearer feel fashionably attractive;

To satisfy these secondary criteria, the designer has several tools at
[their](singular_they "wikilink") disposal, such as
[yarns](yarn "wikilink"), [colors](color "wikilink"),
[patterns](pattern "wikilink"), [textures](wikt:texture "wikilink"),
[necklines](neckline "wikilink"), [hemlines](hemline "wikilink"),
[sleeve](sleeve "wikilink") shapes, [style
lines](style_line "wikilink"), [pockets](pocket "wikilink") and
embellishments, as well as the fit of the [garment](clothing "wikilink")
to its intended wearer, the [silhouette](silhouette "wikilink").

-   For commercial sweater design, the production of the sweater must
    also be inexpensive, lest the [price point](price_point "wikilink")
    be too high and make the sweater undesirable. This is generally done
    by simplifying the design so that it can be made by machine; more
    complicated commercial designs are generally hand-knit in pieces
    that are then stitched together. For example, the separate pieces of
    the hand-knit sweaters found in stores are generally knit and
    assembled in different villages in [China](China "wikilink").

Despite the wealth of design techniques and studies of successful
designs, the primary criterion (that the sweater be desired) is not
always achieved, often due to factors beyond the designer's control
including [serendipity](serendipity "wikilink").

## Functional role as criterion

Sweaters are worn in various circumstances. For example, while some
sweaters are worn at fancy dress occasions, others are worn to work, to
religious services, in sporting or outdoors events such as hiking and
camping. Similarly, the choice of a sweater can vary with different
climates and different seasons, even with different times of the day.
The sweater designer will generally target a particular occasion and
temperature, e.g., a bulky, cabled, long-sleeved woolen seater for
camping versus a refined, elegantly simple, short-sleeved cashmere
sweater for white-collar work.

## Comfort criterion

Comfort is paramount; the sweater should make the wearer feel at ease,
in the most general sense. The temperature should be right, the fabric
should "breathe" and should not irritate the skin. The sweater should
hang right and not need constant adjustment; It should fit well and
allow for customary motion without binding (e.g., at the armholes).
Finally, a sweater should not make the wearer feel uncomfortable because
of its "cut" (e.g. showing bra straps or too much cleavage) or general
style (e.g., colors/patterns that the wearer feels are inappropriate).

## Fitting a sweater

![](drop_shoulder_sweater_pattern.png "drop_shoulder_sweater_pattern.png")

The fit of a sweater affects its comfort, its attractiveness and,
sometimes, its practicality (e.g., dangling sleeves can fall into food
or get caught on hooks).

The simplest sweaters (drop sleeve, cylindrical) require six
measurements:

-   circumference around the bust/chest (widest point)
-   circumference (or width) of the neck
-   under-arm length (armhole to sleeve-cuff hem)
-   circumference of the arm at the sleeve-cuff hem
-   back length (vertical distance from back of the neck to lower hem)
-   armhole depth (vertical distance from bottom of armhole to lower
    hem)

![](tapered_sweater_pattern_w_setin_sleeves.png "tapered_sweater_pattern_w_setin_sleeves.png")

A few more measurements usually produce a well-fitted sweater:

-   circumference at the lower hem
-   over-arm length (shoulder to sleeve-cuff hem)
-   circumference of the upper arm near the armhole
-   bust height (vertical distance from back of the neck to bust line)
-   shoulder width (horizontal distance between bony shoulder points,
    measured across back)

![](tailored_sweater_w_waist.png "tailored_sweater_w_waist.png")

For a more tailored look, even more measurements are necessary

-   slope of the shoulders (vertical distance from base of neck to
    shoulder-point line)
-   neck-shoulder length (horizontal distance from base of neck to
    shoulder point)
-   circumference at the waist, the point of largest inward or outward
    curvature
-   waist height (vertical distance from back of the neck to waist line)

Ideally, these measurements will be taken directly from the intended
wearer, since bodies are idiosyncratic and these measurements may vary
independently of one another, e.g., the bust measurement does not
determine the waist or hip measurements, just as the height does not
determine the arm length or shoulder width. Alternatively, the body
measurements may be estimated from clothing that fits the wearer well.
As a last resort, standard measurements such as [EN
13402](EN_13402 "wikilink") or [US standard clothing
sizes](US_standard_clothing_size "wikilink") may be used.

Of course, a sweater need not conform exactly to the wearer's body.
**Ease** may be introduced to make the sweater larger than the body
(oversized), typically by increasing the circumference measurements by
2-6 inches. Different amounts of ease can be introduced at different
points to give the sweater a distinctive
[silhouette](silhouette "wikilink"). For example, a "Gibson-girl" sleeve
is produced by adding much ease to the upper arm and none to the lower
arm, whereas the reverse is true for "bell" sleeves (also called
"bishop" sleeves). Similarly, the bodice can fit loosely in the bust and
tightly at the waist, or the reverse. Negative ease (i.e., *subtracting*
from the body measurements) is also possible to achieve a very
close-fitting look, but more than 2 inches is not recommended.

By making the sweater match the desired measurements, an excellently
fitting sweater can be made. The width of a knitted piece at a given
height should equal the corresponding circumference; for example, if the
desired bust circumference is 38", then the front or back width at that
height should be 19" each. The width of the upper sleeve (just before
the sleeve cap, if any) should likewise equal the desired circumference
of the upper arm.

Having determined the size and shapes of the knitted pieces, the number
of stitches in a row is given by the desired width multiplied by the
knitting gauge (e.g., 5 st/inch). Similarly, the number of rows in a
column may be determined by multiplying the desired height by the
vertical gauge (e.g., 3 rows/inch).

## Shaping

The human body has curvature, but [woven fabric](woven "wikilink") is
flat and has little elasticity. To produce curvature in a smooth
(unruffled) woven fabric, it is necessary to subtract or add wedges of
fabric. Positive curvature (cupping, such as is needed at the bust point
or over the rear) is produced by *subtracting* a wedge (a **dart**) with
the point of the dart almost at the point of desired maximum curvature.
The greater the angle of the wedge, the greater the local curvature.
(The orientation of the dart is unimportant for the curvature, so it can
be chosen to accentuate a style line of the garment.) Similarly,
negative curvature (ruffling/saddle-shaping, as at a skirt hem, lower
back or under the bust) is produced by *adding* a wedge (a **flare**).
Although the base of individual wedges usually lies on a seam, sometimes
wedges occur in pairs (diamonds) that are independent of the seams.
Subtracting a diamond-shaped dart produces positive curvature at the
outer points of the diamond, and negative curvature at the middle points
that are brought together (good for the bust or back). Conversely,
adding a diamond-shaped **gusset** produces negative curvature at its
tips and positive curvature at its middle (useful in designing stuffed
animals). Sometimes, the sharp, angular edges of the wedges are softened
to form continuous [princess seams](princess_seams "wikilink").

Since knitted fabric is generally elastic, it conforms readily to the
wearer's body without shaping. However, some shaping may be necessary
when the knitted fabrics are unusually stiff (e.g., thick cable designs
or heavily overstitched designs) or in regions of high curvature (e.g.
sock heels). Ironically, shaping is much easier and less obvious with
knitted fabrics than with woven cloth. Instead of cutting out wedges and
sewing the edges together, knitters can add or subtract stitches; work
short rows; or, most subtly of all, change the needle size to produce
smaller/larger stitches in the desired "wedge" region.

## Choosing the yarn

The choice of yarn affects the comfort of the sweater, since it affects
its warmth, weight and ability to "breathe" (air exchange). Some yarns
will also produce itching or even allergic reactions in some wearers.

The yarn affects the bulk and drape of the knitted fabric, as well as
the visibility of stitches. Complicated stitch patterns are best seen
with a smooth, highly spun yarn and may be invisible with "furry" yarns
such as mohair or novelty yarns.

The washability of yarn affects its practicability. Thus, sweaters
knitted for young children are usually knitted in acrylics, which are
light in weight and washable.

The yarn will also determine the lifetime of the sweater (in general,
highly spun yarns suffer less wear with time) and how well it will
retain its shape (elastic yarns like [wool](wool "wikilink") are better
than non-elastic yarns like [cotton](cotton "wikilink") or
[silk](silk "wikilink")).

## Choosing colors

The choice of colors is critical to the design of a sweater.

The simplest choice is to use multiple shades of a single color (e.g.,
various shades of blue), perhaps accented with a contrasting color (e.g.
flecks of yellow). The arrangement of shades on the sweater can have a
significant visual effect, due to the principle of
[chiaroscuro](chiaroscuro "wikilink"); dark shades tend to recede and be
smaller, whereas light shades advance and seem larger. For example,
vertical stripes with a light color in the middle and dark colors on the
sides have a slimming effect. Psychologically, bright colors tend to be
associated with straightforward, innocent or extroverted personalities,
whereas darker shades are associated with more thoughtful, experienced
and introverted personalities.

The ["temperature" of a color](color_theory "wikilink") also affects its
perceived depth. Warm colors have red or yellow tones (including orange
and yellow-green) and are associated psychologically with warmth and
energy. Cool colors have more bluish undertones (including purples,
aquas and greens) and are associated psychologically with serene, calm
personalities. Warm colors tend to advance relative to cool colors, when
both are presented simultaneously.

Contrasting colors may be chosen in various ways. A common choice is to
take a [complementary colors](complementary_color "wikilink") from one
of the several [color wheels](color_theory "wikilink") (e.g., blue and
orange, green and red), or to choose a pairing that occurs in nature,
e.g., yellow and red.

## Choosing shapes

The designer has many choices for how to shape the
[sleeve](sleeve "wikilink") length and cap,
[waistline](waistline_(clothing) "wikilink")/[hemline](hemline "wikilink")
and
[neckline](neckline "wikilink")/[collar](Collar_(clothing) "wikilink");
these various choices and their visual effects are described in their
individual entries. The overall shape
([silhouette](silhouette "wikilink")) of the garment is defined by the
ease introduced at various points, as described above under "Fitting".
In addition, a sweater may have ornamental lines/curves, even images. In
general, these lines are chosen to achieve a balanced look; for example,
well-chosen style lines can help compensate for body lines considered
too long or too angular or too short or too rounded. However, visual
effects may be idiosyncratic, and the knitter is encouraged to
experiment.

## Choosing an overall pattern

The scale of the overall pattern relative to the size of the whole
sweater is a key variable in the "look" of the sweater. Large overall
patterns eliminate the need for accent patterns (see next section) but
may be too bold for some wearers. A small, fine pattern makes an
excellent background for accent patterns, but may not be visible with a
particular yarn, or may be too retiring for some wearers.

## Choosing accent patterns

A sweater done uniformly in the same pattern overall is relatively
simple and understated, which may be the desired effect. However, it is
more usual to decorate the sleeve cuffs and either the neckline or the
lower hemline with an accent pattern. The accent band can be rather wide
(often \~1/3 of the total length) and its boundary can be straight or
wavy/serrated.

Smaller boundaries (such as collars, tops of pockets, central seam in
cardigan) may receive special ornamentation as well, e.g.,
[cabling](cable_knitting "wikilink") along its edges.

## Embellishments

There are many types of ornamental embellishments that can modify the
overall look of the sweater.

[Collars](Collar_(clothing) "wikilink") and
[lapels](jacket_lapel "wikilink") are perhaps the most visually obvious
embellishments. They frame the face, neck and shoulders, and complement
the [neckline](neckline "wikilink") and [armhole](armhole "wikilink")
lines.

The choice of closures is an important practical consideration and can
also help define the sweater's style. Buttons and zippers are the most
common choices for sweaters, but frogs, ties and belts are also seen.

Shoulder pads and other shaping devices are uncommon, but can be
included to define a particular silhouette.

The fabric of the sweater can be ornamented with various textures, such
as gathers, ruffles, pleats, ruching and shirring. Ornamental patterns
can be added using beads, buttons, sequins, bobbles, ribbons and knots,
as well as appliqué or cordwork. Overstitching (also known as Swiss
darning) and other embroidery techniques allow for many visual effects
that cannot be made with normal knitting, e.g., a circle of successively
interlocking stitches.
