![](Twinset.jpg "fig:Twinset.jpg") A **twinset**,[1] **twin set** or
**sweater-set** is a matching set of a
[cardigan](cardigan_(sweater) "wikilink") and a (usually) short-sleeved
[jumper or pullover](sweater "wikilink"). The twinset first appeared in
the 1940s and is now considered a classic wardrobe staple.

## Description

The classic twinset is knitted in [wool](wool "wikilink") or
[cashmere](Cashmere_wool "wikilink"), though modern interpretations can
be knit from synthetics such as acrylic. The under-sweater is usually
worn tight-fitting, with the cardigan unbuttoned to reveal accompanying
jewelry, most typically a string of pearls.

Twinsets have been associated most closely with women's work wardrobes
during the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in secretarial work or
teaching, but were occasionally viewed as too casual for more
conservative workplaces where dress suits were preferred. However, their
popularity was largely driven by Hollywood stars such as [Grace
Kelly](Grace_Kelly "wikilink"), [Marilyn
Monroe](Marilyn_Monroe "wikilink"), and [Audrey
Hepburn](Audrey_Hepburn "wikilink") who were frequently seen wearing
them on and off the set.

The twinset is often chosen by costume directors and designers in the
modern film industry to portray a character's conservatism or
frumpiness. On the other hand, interest in the twinset returned thanks
in part to the pink set worn by Elizabeth Hurley in the 1997 film
*[Austin Powers: International Man of
Mystery](Austin_Powers:_International_Man_of_Mystery "wikilink")*.

The twinset, in a variety of lengths and sleeve styles (set-in or
[raglan](Raglan_sleeve "wikilink"), short- and long-sleeved for both
cardigan and pullover), has remained commercially available to the
present day through numerous design houses, manufacturers and retailers.
Its current appeal is to older women and to "retro"-styled younger women
drawing from 1950s and 1960s-inspired influences such as the AMC drama
*[Mad Men](Mad_Men "wikilink")*.

## History

The twinset was a 1920s fashion innovation, attributed to both [Coco
Chanel](Coco_Chanel "wikilink")[2] and [Elsa
Schiaparelli](Elsa_Schiaparelli "wikilink").[3]
