## Types

### Tank top

![](Muscle_Shirt2.jpg "fig:Muscle_Shirt2.jpg") In the United States and
Canada, it is commonly known as a **tank top** and also **wifebeater**,
**guinea tee**, or **dago tee**
("[guinea](List_of_ethnic_slurs#G "wikilink")" and
"[dago](List_of_ethnic_slurs#D "wikilink")" being American [ethnic
slurs](ethnic_slurs "wikilink") for people of
[Italian](Italian_people "wikilink") ethnicity). In the UK, especially
when used as an undershirt, it is known as a **vest** (compare the
American usage of "[vest](vest "wikilink")").[1] Another term is
**singlet**, used in England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, Ghana,
Nigeria, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Indonesia, and parts of
Hawaii. In the Philippines, when used as an undershirt it is called a
**sando**. In [Bangladesh](Bangladesh "wikilink") and the State of [West
Bengal](West_Bengal "wikilink") in [India](India "wikilink"), it is
called a **sando-genji** or just **genji**; in other eastern states of
India it is called **sando-ganji** or **ganji**. In
[India](India "wikilink") it is known as a **banian** and is used
extensively as an undershirt to absorb sweat and prevent its penetration
to outer layers of clothing. In France, it is commonly called a
**marcel** after Marcel Eisenberg, who first started large-scale
production of the shirts for [Parisian](Paris "wikilink")
[porters](Material_handling "wikilink") during the mid-19th century, or
more formally a **débardeur**, meaning "docker", "porter" or
"[stevedore](stevedore "wikilink")". But in french speaking
[Belgium](Belgium "wikilink"), it is only called a **singlet**. In
[Russia](Russia "wikilink") it is used as undershirt to keep warm but
somitimes are worn without a suit during warm weather. It is generally
referred as **Mayka**

</ref>

but also known as **Alcoholichka** (Reference to alcoholism, literally
**suit of alcoholics**)

In addition to athletic usage, tank tops have traditionally been used as
undershirts, especially with suits and dress shirts. They are sometimes
worn alone without a dress shirt or top shirt during very warm and/or
humid weather, mainly in North America where the climate is warmer and
more humid in the summer. Tank tops are often worn alone under very
casual settings, as lounge wear, and/or while completing yard work or
other chores around the home.

The build of a tank top is simple: the neck and armholes are often
reinforced for durability. One usually has large armholes and neck holes
and a neckline that can reach down as far as the bottom of the chest.
(Women's tank tops have smaller holes, to conceal their
[breasts](breast "wikilink")). They are also sometimes made long to make
tucking into a pair of
[jeans](jeans "wikilink")/[shorts](shorts "wikilink") easier. In almost
all cases, they are buttonless, collarless, and pocketless. A tank top
worn as an undershirt is designed for a tight fit and is often made of
[ribbed](Ribbing_(knitting) "wikilink") [cotton](cotton "wikilink").

A tank top consists of a sleeveless shirt with low neck and different
shoulder straps width. It is named after *[tank
suits](Maillot "wikilink")*, one-piece bathing suits of the 1920s worn
in tanks or swimming pools.[2] The upper garment is worn commonly by
both men and women.

In the UK, a tank top is the local name for a *sleeveless jersey*.

### Camisole

A camisole, also called just **cami**, is a sleeveless
[undergarment](undergarment "wikilink") for women, normally extending to
the waist. They often have [spaghetti
straps](spaghetti_strap "wikilink"). Originally worn as an undershirt,
like the A-shirt they have become increasingly used as warm-weather
outerwear. The camisole is usually made of satin, nylon, or cotton.

### Dudou

A [dudou](dudou "wikilink") ("belly cover"), known as a
[yem](yếm "wikilink") in [Vietnamese](Vietnamese_clothing "wikilink")
contexts, is an item of [East Asian](Chinese_clothing "wikilink")
clothing resembling a [silk](silk "wikilink") [apron](apron "wikilink")
or [bib](bib_(garment) "wikilink") but traditionally used as an
[undershirt](undershirt "wikilink") or [bodice](bodice "wikilink") to
flatten the figure and,
[medicinally](traditional_Chinese_medicine "wikilink"), to preserve
[stomach](stomach "wikilink") *[qi](qi "wikilink")*. Beginning around
the year 2000, Western and Chinese fashion has also begun incorporating
them as a sleeveless and backless shirt for women.

### Halter top

A halter top is a sleeveless shirt in which a strap goes around the back
of the neck, leaving the upper back uncovered. Halter tops are worn
mainly by girls and women.

### Muscle shirt

A sleeveless T-shirt, also called a **muscle shirt**, is the same design
as a [T-shirt](T-shirt "wikilink"), but without sleeves. Some sleeveless
T-shirts, which possess smaller, narrower arm holes, can be worn by both
women and men, but those with larger, wider arm holes are primarily worn
by men, since the larger arm holes would expose the female
[breast](breast "wikilink") under certain circumstances. They are often
worn during athletic activities or as casual wear during warmer weather.
They are colloquially known as **shooter shirts** in the southern United
States. They were quite popular in the 1980s and were commonly
associated with surfers and [bodybuilders](Bodybuilding "wikilink")
(hence the name "muscle" shirt) and often bore the names and logos of
gyms. Such shirts without logos are now more commonly worn as casual
wear.

### Tube top

A **tube top** is a shirt with no sleeves or shoulders, essentially a
tube that wraps around a woman's torso. Some versions cover most of the
torso while others leave a large midriff. In British and Australian
English, they are informally known as **boob tubes**.[3]
