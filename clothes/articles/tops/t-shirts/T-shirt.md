of an [Atlético Nacional](Atlético_Nacional "wikilink") 1989 shirt\]\] A
**T-shirt** is a style of fabric [shirt](shirt "wikilink") named after
the T shape of its body and sleeves. Traditionally it has short sleeves
and a round neckline, known as a *[crew neck](crew_neck "wikilink")*,
which lacks a collar. T-shirts are generally made of a stretchy, light
and inexpensive fabric and are easy to clean.

Typically made of cotton textile in a [stockinette or jersey
knit](Jersey_(fabric) "wikilink"), it has a distinctively pliable
texture compared to shirts made of woven cloth. Some modern versions
have a body made from a continuously knitted tube, produced on a
[circular knitting machine](knitting_machine "wikilink"), such that the
torso has no side seams. The manufacture of T-shirts has become highly
automated and may include cutting fabric with a
[laser](Laser_cutting "wikilink") or a [water
jet](Water_jet_cutter "wikilink").

The T-shirt evolved from [undergarments](undergarment "wikilink") used
in the 19th century and, in the mid-20th century, transitioned from
undergarment to general-use casual clothing.

A V-neck T-shirt has a V-shaped [neckline](neckline "wikilink"), as
opposed to the round neckline of the more common crew neck shirt (also
called a U-neck). V-necks were introduced so that the neckline of the
shirt does not show when worn beneath an outer shirt, as would that of a
crew neck shirt.[1][2][3]

## History

![](Ww2-oiler-Arnold-R-Fesser.jpg "fig:Ww2-oiler-Arnold-R-Fesser.jpg")
sailor in 1944\]\] The T-shirt evolved from
[undergarments](undergarment "wikilink") used in the 19th century.
First, the one-piece *[union suit](union_suit "wikilink")* underwear was
cut into separate top and bottom garments, with the top long enough to
tuck under the waistband of the bottoms. With and without buttons, they
were adopted by [miners](miners "wikilink") and
[stevedores](stevedores "wikilink") during the late 19th century as a
convenient covering for hot environments.

As slip-on garments without buttons, the earliest T-shirt dates back to
sometime between the 1898 [Spanish–American
War](Spanish–American_War "wikilink") and 1913, when the U.S. Navy first
issued them as undergarments.[4] These were a crew-necked,
short-sleeved, white cotton undershirt to be worn under a
[uniform](uniform "wikilink"). It became common for sailors and Marines
in work parties, the early submarines, and tropical climates to remove
their uniform jacket, wearing (and soiling) only the undershirt.[5] They
soon became popular as a bottom layer of clothing for workers in various
industries, including agriculture. The T-shirt was easily fitted, easily
cleaned, and inexpensive, and for those reasons, it became the shirt of
choice for young boys. Boys' shirts were made in various colors and
patterns. The word *T-shirt* became part of American English by the
1920s, and appeared in the *Merriam-Webster Dictionary*.[6]

By the [Great Depression](Great_Depression "wikilink"), the T-shirt was
often the default garment to be worn when doing farm or ranch chores, as
well as other times when modesty called for a torso covering but
conditions called for lightweight fabrics.[7] Following [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink"), it was worn by Navy men as undergarments
and slowly became common to see veterans wearing their uniform trousers
with their T-shirts as casual clothing.[8]
[1](http://www.vogue.com/article/best-classic-white-t-shirts-of-all-time)
The shirts became even more popular in the 1950s after [Marlon
Brando](Marlon_Brando "wikilink") wore one in *[A Streetcar Named
Desire](A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(1951_film) "wikilink")*, finally
achieving status as fashionable, stand-alone, outerwear garments.[9]
Often boys wore them while doing chores and playing outside, eventually
opening up the idea of wearing them as general-purpose casual clothing.

Printed T-shirts were in limited use by 1942 when an Air Corps Gunnery
School T-shirt appeared on the cover of
*[Life](Life_(magazine) "wikilink")* magazine. In the 1960s, printed
T-shirts gained popularity for self-expression as well for
advertisements, protests, and souvenirs.

Current versions are available in many different designs and fabrics,
and styles include crew-neck and V-neck shirts. T-shirts are among the
most worn garments of clothing used today. T-shirts are especially
popular with branding for companies or merchandise, as they are
inexpensive to make and purchase.

## Trends

![](Frankie_Say_War!_Hide_Yourself"_t-shirt.jpg "fig:Frankie_Say_War!_Hide_Yourself"_t-shirt.jpg")
T-shirts were originally worn as undershirts, but are now worn
frequently as the only piece of [clothing](clothing "wikilink") on the
top half of the body, other than possibly a
[brassiere](brassiere "wikilink") or, rarely, a waistcoat
([vest](vest "wikilink")). T-shirts have also become a medium for
self-expression and advertising, with any imaginable combination of
words, art and photographs on display.[10]

A T-shirt typically extends to the waist. Variants of the T-shirt, such
as the V-neck, have been developed. [Hip hop
fashion](Hip_hop_fashion "wikilink") calls for *tall-T* shirts which may
extend down to the knees. A similar item is the T-shirt dress or
T-dress, a [dress-length](dress "wikilink") T-shirt that can be worn
without pants.[11] Long T-shirts are also sometimes worn by women as
nightgowns. A 1990s trend in women's clothing involved tight-fitting
*[cropped](crop_top "wikilink")* T-shirt or crop tops short enough to
reveal the [midriff](midriff "wikilink"). Another less popular trend is
wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt of a contrasting color over a
long-sleeved T-shirt, which is known as *layering*. T-shirts that are
tight to the body are called *fitted*, *tailored* or *baby doll*
T-shirts.

The rise of online shopping in the early 2000s caused a proliferation of
new T-shirt ideas and trends. While several brick-and-mortar chains
included these items in their inventories, many of these shirts were
pioneered by online start-ups. Innovations included the flip-up T-shirt,
which the wearer can lift and stretch over their head to display an
interior print, and all-over print clothing.

With the rise of social media and video sharing sites also came numerous
tutorials on DIY T-shirt projects.[12] These videos typically provided
instructions on how to modify an old shirt into a new, more fashionable
form.

### Expressive messages

![](I'm_not_a_tomboy_—_I'm_just_better_than_you.jpg "fig:I'm_not_a_tomboy_—_I'm_just_better_than_you.jpg")
T-shirt with the description *"I'm not a [tomboy](tomboy "wikilink") —
I'm just better than you."*\]\] Since the 1960s, T-shirts have
flourished as a form of personal
[expression](Emotional_expression "wikilink").[13] [Screen
printed](Screen_printed "wikilink") T-shirts have been a standard form
of [marketing](marketing "wikilink") for major American consumer
products, such as [Coca-Cola](Coca-Cola "wikilink") and [Mickey
Mouse](Mickey_Mouse "wikilink"), since the 1970s. It has also been
commonly used to commemorate an event or to make a political or personal
statement. Since the 1990s, it has become common practice for companies
of all sizes to produce T-shirts with their corporate logos or messages
as part of their overall [advertising](advertising "wikilink")
campaigns. Since the late 1980s and especially the 1990s, T-shirts with
prominent designer-name logos have become popular, especially with
teenagers and young adults. These garments allow consumers to flaunt
their taste for designer brands in an inexpensive way, in addition to
being decorative. Examples of designer T-shirt branding include [Calvin
Klein](Calvin_Klein "wikilink"), [FUBU](FUBU "wikilink"), [Ralph
Lauren](Ralph_Lauren "wikilink"), [American
Apparel](American_Apparel "wikilink"), and [The
Gap](The_Gap_(clothing_retailer) "wikilink"). These examples also
include representations of rock bands, among other obscure pop-culture
references. Licensed T-shirts are also extremely popular. Movie and TV
T-shirts can have images of the actors, logos, and funny quotations from
the movie or TV show. Often, the most popular T-shirts are those that
characters wore in the film itself (e.g., Bubba Gump from *[Forrest
Gump](Forrest_Gump "wikilink")* and Vote For Pedro from *[Napoleon
Dynamite](Napoleon_Dynamite "wikilink")*).

Designer [Katharine Hamnett](Katharine_Hamnett "wikilink"), in the early
1980s, pioneered outsize T-shirts with large-print slogans. The early
first decade of the 21st century saw the renewed popularity of T-shirts
with slogans and designs with a strong inclination to the humorous
and/or \[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/Ironymens_01.jpg
ironic\]. The trend has only increased later in this decade, embraced by
celebrities, such as [Britney Spears](Britney_Spears "wikilink") and
[Paris Hilton](Paris_Hilton "wikilink"), and reflected back on them, too
('Team Aniston'). The political and social statements that T-shirts
often display have become, since the first decade of the 21st century,
one of the reasons that they have so deeply permeated different levels
of culture and society. The statements also may be found to be
offensive, shocking, or pornographic to some. Examples of T-Shirt stores
and designers known for using offensive and shocking messages include
[T-Shirt Hell](T-Shirt_Hell "wikilink") and [Apollo
Braun](Apollo_Braun "wikilink"). Many different organizations have
caught on to the statement-making trend, including chain and independent
stores, websites, and schools.

A popular phrase on the front of demonstrating the popularity of
T-shirts among tourists is the humorous phrase "I went to _____ and
all I got was this lousy T-shirt." Examples include "My parents went to
Las Vegas and all I got was this lousy T-shirt." T-shirt exchange is an
activity where people trade the T-shirts that they are wearing.

Artists like [Bill Beckley](Bill_Beckley "wikilink"), Glen Baldridge and
[Peter Klashorst](Peter_Klashorst "wikilink") use T-shirts in their
work. Models such as [Victoria Beckham](Victoria_Beckham "wikilink") and
[Gisele Bundchen](Gisele_Bundchen "wikilink") wore T-shirts through the
2000s. Paris Fashion Week 2014 featured a grunge style T-shirt.[14]
Contemporary T-shirt designers like
[Balmain](Balmain_(fashion_house) "wikilink") and Street People Atelier
produce new styles of T-shirts.

## Decoration

wearing a decorated [Catwoman](Catwoman "wikilink") T-shirt in 2008\]\]
In the early 1950s, several companies based in [Miami,
Florida](Miami,_Florida "wikilink"), started to decorate T-shirts with
different resort names and various characters. The first company was
Tropix Togs, under founder Sam Kantor, in Miami. They were the original
licensee for Walt Disney characters in 1976 including Mickey Mouse and
Davy Crockett. Later, other companies expanded into the [T-shirt
printing](Textile_printing "wikilink") business, including Sherry
Manufacturing Company, also based in Miami. Sherry was founded in 1948
by its owner and founder Quentin H. Sandler as a screen printer of
Souvenir Scarf's to the souvenir resort market. Shortly, the company
evolved into one of the largest screen printed resort and licensed
apparel companies in the [United States](United_States "wikilink"). The
company now (2018) runs automatic Screen Print presses and produces up
to 10,000 to 20,000 T-Shirts each day.

In the 1960s, the [ringer T-shirt](ringer_T-shirt "wikilink") appeared
and became a staple fashion for youth and rock-n-rollers. The decade
also saw the emergence of [tie-dyeing](tie-dye "wikilink") and
[screen-printing](screen-printing "wikilink") on the basic T-shirt and
the T-shirt became a medium for wearable art, commercial
[advertising](advertising "wikilink"), [souvenir](souvenir "wikilink")
messages, and [protest art](protest_art "wikilink") messages.
Psychedelic art poster designer [Warren
Dayton](Warren_Dayton "wikilink") pioneered several political, protest,
and pop-culture art printed large and in color on T-shirts featuring
images of Cesar Chavez, political cartoons, and other cultural icons in
an article in the *[Los Angeles Times](Los_Angeles_Times "wikilink")*
magazine in late 1969 (ironically, the clothing company quickly
cancelled the experimental line, fearing there would not be a market).
In the late 1960s, Richard Ellman, Robert Tree, Bill Kelly, and [Stanley
Mouse](Stanley_Mouse "wikilink") set up the Monster Company in Mill
Valley, California, to produce fine art designs expressly for T-shirts.
Monster T-shirts often feature emblems and motifs associated with the
[Grateful Dead](Grateful_Dead "wikilink") and
[marijuana](marijuana "wikilink") culture.[15] Additionally, one of the
most popular symbols to emerge from the political turmoil of the 1960s
were T-shirts bearing the face of [Marxist](Marxist "wikilink")
revolutionary [Che Guevara](Che_Guevara "wikilink").[16]

Today, many notable and memorable T-shirts produced in the 1970s have
become ensconced in pop culture. Examples include the bright yellow
[happy face](Harvey_Ball "wikilink") T-shirts, [The Rolling
Stones](The_Rolling_Stones "wikilink") tops with their "tongue and
lips"[17] logo, and [Milton Glaser](Milton_Glaser "wikilink")'s iconic
"[I ♥ N Y](I_Love_New_York "wikilink")” design. In the mid-1980s, the
white T-shirt became fashionable after the actor [Don
Johnson](Don_Johnson "wikilink") wore it with an Armani suit in *[Miami
Vice](Miami_Vice "wikilink")*.[18]

### Screen printing

The most common form of commercial T-shirt decoration is [screen
printing](screen_printing "wikilink"). In screen printing, a design is
separated into individual colors. [Plastisol](Plastisol "wikilink") or
water based [inks](ink "wikilink") are applied to the shirt through mesh
screens which limits the areas where ink is deposited. In most
commercial T-shirt printing, the specific colors in the design are used.
To achieve a wider color spectrum with a limited number of colors,
process printing (using only [cyan, magenta, yellow and
black](CMYK "wikilink") ink) or simulated process (using only white,
black, red, green, blue, and gold ink) is effective. Process printing is
best suited for light colored shirts.[19] The simulated process is best
suited for dark colored shirts.

In 1959, the invention of [plastisol](plastisol "wikilink") provided an
ink more durable and stretchable than water-based ink, allowing much
more variety in T-shirt designs. Very few companies continue to use
water-based inks on their shirts. The majority of companies that create
shirts prefer plastisol due to the ability to print on varying colors
without the need for color adjustment at the art level.

Specialty inks trend in and out of fashion and include
[shimmer](Screen_printing#Screen_printing_materials "wikilink"),
[puff](Screen_printing#Screen_printing_materials "wikilink"),
[discharge](Screen_printing#Screen_printing_materials "wikilink"), and
chino based[20] inks. A metallic foil can be heat pressed and stamped
onto any plastisol ink. When combined with shimmer ink, metallics give a
mirror like effect wherever the previously screened plastisol ink was
applied. Specialty inks are more expensive to purchase as well as screen
and tend to appear on garments in boutiques.

Other methods of decoration used on T-shirts include
[airbrush](airbrush "wikilink"), [applique](applique "wikilink"),
[embroidery](embroidery "wikilink"), impressing or embossing, and the
[ironing](ironing "wikilink") on of either
[flock](Flocking_(texture) "wikilink") lettering, [heat
transfers](Iron-on#Iron-on_transfers "wikilink"), or
[dye-sublimation](dye-sublimation "wikilink") transfers. [Laser
printers](Laser_printer "wikilink") are capable of printing on plain
paper using a special [toner](toner "wikilink") containing sublimation
dyes which can then be permanently heat-transferred to T-shirts.

In the 1980s, [thermochromatic](thermochromatic "wikilink") dyes were
used to produce T-shirts that changed color when subjected to heat. The
[Global Hypercolour](Hypercolor "wikilink") brand of these was a common
sight on the streets of the [UK](United_Kingdom "wikilink") for a few
years but has since mostly disappeared. These were also very popular in
the [United States](United_States "wikilink") among teenagers in the
late 1980s. A downside of color-change garments is that the dyes can
easily be damaged, especially by [washing](laundry "wikilink") in warm
water or dye other clothes during washing.

### Tie dye

![](TieDyeShirtMpegMan.jpg "fig:TieDyeShirtMpegMan.jpg")d T-shirt\]\]
Tie dye originated in India, Japan, Jamaica, and Africa as early as the
sixth century.[21] Some forms of tie dye are
[Bandhani](Bandhani "wikilink") (the oldest known technique) used in
Indian cultures, and [Shibori](Shibori "wikilink") primarily used in
Japanese cultures. It was not until the 1960s that tie dye was
introduced to America during the [hippie
movement](hippie_movement "wikilink").[22]

### Heat transfer vinyl (HTV)

Another form of T-shirt decoration is heat transfer vinyl, also called
HTV. HTV is a polyurethane material that allows apparel designers to
create unique layered designs using a specialized software program. Once
the design is created, it is then cut through the material using a vinyl
cutter (or Cut n Press) machine.

There are dozens of different colors available, as well as glitter,
reflective, and now even unique patterns (such as mermaid skin) which
come in rolls and sheets.

After the design is cut, there is a process called “weeding” whereby the
areas of the design that do not represent the design are picked away
from the transfer sheet and removed so that the intended design remains.
HTV is typically smooth to the touch and does not feel rubbery or stiff.

The edges are typically clean cut and produce high contrast.

Designers can also create multiple color designs, or multi-layered
designs using HTV. This process would be done in the design software
before the design is sent to the cutter for the different materials A
heat press is then used to apply pressure and heat to the vinyl so that
the material permanently adheres to the garment. The temperature and
pressure vary according to the manufacturers specifications.

### Dye-sublimation printing

Dye-sublimation printing is a direct-to-garment digital printing
technology using full color artwork to transfer images to polyester and
polymer-coated substrate based T-shirts. Dye-sublimation (also commonly
referred to as all-over printing) came into widespread use in the 21st
century, enabling some designs previously impossible. Printing with
unlimited colors using large CMYK printers with special paper and ink is
possible, unlike screen printing which requires screens for each color
of the design. All-over print T-shirts have solved the problem with
color fading and the vibrancy is higher than most standard printing
methods but requires synthetic fabrics for the ink to take hold. The key
feature of dye-sublimated clothing is that the design is not printed on
top of the garment, but permanently dyed into the threads of the shirt,
ensuring that it will never fade.[23]

Dye-sublimation is economically viable for small-quantity printing; the
unit cost is similar for short or long production runs. Screen printing
has higher setup costs, requiring large numbers to be produced to be
cost-effective, and the unit cost is higher.

Solid ink [is changed into a gas](Phase_transition "wikilink") without
passing through a [liquid](liquid "wikilink") phase
([sublimation](Sublimation_(phase_transition) "wikilink")), using heat
and pressure. The design is first produced in a computer [image file
format](image_file_format "wikilink") such as jpg, gif, png, or any
other. It is printed on a purpose-made [computer
printer](computer_printer "wikilink") ( most commonly Epson or Ricoh
brands) using large heat presses to vaporize the ink directly into the
fabric. By mid-2012 this method had become widely used for T-shirts.

### Other methods

Before the hippie movement [Rit Dye](Rit_Dye "wikilink") was known as a
hobby for older women. Other methods of decorating shirts include using
paints, markers, fabric transfer crayons, dyes, spray paint, and many
more. Some techniques that can be used include sponging,
[stenciling](stenciling "wikilink"),
[daubing](wikt:daub#Verb "wikilink"),
[stamping](wikt:stamping "wikilink"), [screen
printing](screen_printing "wikilink"), bleaching, and many more.[24] As
technology advances, it offers more experimentations and possibilities
for designers and artists to seek for innovative techniques with their
T-shirts. Some new t-shirt creators have used designs with multiple
advanced techniques, which includes using glow-in-the-dark inks,
heat-sensitive fabrics, foil printing and all-over printing. Other
designers like [Robert Geller](Robert_Geller "wikilink"), a German-born
American fashion designer, has created unique t-shirt collections such
as Seconds which feature oversized graphic t-shirts made from super soft
jersey materials. [Alexander
Wang](Alexander_Wang_(designer) "wikilink"), on the other hand, came out
with variations of t-shirts from oversized scoop necks, tanks to
striped, slouchy rayon jerseys.[25] Artists like [Terence
Koh](Terence_Koh "wikilink"), took a different approach, with t-shirts
featuring an upside down portrait with a real bullet hole hand finished
by him for the Soho store Opening Ceremony.[26]
