A **gilet** () is a sleeveless jacket resembling a
[waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink") or [blouse](blouse "wikilink").[1] It
may be waist- to knee-length and is typically straight-sided rather than
fitted; however, historically, gilets were fitted and embroidered.[2] In
19th-century dressmaking a gilet was a dress bodice shaped like a man's
waistcoat.[3]

Today, gilets are often worn as an outer layer, for extra warmth
outdoors, or indoors on occasion. Fashion gilets may be made of cloth or
fake fur, or knitted. Sports gilets are often windproof and/or made of
[fleece](Wool "wikilink"). High-end [hiking](hiking "wikilink") jackets
often have an integral gilet inside them, that can be zipped on and off.
[Racing cyclists](Racing_cyclist "wikilink") use thin light gilets with
a windproof front and mesh back. Shooting gilets are rugged and made of
leather. Short, overwear gilets are called *bodywarmers* in the United
Kingdom.
