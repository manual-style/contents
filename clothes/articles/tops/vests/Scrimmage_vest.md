A **scrimmage vest**, sometimes referred to as a
**[pinnie](Pinafore "wikilink")**, is a piece of
[clothing](clothing "wikilink") or [sportswear](clothing "wikilink"),
often made of mesh, used in practices as a substitute for a sports
team's usual uniform or to differentiate temporary teams in informal
scrimmages. Some teams elect to have benched players wear them during a
game. A vest can come in a variety of forms, including a racerback
cut,[1] collegiate cut, [basketball](basketball "wikilink") cut or
[lacrosse](lacrosse "wikilink") pinnie.

Vests are usually made from poly-mesh material. [Screen
printing](Screen_printing "wikilink") or vinyl heat press artwork is
often applied directly to the mesh. New techniques include
[dye-sublimation](Dye-sublimation_printer "wikilink").
