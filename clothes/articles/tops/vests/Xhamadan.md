![](Xhamadani.jpg "fig:Xhamadani.jpg"), an Albanian freedom fighter of
early 20th century\]\] A **xhamadan** or **xhamadani** is a traditional
wool garment, which is worn by [Albanian](Albanians "wikilink") men.[1]
It can be sleeved or sleeveless. The sleeveless xhamadan is only one
type of the Albanian vest, the other two being the *xhamadani me
reshme*, and the *xhamadani fermele*.[2] The xhamadani me reshme went
out of use around the beginning of the 20th century.[3] whereas the
xhamadan and the xhamadani fermele continue to be used in traditional
festivities. A good xhamadan is usually richly embroidered, sometimes in
gold: in the past its quality revealed social rank.[4]

## History

The xhamadani originated in the northeastern parts of Albania, but is
worn throughout the country and in other territories inhabited by
Albanians.[5] The xhamadan appears to be the jacket to which
16th-century English poet [Edmund Spenser](Edmund_Spenser "wikilink")
refers in a line of his *[Faerie Queene](The_Faerie_Queene "wikilink")*,
published in the 1590s, where he mentions the *sleeves-dependent,
Albanese wise*.[6] It is mentioned several times by British travel
writers, such as [John Foster Fraser](John_Foster_Fraser "wikilink"),
who in the first (1906) edition of his book, *Pictures from the
Balkans*, observes the preferences of Albanian men for xhamadans
embroidered in gold or silver.[7]

## Types of xhamadan

![](Valltare_te_Kukesit.JPG "fig:Valltare_te_Kukesit.JPG") wearing
xhamadan\]\] There were three types of xhamadanis in Albania: the
xhamadan, the *xhamadani me reshme* and the *xhamadani fermele*, of
which only the fermele and xhamadan are still in use, the jermele having
fallen out of favour around the beginning of the 20th century.[8]

The xhamadan usually can be closed on the left side, it has usually two
pockets, an outside and an inside one, and is adorned with embroidery.
In winter time the Albanians would wear the
*[tallagan](tallagan "wikilink")*, a heavy coat, on top of the
xhamadan.[9] The embroidery can be in silk or cotton braids.[10]

Northern and southern Albanians each had several types of xhamadan,
which differed in color and cut. Northern Albanians would usually wear a
xhamadan of red velvet, embroidered in black silk or, sometimes,
gold.[11] The quality of the embroidery itself indicates social
rank.[12] In particular, the xhamadan worn by Albanians in the region of
[Tetovo](Tetovo "wikilink") (now [North
Macedonia](North_Macedonia "wikilink")), is white, or creamy, and richly
embroidered. It is sleeveless, and open on the chest, but it can be
closed, with special fastenings. It has been a tradition that the
bridegroom would wear it on his wedding day.[13]

The southern Albanian version of the xhamadan for men is no longer red
like the northern one, but creamy or dark blue.[14]

The northern Albanian xhamadan would usually have one pocket for the
[pocketwatch](pocketwatch "wikilink"), or two, if the watch had a chain.
In southern Albania the chain would be worn diagonally, instead.[15]

## Trivia

The song "[Xhamadani vija vija](Xhamadani_vija_vija "wikilink")" (),
composed in 1993 by [Zef Çoba](Zef_Çoba "wikilink"), refers to the
xhamadan, and envisions the [union of Albania and
Kosovo](Kosovo's_unification_with_Albania "wikilink"), united under a
common vest.[16]
