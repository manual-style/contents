![](Jelick.jpg "fig:Jelick.jpg") A **yelek** (in
[Turkish](Turkish_language "wikilink"); spelled *jelek* in
[Serbo-Croatian](Serbo-Croatian "wikilink") and
[Albanian](Albanian_language "wikilink"); also spelled *jelick* in older
English texts) is the [bodice](bodice "wikilink") or
[waistcoat](waistcoat "wikilink") of an
[Ottoman](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") female dress(also for men). The
*yelek* is typically a sleeveless and collarless garment and usually has
small pockets on the sides. Traditional yeleks are generally embroidered
and made out of silk cloth as well as velvet and leather. During the
Ottoman era, the yelek was a hip-length jacket or vest worn for warmth
by both sexes. It could have long sleeves, short sleeves, or no sleeves,
and often had a small standing collar. A shorter variant, the *anteri*
(or "anteree", *anterija*) was also popular.

In present-day Turkish, *yelek* is also the common word for a modern,
usually sleeveless or short-sleeved vest, both for women and for men.
