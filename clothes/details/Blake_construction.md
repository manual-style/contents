**Blake construction** is a method of making [shoes](shoes "wikilink")
invented in 1856 by Lyman Reed Blake.[1]

It is especially popular in [Italy](Made_in_Italy "wikilink").[2] In a
Blake construction, the outer sole is directly stitched to the
[insole](insole "wikilink"); this allows more flexibility and lighter
weight as compared to the sturdier [Goodyear
construction](Goodyear_construction "wikilink").
