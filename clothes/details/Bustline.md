[thumb\|200px\|left\|[Nightie](Nightie "wikilink") with loose
bustline](/File:Lace_nightie.jpg "wikilink") A **bustline** is an
arbitrary line encircling the fullest part of the
[bust](/Breast "wikilink") or body circumference at the bust.[1] It is a
[body measurement](/body_measurement "wikilink") which measures the
[circumference](/circumference "wikilink") of a woman's
[torso](/torso "wikilink") at the level of the
[breasts](/breasts "wikilink"). It is measured by keeping a [measuring
tape](/measuring_tape "wikilink") horizontal and wrapping it around the
body so that it goes over the [nipples](/nipple "wikilink") and under
the [arms](/arm "wikilink").

In relation to a woman's [garment](/garment "wikilink"), the bustline is
the outline or shape of a woman's bust, or the part of the garment which
covers the breasts, such as a dress with a fitted bustline.[2] The
bustline is an important measure in women's [clothing
sizes](/clothing_size "wikilink").

## Other measures

A **full bust** is another term for the bustline measure but is also
commonly used to refer to a breast with a [cup
size](/Brassiere_measurement#Cup_measurement_methods "wikilink") of at
least C.

A **high bust** is a measure of a woman's torso above her breasts.

An **under-bust** is the measure below the breasts.

These measures are usually taken when taking measurements for the
bustline of a woman's [garment](/garment "wikilink"), especially if the
garment is to be [form-fitting](/form-fitting "wikilink") at the bust.
