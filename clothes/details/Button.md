In modern [clothing](/clothing "wikilink") and [fashion
design](/fashion_design "wikilink"), a **button** is a small
[fastener](/fastener "wikilink"), now most commonly made of
[plastic](/plastic "wikilink") but also may be made of metal, wood, or
[seashell](/seashell "wikilink"), that joins two pieces of
[fabric](/fabric "wikilink") together. In
[archaeology](/archaeology "wikilink"), a button can be a significant
[artifact](/Artifact_(archaeology) "wikilink"). In the [applied
arts](/applied_art "wikilink") and in [craft](/crafts "wikilink"), a
button can be an example of [folk art](/folk_art "wikilink"), [studio
craft](/studio_craft "wikilink"), or even a miniature [work of
art](/art_object "wikilink").

Buttons are most often attached to articles of
[clothing](/clothing "wikilink") but can also be used on containers such
as [wallets](/wallets "wikilink") and bags. However, buttons may be sewn
onto garments and similar items exclusively for purposes of
[ornamentation](/fashion "wikilink"). Buttons serving as
[fasteners](/fasteners "wikilink") work by slipping through a fabric or
thread loop or by sliding through a
[buttonhole](/buttonhole "wikilink"). Other types of fastenings include
[zippers](/zipper "wikilink"),
[Velcro](/Hook_and_loop_fastener "wikilink"), and
[magnets](/magnet "wikilink").

## History

[thumb\|right\|230px\|Spanish button from ca. 1650-1675 (about 12
mm).](/File:Spanish_button_ca._1650-75_12mm_f&b.jpg "wikilink") Buttons
and button-like objects used as ornaments or
[seals](/Seal_(device) "wikilink") rather than fasteners have been
discovered in the [Indus Valley
Civilization](/Indus_Valley_Civilization "wikilink") during its [Kot
Diji](/Kot_Diji "wikilink") phase (c. 2800–2600 BC)[1] as well as
[Bronze Age](/Bronze_Age "wikilink") sites in
[China](/History_of_China "wikilink") (c. 2000–1500 BC) and [Ancient
Rome](/Ancient_Rome "wikilink").

Buttons made from [seashell](/seashell "wikilink") were used in the
Indus Valley Civilization for ornamental purposes by 2000 BC.[2] Some
buttons were carved into [geometric shapes](/geometric_shape "wikilink")
and had holes pierced into them so that they could be attached to
clothing with thread.[3] Ian McNeil (1990) holds that "the button, in
fact, was originally used more as an ornament than as a fastening, the
earliest known being found at [Mohenjo-daro](/Mohenjo-daro "wikilink")
in the [Indus Valley](/Indus_Valley "wikilink"). It is made of a curved
shell and about 5000 years old."[4]

Functional buttons with buttonholes for fastening or closing clothes
appeared first in [Germany](/Germany "wikilink") in the 13th century.[5]
They soon became widespread with the rise of snug-fitting garments in
13th- and 14th-century [Europe](/Europe "wikilink").

### As containers

Since at least the seventeenth century, when box-like metal buttons were
constructed especially for the purpose,[6] buttons have been one of the
items in which [drug](/drug "wikilink")
[smugglers](/smugglers "wikilink") have attempted to hide and transport
illegal substances. At least one modern smuggler has tried to use this
method.[7]

Also making use of the storage possibilities of metal buttons, during
the [World Wars](/World_Wars "wikilink"),
[British](/United_Kingdom "wikilink") and [U.S.
military](/U.S._military "wikilink") [locket](/locket "wikilink")
buttons were made, containing miniature working
[compasses](/compass "wikilink").[8]

## Materials and manufacture

[right\|thumb\|Button stamping machine,
Henri Jamorski Button Factory,
Paris, France,
1919](/File:Button_stamping_machine,_Henri_Jamorski_Button_Factory,_Paris,_France,_1919_(28206559760).jpg "wikilink")

Because buttons have been manufactured from almost every possible
material, both [natural](/Natural_materials "wikilink") and
[synthetic](/Synthetic_chemical "wikilink"), and combinations of both,
the history of the material composition of buttons reflects the
[timeline of materials
technology](/timeline_of_materials_technology "wikilink").

Buttons can be individually crafted by [artisans](/artisans "wikilink"),
[craftspeople](/craftspeople "wikilink") or
[artists](/artists "wikilink") from [raw
materials](/raw_materials "wikilink") or [found
objects](/found_objects "wikilink") (for example
[fossils](/fossils "wikilink")), or a combination of both.
Alternatively, they can be the product of
[low-tech](/low-tech "wikilink") [cottage
industry](/cottage_industry "wikilink") or can be
[mass-produced](/Mass-production "wikilink") in
[high-tech](/High-tech#High-tech_industries "wikilink")
[factories](/factories "wikilink"). Buttons made by artists are [art
objects](/art_object "wikilink"), known to button collectors as "studio
buttons" (or simply "studios", from [studio
craft](/studio_craft "wikilink")).[9]

In 1918, the US government made an extensive survey of the international
button market, which listed buttons made of [vegetable
ivory](/vegetable_ivory "wikilink"), [metal](/metal "wikilink"),
[glass](/glass "wikilink"), [galalith](/galalith "wikilink"),
[silk](/silk "wikilink"), [linen](/linen "wikilink"), cotton-covered
[crochet](/crochet "wikilink"), [lead](/lead "wikilink"), [snap
fasteners](/snap_fastener "wikilink"),
[enamel](/Vitreous_enamel "wikilink"), [rubber](/rubber "wikilink"),
[buckhorn](/antler "wikilink"), [wood](/wood "wikilink"),
[horn](/horn_(anatomy) "wikilink"), [bone](/bone "wikilink"),
[leather](/leather "wikilink"), [paper](/paper "wikilink"), pressed
[cardboard](/cardboard "wikilink"),
[mother-of-pearl](/nacre "wikilink"),
[celluloid](/celluloid "wikilink"), [porcelain](/porcelain "wikilink"),
[composition](/composition_doll "wikilink"), [tin](/tin "wikilink"),
[zinc](/zinc "wikilink"), [xylonite](/celluloid "wikilink"),
[stone](/stone "wikilink"), cloth-covered wooden forms, and
[papier-mâché](/papier-mâché "wikilink"). Vegetable ivory was said to be
the most popular for suits and shirts, and papier-mâché far and away the
commonest sort of shoe button.[10]

Nowadays, hard plastic, seashell, metals, and [wood](/wood "wikilink")
are the most common materials used in button-making; the others tending
to be used only in premium or [antique](/antique "wikilink") apparel, or
found in [collections](/Button_collecting "wikilink").

Over 60% of the world's button supply comes from [Qiaotou, Yongjia
County](/Qiaotou,_Yongjia_County "wikilink"),
[China](/China "wikilink").[11][12]

### Decoration and coating techniques

Historically, fashions in buttons have also reflected trends in [applied
aesthetics](/Applied_aesthetics#Two-dimensional_and_plastic_arts "wikilink")
and the [applied](/Applied_arts "wikilink") [visual
arts](/visual_arts "wikilink"), with buttonmakers using techniques from
[jewellery making](/jewellery_making "wikilink"),
[ceramics](/ceramic_art "wikilink"), [sculpture](/sculpture "wikilink"),
[painting](/painting "wikilink"),
[printmaking](/printmaking "wikilink"),
[metalworking](/metalworking "wikilink"), [weaving](/weaving "wikilink")
and others. The following are just a few of the construction and
decoration techniques that have been used in button-making:

### Styles of attachment

[thumb\|right\|Three plastic sew-through buttons (left) and one shank,
fabric-covered button
(right)](/File:Plastic_&_fabric_buttons_showing_holes_&_shank.jpg "wikilink")
[thumb\|Different examples of shirt
studs](/File:ShirtStuds.jpg "wikilink") [thumb\|Plastic studs for
bedclothes](/File:Durchsteckknoepfe.jpg "wikilink")

-   **[Shank](/Shank_(sewing) "wikilink")** buttons have a hollow
    protrusion on the back through which thread is sewn to attach the
    button.[13] Button shanks may be made from a separate piece of the
    same or a different substance as the button itself, and added to the
    back of the button, or be carved or moulded directly onto the back
    of the button, in which latter case the button is referred to by
    collectors as having a 'self-shank'.
-   **Flat or sew-through** buttons have holes through which thread is
    sewn to attach the button.[14] Flat buttons may be attached by
    [sewing machine](/sewing_machine "wikilink") rather than by hand,
    and may be used with heavy fabrics by working a thread shank to
    extend the height of the button above the fabric.
-   **Stud** buttons (also push-through buttons or just studs) are
    composed from an actual button, connected to a second, button-like
    element by a narrow metal or plastic bar. Pushed through two
    opposing holes within what is meant to be kept together, the actual
    button and its counterpart press it together, keeping it joined.
    Popular examples of such buttons are shirt studs and
    [cufflinks](/cufflink "wikilink").
-   **[Snap fasteners](/Snap_fasteners "wikilink")** (also pressure
    buttons or press studs) are metal (usually brass) round discs
    pinched through the fabric. They are often found on clothing, in
    particular on denim pieces such as pants and jackets. They are more
    securely fastened to the material. As they rely on a metal rivet
    attached securely to the fabric, pressure buttons are difficult to
    remove without compromising the fabric's integrity. They are made of
    two couples: the male stud couple and the female stud couple. Each
    couple has one front (or top) and rear (or bottom) side (the fabric
    goes in the middle).

### Fabric buttons

-   **Covered buttons** are fabric-covered forms with a separate back
    piece that secures the fabric over the knob.
-   **Mandarin buttons** or [frogs](/Frog_(fastening) "wikilink") are
    knobs made of intricately knotted strings. Mandarin buttons are a
    key element in [Mandarin dress](/Mandarin_dress "wikilink") (*[Qi
    Pao](/qipao "wikilink")* and *[cheongsam](/cheongsam "wikilink")* in
    [Chinese](/Chinese_language "wikilink")), where they are closed with
    loops. Pairs of mandarin buttons worn as [cuff
    links](/cuff_link "wikilink") are called **silk knots**.
-   **Worked or cloth buttons** are created by
    [embroidering](/embroidery "wikilink") or
    [crocheting](/crochet "wikilink") tight stitches (usually with
    [linen](/linen "wikilink") [thread](/yarn "wikilink")) over a knob
    or ring called a **form**. [Dorset
    buttons](/Dorset_button "wikilink"), handmade from the 17th century
    to 1750, are of this type.

### Button sizes

The size of the button depends on its use. Shirt buttons are generally
small, and spaced close together, whereas coat buttons are larger and
spaced further apart. Buttons are commonly measured in
[lignes](/ligne "wikilink") (also called
*[lines](/Line_(unit) "wikilink")* and abbreviated *L*), with 40 lignes
equal to 1 inch. For example, some standard sizes of buttons are 16
lignes (10.16 mm, standard button of men's [shirts](/shirt "wikilink"))
and 32 lignes (20.32 mm, typical button on [suit
jackets](/suit_(clothes) "wikilink")).

The [American](/United_States "wikilink") National Button Society
(NBS)[15] has its own button sizing system which divides button sizes
into 'small', 'medium' and 'large'.

## In museums and galleries

[thumb\|right\|230px\|Peter Carl Fabergé buttons in the Cleveland Museum
of
Art](/File:Peter_Carl_Fabergé_-_Buttons_-_1966.490_-_Cleveland_Museum_of_Art.jpg "wikilink")
Some [museums](/museums "wikilink") and [art
galleries](/art_galleries "wikilink") hold culturally, historically,
politically, and/or artistically significant buttons in their
collections. The [Victoria & Albert
Museum](/Victoria_and_Albert_Museum "wikilink") has many buttons,[16]
particularly in its [jewellery
collection](/Victoria_and_Albert_Museum#Jewellery "wikilink"), as does
the [Smithsonian Institution](/Smithsonian "wikilink").[17][18][19][20]

Hammond Turner & Sons, a button-making company in
[Birmingham](/Birmingham "wikilink"), hosts an online museum with an
image gallery and historical button-related articles,[21] including an
1852 article on button-making by [Charles
Dickens](/Charles_Dickens "wikilink").[22] In the US, large button
collections are on public display at the Waterbury Button Museum of
[Waterbury, Connecticut](/Waterbury,_Connecticut "wikilink"),[23] the
Keep Homestead Museum of [Monson,
Massachusetts](/Monson,_Massachusetts "wikilink"),[24] which also hosts
an extensive button archive,[25] and in Gurnee, Illinois at The Button
Room.[26]

## Gallery

## In politics

[thumb\|right\|upright\|Stud buttons of Gen. [Gregorio del
Pilar](Gregorio_del_Pilar "wikilink"), Marcelo Museum,
[Philippines](/Philippines "wikilink")](/File:Bulacanmuseumjf12.JPG "wikilink")

The mainly American tradition of politically significant clothing
buttons appears to have begun with the [first presidential
inauguration](/First_inauguration_of_George_Washington "wikilink") of
[George Washington](/George_Washington "wikilink") in 1789. Known to
collectors as "Washington Inaugurals",[27] they were made of
[copper](/copper "wikilink"), [brass](/brass "wikilink") or [Sheffield
plate](/Sheffield_plate "wikilink"), in large sizes for coats and
smaller sizes for breeches.[28] Made in twenty-two patterns and
hand-stamped, they are now extremely valuable [cultural
artifacts](/cultural_artifact "wikilink").

Between about 1840 and 1916, clothing buttons were used in American
[political campaigns](/political_campaign "wikilink"), and still exist
in collections today. Initially, these buttons were predominantly made
of brass (though horn and rubber buttons with stamped or moulded designs
also exist) and had loop shanks. Around 1860 the badge or
[pin-back](/Pin-back_button "wikilink") style of construction, which
replaced the shanks with long pins, probably for use on lapels and ties,
began to appear.[29]

One common practice that survived until recent times on campaign buttons
and badges was to include the image of [George
Washington](/George_Washington "wikilink") with that of the candidate in
question.

Some of the most famous [campaign buttons](/campaign_button "wikilink")
are those made for [Abraham Lincoln](/Abraham_Lincoln "wikilink").
[Memorial](/Memorial "wikilink") buttons commemorating Lincoln's
inaugurations and other life events, including his birth and
[death](/Abraham_Lincoln#Assassination "wikilink"), were also made, and
are also considered highly collectible.[30]

## Phobia

Koumpounophobia, the fear of buttons, is a surprisingly common phobia.
Sufferers frequently report being repulsed by the sight of buttons, even
on other people, and being unable to wear clothing with them. Sufferers
also report buttons being dirty and smelling.[31][32] The phobia may
bear some passing resemblance to [trypophobia](/trypophobia "wikilink")
and [obsessive–compulsive
disorder](/obsessive–compulsive_disorder "wikilink"), but is separate
and distinct.
