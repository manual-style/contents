Cleavage}}

**Cleavage** is the exposed area between a woman's
[breasts](breasts "wikilink") lying over the
[sternum](Human_sternum "wikilink"), and refers *only* to what is
visible with clothing (or dense, nontransparent [body
art](body_art "wikilink")) that includes a low-cut
[neckline](neckline "wikilink").[1] In some cultures, display of
cleavage is considered aesthetic or erotic, and may be associated with
garments with low necklines that expose or highlight cleavage, such as
[ball gowns](ball_gown "wikilink"), [evening
gowns](evening_gown "wikilink"), lingerie, and
[swimwear](swimwear "wikilink"). In these cultures women have,
throughout history, sought to enhance their [physical
attractiveness](physical_attractiveness "wikilink") and femininity,
within the context of changing fashions and cultural-specific
[norms](Norm_(social) "wikilink") of [modesty](modesty "wikilink") of
the time and place. The methods practised in appropriate contexts have
included the accentuation and partial display of breasts, including
cleavage. In some cultures any display of cleavage may be culturally
[taboo](taboo "wikilink") (e.g. *juyub* in Islam), illegal or otherwise
socially disapproved of.

## Terminology

The [anatomical term](Anatomical_terminology "wikilink") for the area
that constitutes a cleavage is [intermammary
cleft](intermammary_cleft "wikilink"), intermammary sulcus or sulcus
intermammarius.

[Décolletage](Décolletage "wikilink") is the upper part of a woman's
torso, between her waist and neck, comprising her neck, shoulders, back
and chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. However, the
term is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes
cleavage.[2]

When the side of the breasts are uncovered, it is known as "side
cleavage" (a dubious construction, since cleavage is not involved since
the intermammary cleft is not what is shown), "sidewinders" or
"sideboob".[3][4] In early 2010s side cleavage was identified as a
fashion trend. Gabriele Hackworthy, fashion director at *[Harper's
Bazaar](Harper's_Bazaar "wikilink")*, said, "The look is unlikely to
fade fast, with [Yves Saint
Laurent](Yves_Saint_Laurent_(brand) "wikilink") and [Roberto
Cavalli](Roberto_Cavalli "wikilink") both pushing the silhouette next
season."[5][6]

When the lower part of the breasts is uncovered, it is called
"underboob".[7][8]

## Culture

### Western culture

modern [gown](gown "wikilink") reflecting the current [fashion
trend](fashion_trend "wikilink") at a [Haute
couture](Haute_couture "wikilink") fashion show.\]\]

Many people in [Western culture](Western_culture "wikilink"), both male
and female, consider breasts an important female [secondary sex
characteristic](secondary_sex_characteristic "wikilink")[9] and an
important aspect of femininity. [Décolletage](Décolletage "wikilink")
that exposes cleavage is used by many women to enhance their
[physical](physical_attractiveness "wikilink") and [sexual
attractiveness](sexual_attractiveness "wikilink") and to improve their
sense of femininity. Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often
regarded as a form of feminine [flirting](flirting "wikilink") or
[seduction](seduction "wikilink"), as much as for its aesthetic or
erotic effect. Most men derive [erotic
pleasure](erotic_pleasure "wikilink") from seeing a woman's
cleavage,[10] and some people derive pleasure in their female partner
exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or
exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention.[11] During adolescence,
some girls become fixated on breast shape and cleavage.[12] The use of
tight clothing and the display of cleavage have been attributed as
causes of an increase in [breast
fetishism](breast_fetishism "wikilink"), and atypical
[paraphilia](paraphilia "wikilink").[13]

In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as
to how much cleavage exposure is acceptable in public.[14] In
contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose her
breasts depends on social and cultural context. Displaying cleavage or
any part of female breast may be considered inappropriate or even
prohibited by [dress codes](dress_code "wikilink") in some settings,
such as workplaces, churches, and schools, while in some spaces showing
as much cleavage as possible can be permissible or even encouraged. The
exposure of [nipples](nipple "wikilink") or
[areolae](areolae "wikilink") is almost always considered immodest and
in some instances is viewed as [lewd](lewd "wikilink") or
[indecent](indecent_exposure "wikilink") behavior.[15] Art historian
[James Laver](James_Laver "wikilink") argued that the changing standards
of revealing cleavage is more prominent in evening wear than in day wear
in the Western world.[16]

### Modesty considerations

There is historical evidence that some cultures strongly discouraged
cleavage or any hint of a bosom.[17] [Early English
Puritans](History_of_the_Puritans_under_James_I "wikilink") used a tight
bodice to flatten breasts completely, while 17th century
[Spaniards](Spaniard "wikilink") put lead plates across the chests of
young girls to prevent their bosoms from developing.[18]

In the [Quran](Quran "wikilink"), the holy book of
[Islam](Islam "wikilink"), it is stated, "Let them draw their
[Khimar](Khimar "wikilink") (shawl/head veil) over their *juyub*
(breast-line/cleavage)".[19] The *ayat* refers to the women's clothes
worn, parted in the front to expose the breasts, at the time when it was
cited.[20][21][22][23] It was later interpreted as total covering of a
woman's body.[24][25][26] In early 21st century [Muslim
world](Muslim_world "wikilink") there are differences in legal
implementation. In [Saudi Arabia](Saudi_Arabia "wikilink") and
[Afghanistan](Afghanistan "wikilink"), women are required to cover their
body and face completely,[27] [Iranian](Iran "wikilink") law requires a
[chador](chador "wikilink") (over-cloak) or a [hijab](hijab "wikilink")
(head scarf).[28] In [Egypt](Egypt "wikilink"), the exposure of cleavage
in the media is considered to be nudity.[29]

### Theories

The cleavage area between the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and
stimulation of interest. Breast and [buttock
cleavages](buttock_cleavage "wikilink"), sharing a similarity between
their appearances, are considered sexual in some cultures.[30] British
[zoologist](zoologist "wikilink") and
[ethologist](ethologist "wikilink") [Desmond
Morris](Desmond_Morris "wikilink") theorizes that cleavage is a sexual
signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks.[31]
Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species.
Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture
reduces visibility of the buttocks, but the breasts are significantly
enlarged. Theorists hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes,
the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females has
shifted from swagging buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and
cleavage.[32]

[Evolutionary psychologists](Evolutionary_psychology "wikilink")
theorize that humans' permanently enlarged breasts, in contrast to other
primates' breasts, which only enlarge during
[ovulation](ovulation "wikilink"), allowed females to "solicit male
attention and investment even when they are not really fertile",[33]
though Morris notes that in recent years there has been a trend toward
reversing breast augmentations.[34][35] According to social historian
David Kunzle, waist confinement and décolletage are the primary
[sexualization](sexualization "wikilink") devices of Western
costume.[36] By the turn of the 21st century, some of the attention
given to cleavage and breasts started to shift to buttocks, especially
in the media.[37]

## Western history

### Antiquity

In 2600 BCE, princess [Nofret](Nofret "wikilink") of the [Fourth Dynasty
of Egypt](Fourth_Dynasty_of_Egypt "wikilink") was depicted in a V-neck
gown with a plunging neckline that exposed ample cleavage. In 1600 BCE,
[Snake Goddess](Snake_Goddess "wikilink") figurines were sculpted in
[Minos](Minos "wikilink") with open dress-fronts, revealing entire
breasts.[38] Ancient Greek goddess [Hera](Hera "wikilink") wore an early
version of a push-up bra, described in the *[Iliad](Iliad "wikilink")*
as festooned with "brooches of gold" and "a hundred tassels", to
increase her cleavage to divert [Zeus](Zeus "wikilink") from the [Trojan
War](Trojan_War "wikilink").[39]

### Middle Ages

Décolletage was often a feature of the dress of the late Middle Ages.
This continued through the [Victorian
period](Victorian_period "wikilink"). Gowns that exposed a woman's neck
and top of her chest were very common and uncontroversial in Europe from
at least the 11th century until the Victorian period in the 19th
century. Ball or evening gowns especially featured low square
décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage.[40][41]

In the 14th century, necklines were lowered, clothes were tightened and
breasts were once again flaunted. In 1450, [Agnès
Sorel](Agnès_Sorel "wikilink"), mistress to [Charles VII of
France](Charles_VII_of_France "wikilink"), is credited with starting a
fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with [fully bared
breasts](toplessness "wikilink") in the French court.[42] Other
aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed
included [Simonetta Vespucci](Simonetta_Vespucci "wikilink"), whose
[portrait with exposed
breasts](Portrait_of_Simonetta_Vespucci_(Piero_di_Cosimo) "wikilink")
was painted by [Piero di Cosimo](Piero_di_Cosimo "wikilink") in c.1480.

### Early modern period

first wife of [James II of England](James_II_of_England "wikilink") by
Sir [Peter Lely](Peter_Lely "wikilink"), about 1665\]\]

In many European societies between the Renaissance and the 19th century,
wearing low-cut dresses that exposed breasts was more acceptable than
today; with a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders being considered
to be more risqué than exposed breasts.[43][44][45] In
[aristocratic](aristocracy_(class) "wikilink") and upper-class circles
the display of breasts was at times regarded as a [status
symbol](status_symbol "wikilink"), as a sign of beauty, wealth or social
position.[46] The bared breast even invoked associations with nude
sculptures of [classical Greece](Ancient_Greece "wikilink") that were
exerting an influence on art, sculpture, and architecture of the
period.[47] After the [French Revolution](French_Revolution "wikilink")
décolletage become larger in the front and less in the back.[48]

During the 16th century, women's fashions with exposed breasts were
common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and emulated by
all classes. [Anne of Brittany](Anne_of_Brittany "wikilink") has also
been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square
décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even
[Queen Mary II](Mary_II_of_England "wikilink") and [Henrietta
Maria](Henrietta_Maria_of_France "wikilink"), wife of [Charles I of
England](Charles_I_of_England "wikilink"), were depicted with fully
bared breasts; and architect [Inigo Jones](Inigo_Jones "wikilink")
designed a [masque](masque "wikilink") costume for Henrietta Maria that
fully revealed both of her breasts.[49][50] During the [fashions of the
period 1795–1820](1795–1820_in_fashion "wikilink"), many women wore
dresses that bared necks, bosoms and shoulders. [Anne of
Austria](Anne_of_Austria "wikilink") was known for wearing, along with
female members of her court, very tight [bodice](bodice "wikilink") and
[corsets](corset "wikilink") that forced breasts together to make deeper
cleavages, very low necklines that exposed breasts visible almost in
entirety above the [areola](areola "wikilink") and pendants lying on the
cleavage to highlight it.[51]

### Modern period

![](Sargent_MadameX.jpeg "fig:Sargent_MadameX.jpeg") of [Virginie Amélie
Avegno Gautreau](Virginie_Amélie_Avegno_Gautreau "wikilink") depicting
her cleavage caused considerable controversy when it was displayed at
the 1884 [Salon](Salon_(Paris) "wikilink") art exhibition in Paris.\]\]

During the [Victorian](Victorian_morality "wikilink") period, social
attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public. For ordinary
wear, high collars were the norm. Towards the end of the Victorian
period (end 19th century) the full collar was the fashion, though some
décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions (see [1880s in
fashion](1880s_in_fashion "wikilink")).

During the French [Enlightenment](Age_of_Enlightenment "wikilink"),
there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual
enticement or rather a natural gift to be offered from mother to child.
In [Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de
Moissy](Alexandre_Guillaume_Mouslier_de_Moissy "wikilink")'s 1771 play
*The True Mother* (*La Vraie Mère*), the title character rebukes her
husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual
gratification: "Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts –
the respectable treasures of nature – as merely an embellishment,
destined to ornament the chest of women?"[52] Nearly a century later,
also in France, a man from the provinces who attended a Court ball at
the [Tuileries](Tuileries "wikilink") in Paris in 1855 was deeply
shocked by the décolleté dresses and is said to have exclaimed in
disgust: "I haven't seen anything like that since I was weaned!"[53]

In 1884 *[Portrait of Madame X](Portrait_of_Madame_X "wikilink")*, a
portrait painting by [John Singer
Sargent](John_Singer_Sargent "wikilink") of American-born Paris
socialite, [Virginie Amélie Avegno
Gautreau](Virginie_Amélie_Avegno_Gautreau "wikilink"), was
criticized[54] for depicting her in a sleek black dress displaying what
was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen
off her shoulder. The controversy was so great that he reworked the
painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder,
and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884.[55][56] In 1908, a single pad
made of rubber or a "bust form" was advertised that was to be worn
inside the front of the bodice to make cleavage virtually
undetectable.[57]

Clergymen all over the world became shocked when dresses to be worn with
modest round or V-shaped necklines became fashionable around 1913. In
the [German Empire](German_Empire "wikilink"), for example, all [Roman
Catholic](Roman_Catholic "wikilink") bishops joined in issuing a
pastoral letter attacking the new fashions.[58] Fashions became more
restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became
more accepted in Western societies during [World War
I](World_War_I "wikilink") and remained so for nearly half a
century.[59]

### 20th century

In 1953, Hollywood film *[The French Line](The_French_Line "wikilink")*
was found objectionable under the [Hays Code](Hays_Code "wikilink")
because of [Jane Russell](Jane_Russell "wikilink")'s "breast shots in
bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure" while some of her décollete gowns
were thought "...intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect
beyond even extreme decolletage."[60] But other actresses defied the
then standards. For example, [Gina
Lollobrigida](Gina_Lollobrigida "wikilink") raised eyebrows with her
famous low-cut dress in 1960, and other celebrities, performers and
models followed suit, and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles
of various depths are now common in many situations. During the 1950s,
Hollywood and the fashion industry successfully promoted large cloven
bustlines (and [falsies](falsies "wikilink")). In the late 1960s,
erogenous attention began to shift from the large bust to the trim lower
torso, reasserting the need to diet, especially as new clothing fashions
— brief, sheer, and close fitting — prohibited heavy reliance on
foundation lingerie. Legs were relatively less emphasized as elements of
beauty.[61]

From the 1960s onward, however, changes in fashions were towards
increasing displays of cleavage in films and television, with Jane
Russell and [Elizabeth Taylor](Elizabeth_Taylor "wikilink") being the
biggest stars who led the fashion,[62] and in everyday life low-cut
dress styles became very common, even for casual wear.[63] The Wonderbra
was created in 1964 by Louise Poirier for Canadelle, a Canadian lingerie
company. It had 54 design elements that lift and support the bustline
while creating a deep plunge and push-together effect.

The ideal of breasts and cleavage has also evolved in the later half of
the 20th century, with shapes enhanced by use of a variety of [methods
and techniques](#Cleavage_enhancement "wikilink"). In the 1950s the
preferred shape was pointy, echoing the
[sci-fi](Science_fiction "wikilink") look of the times; in the 1960s it
was elegantly sloped in alignment with [Hippie
chic](Hippie_chic "wikilink") of the times; and from the 1990s a buffed,
pumped and engorged look has become the preference.[64]

### 21st century

![](Zoë_Bell_07.jpg "fig:Zoë_Bell_07.jpg") in a low-cut dress at a film
premiere, 2006\]\]

21st century women's fashions, especially at formal occasions, has
increasingly included low-cut dress designs which expose cleavage. Such
dress designs have been most noticeable at various awards presentations,
such as those seen at the 2016 [Academy
Awards](Academy_Awards "wikilink").[65][66] However, such low-cut
dresses still attract comment, though less controversy. It was also
noticeable in the 2013 film *[American
Hustle](American_Hustle "wikilink")*, as well as in films which expose
cleavage in a low-cut bra or swimsuit.

Display of cleavage can still be controversial. In the United States, in
two separate incidents in 2007, [Southwest
Airlines](Southwest_Airlines "wikilink") crews asked travelers to modify
their clothing, to wear sweaters or to leave the airplane because the
crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable.[67]
In Langley, British Columbia, a young woman was sent home from her high
school for wearing a top that her principal deemed inappropriate because
"it showed too much cleavage."[68][69][70] German Chancellor [Angela
Merkel](Angela_Merkel "wikilink") created controversy when she wore a
low-cut evening gown to the opening of the [Oslo Opera
House](Oslo_Opera_House "wikilink") in 2008;[71][72] U.S. Senator
[Hillary Clinton](Hillary_Clinton "wikilink") and British Home Secretary
[Jacqui Smith](Jacqui_Smith "wikilink") drew attention for wearing
low-cut blouses that revealed a small amount of cleavage, resulting in
comments in the *Washington Post* and the *New York Times.*[73][74]
[Vera Lengsfeld](Vera_Lengsfeld "wikilink"), the Conservative Christian
Democratic Union candidate for Berlin's Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg
district, used pictures of herself and German Chancellor [Angela
Merkel](Angela_Merkel "wikilink") in low-cut dresses during her
political campaign. Facing a tough campaign, she posted 750 provocative
campaign posters, accompanied by the slogan "We Have More to Offer" to
draw attention to "serious election issues." The posters had a positive
impact.[75]

## Cleavage enhancement

Various methods have been used by women in history to enhance their
[physical attractiveness](physical_attractiveness "wikilink") and
femininity including the accentuation and display of breasts within the
context of fashions and norms of modesty of the time and place.

### Underwear

[Corsets](Corset "wikilink") that enhanced cleavage were introduced in
the mid-16th century.[76] By the late 18th century, cleavage-enhancing
corsets grew more dramatic in pushing the breasts upward.[77] The tight
lacing of corsets worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized
both cleavage and the size of the bust and hips. Especially evening or
ball gowns were designed to display and emphasize the
décolletage.[78][79]

When corsets became unfashionable, [brassieres](brassiere "wikilink")
and padding helped to project, display and emphasize the breasts. In
1893, New Yorker Marie Tucek was granted a patent for a "breast
supporter," described as a modification of the corset, and was very
similar to a modern [push-up bra](push-up_bra "wikilink") designed to
support the breasts. It consisted of a plate made of metal, cardboard or
other stiff material shaped to fit against the torso under the breasts,
following the contour of the breasts. It was covered with silk, canvas
or other cloth, which extended above the plate to form a pocket for each
breast. The plate curved around the torso and ended near the
armpits.[80][81]

Development of the underwire bra started in the 1930s,[82] though it did
not gain widespread popularity until the 1950s, when the end of [World
War II](World_War_II "wikilink") freed metal for domestic use.[83][84]
Aviator and filmmaker [Howard Hughes](Howard_Hughes "wikilink") designed
a prototype for an aerodynamic underwire bra for [Jane
Russell](Jane_Russell "wikilink") when filming *[The
Outlaw](The_Outlaw "wikilink")* in 1941. According to Hughes, the
resultant amount was "the length of the actual cleavage is five and
one-quarter inches."[85] Several brassiere manufacturers, among them
[Wonderbra](Wonderbra "wikilink") and [Victoria's
Secret](Victoria's_Secret "wikilink"), produce push-up and other types
of bras that enhance cleavage. [Frederick's of
Hollywood](Frederick's_of_Hollywood "wikilink") introduced a design
called Hollywood Extreme Cleavage Bra that helped give the impression of
a spherical cleavage like augmented breasts that was popularized by
stars like [Pamela Anderson](Pamela_Anderson "wikilink").[86]

### Taping

Many women, such as beauty pageant participants and
[transgender](transgender "wikilink") people, create cleavage by using
tape underneath and across their breast, bending forward, tightly
pulling them together and up.[87][88][89] Types of tape used include
surgical micropore tape and athletic tape. Some also use a strip of
[moleskin](moleskin "wikilink") under the breasts with tape at the ends
to hold it in place. Use of the wrong techniques or tape with too strong
an adhesive can cause injuries such as rashes, blisters and skin being
torn off.[90][91]

### Surgery

Bigger breasts are easier to push together to accent the hollow between
them.[92] Some flat-chested women feel self-conscious about their small
breasts and want to improve their sexual attractiveness by seeking
[breast augmentation](breast_augmentation "wikilink").[93] Plastic
surgeon Gerard H. Pitman says, "you can't have cleavage with an A cup.
You have to be at least a B or a C."[94] A similar statement was made
for non-surgical cleavage enhancement as well (i.e. lingerie
manufacturers [Frederick's of
Hollywood](Frederick's_of_Hollywood "wikilink") promises "high-rise
cleavage to small busts" and Curvees in Etam claims to give girls with a
B cup an "exciting C cup cleavage").[95]

Breast surgery for emplacing [breast
implants](breast_implant "wikilink") can be done for three purposes:

1.  primary reconstruction to replace breast tissues damaged by
    [trauma](Trauma_(medicine) "wikilink")
    ([blunt](blunt_trauma "wikilink"),
    [penetrating](penetrating_trauma "wikilink"),
    [blast](blast_injury "wikilink")), disease (breast cancer) and
    failed anatomic development ([tuberous
    breast](tuberous_breast "wikilink") deformity).
2.  revision and reconstruction to revise (correct) the outcome of a
    previous breast reconstruction surgery.
3.  primary augmentation to aesthetically augment the size, form and
    feel of the [breasts](breast "wikilink").

For [breast reconstruction](breast_reconstruction "wikilink") and for
the augmentation and enhancement of the aesthetics — size, shape, and
texture — of a woman's breasts, there are two types of breast implant
devices in practice: saline implants filled with sterile [saline
solution](saline_(medicine) "wikilink") and silicone implants filled
with viscous [silicone](silicone "wikilink") gel.

If a surgeon attempts to create or increase cleavage by loosening the
medial borders of the breasts, it could result in
[symmastia](symmastia "wikilink"), a confluence of the breast tissue of
both breasts across the midline anterior to the
[sternum](Human_sternum "wikilink"), creating a lack of defined
cleavage.[96] Procedures are generally followed during [breast
reconstruction](breast_reconstruction "wikilink") to preserve a natural
cleavage of breasts.[97]

### Exercise

Regular exercise of the muscles and fibres of the pectoral complex,
which lies just under the fatty tissues of the breast, helps prevent
droopiness and can create the illusion of larger and firmer breasts and
an enhanced cleavage.[98][99][100] [Weight
training](Weight_training "wikilink"), use of exercise machines, [push
ups](push_up "wikilink") and chest presses are considered helpful, as
well as a number of other exercises, including
[rowing](rowing "wikilink") and basketball.[101] In some forms of
exercise, breasts unsupported by a [sports bra](sports_bra "wikilink")
are exposed to greater risk of
[droopiness](Ptosis_(breasts) "wikilink").[102][103]

### Make up

Making cleavage appear deeper and the breasts look fuller alongside the
cleavage with makeup is achieved using [shading](Contouring "wikilink")
effects. The middle of the cleavage is made to look deeper by using a
darker makeup colour than the base colour of the skin, while the most
prominent areas of the breasts (either side of the cleavage) are made to
look larger or more protruding by the use of a paler colour.[104][105]
