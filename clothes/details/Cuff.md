[thumb\|Roman Catholic [Canon](Canon_(priest) "wikilink") with
ornamented cuff](/File:Superior-college.JPG "wikilink") A **cuff** is a
layer of fabric at the lower edge of the [sleeve](/sleeve "wikilink") of
a [garment](/garment "wikilink") (shirt, coat, jacket, etc.) at the
wrist, or at the ankle end of a trouser leg. The function of turned-back
cuffs is to protect the cloth of the garment from
[fraying](/Wikt:fray "wikilink"), and, when frayed, to allow the cuffs
to be readily repaired or replaced, without changing the garment. Cuffs
are made by turning back (folding) the material, or a separate band of
material can be sewn on, or worn separately, attached either by buttons
or studs. A cuff may display an ornamental border or have
[lace](/lace "wikilink") or some other trimming. In US usage, the word
*trouser cuffs* refers to the folded, finished bottoms of the legs of a
pair of [trousers](/trousers "wikilink").

## History

Between the 15th and 18th centuries, rich men often wore sleeve cuffs
ornamented with fine [lace](/lace "wikilink"). Still today, [Catholic
clergy](/Catholic_clergy "wikilink") have the cuffs of their [choir
dress](/choir_dress "wikilink") ornamented with fine lace.

## Shirt cuffs

Except on casual attire, shirt cuffs are generally divided down one edge
and then fastened together, so they can let a hand through and then fit
more snugly around the wrist. Some sweaters and athletic garments (both
tops and pants) have cuffs that either contain elastic or are woven so
as to stretch around a hand or foot and still fit snugly, accomplishing
the same purpose.

Divided shirt cuffs are of three kinds, depending on how they fasten:

-   Button cuffs, also called barrel cuffs, have buttonholes on the one
    side and buttons on the other (sometimes more than one, so that the
    fit can be adjusted).
-   Link cuffs, which have buttonholes on both sides and are meant to be
    closed with [cufflinks](/cufflink "wikilink") or [silk
    knots](/silk_knot "wikilink"). They are most commonly fastened in
    either the "kissing" style, where the insides of both sides are
    pressed together, or very unusually with the outer face touching the
    inner face, as with a button cuff (though this is unorthodox). Link
    cuffs come in two kinds:
    -   Single cuffs, the original linked cuff, are required for [white
        tie](/white_tie "wikilink") and are the more traditional choice
        for [black tie](/black_tie "wikilink"). Also, some
        traditionalists may wear this style with [lounge
        suits](/lounge_suit "wikilink") as well.
    -   French, or double, cuffs, are twice as long and worn folded back
        on themselves. French cuffs were once considered to be more
        formal than button cuffs, although they are seeing a resurgence
        in [business wear](/business_wear "wikilink"), particularly in
        [Europe](/Europe "wikilink"). Even though traditionally French
        cuffs could only be worn with a [lounge
        suit](/lounge_suit "wikilink") or more formal clothing (and not
        a [sports jacket](/sports_jacket "wikilink")), this is now not
        followed by most, while some even wear these cuffs without a tie
        or jacket. They remain the preferred choice for
        [formal](/Formal_wear "wikilink"),
        [semi-formal](/semi-formal "wikilink"), occations. French cuffs
        should generally be paired with
        [cufflinks](/cufflinks "wikilink").[1]
-   Convertible cuffs may be closed with buttons or with cufflinks.

Anatomy of the single or double cuff: The fabric is folded back onto
itself, thus the inside of the shirt sleeve becomes the outside of the
cuff and the outside of the shirt sleeve, becomes the inside of the
cuff.

## Trouser cuffs

[thumb\|Tight-rolled jeans
cuffs](/Image:The_perfect_tight_roll.jpg "wikilink") Most trouser legs
are finished by [hemming](/hem "wikilink") the bottom to prevent
fraying. Trousers with turn-ups ("cuffs" in [American
English](/American_English "wikilink") and elsewhere), after hemming,
are rolled outward and sometimes pressed or stitched into place. The
functional reason for the cuffs is to add weight to the bottom of the
leg, to help the drape of the trousers. Parents may also use cuffs to
extend the life of children's clothes by buying pants that are too long,
cuffing the leg and then unrolling it as the child grows. Originally,
however, it started as men rolling up their trousers to avoid getting
mud splashed on them when roads were still unpaved.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, young people in some countries would
tightly fold or roll the bottoms of their pants. Reportedly, this
"tight-rolled pants" or "pegged pants" [fad](/fad "wikilink") made a
comeback in the [2010s](/2010s_(decade) "wikilink"), beginning in
London.[2]

## Jacket cuffs

The buttons and buttonholes at the end of [suit
jacket](/suit_jacket "wikilink") sleeves are generally decorative and
non-functional. "Surgeonâ€™s cuffs" can be opened at the wrist,[3] and are
traditionally associated with [bespoke
tailoring](/bespoke_tailoring "wikilink").
