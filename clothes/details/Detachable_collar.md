A **detachable collar** is a [shirt](/dress_shirt "wikilink")
[collar](/collar_(clothing) "wikilink") separate from the shirt,
fastened to it by studs. The collar is usually made of a different
fabric from the shirt, in which case it is almost always white, and,
being unattached to the shirt, can be specially
[starched](/starch#Clothing_starch "wikilink") to a hard cardboard-like
consistency.

## History

Some believe that Hannah Montague invented this collar in
[Troy](/Troy,_New_York "wikilink"), [New
York](/New_York_(state) "wikilink"), in 1827, after she snipped off the
collar from one of her husband's shirts to wash it, and then sewed it
back on.[1] The Rev. Ebenezar Brown, a businessman in town, proceeded to
commercialize it. The manufacture of detachable collars and the
associated shirts became a significant industry in Troy.

It was later that the benefit of being able to
[starch](/starch "wikilink") the collars became apparent, and for a
short time, various other parts of the shirt, such as the front and
cuffs, were also made detachable and treated to rigid stiffness. As more
emphasis started to be placed on comfort in clothing this practice
declined, and the stiff collar is the last surviving use of such heavily
starched cotton in daywear; while a [full dress
shirt](/dress_shirt#Formal_shirts "wikilink") (worn with [white
tie](/white_tie "wikilink") and occasionally [black
tie](/black_tie "wikilink")) still has a stiff, but attached, front and
cuffs to accompany the stiff detachable collar.

## Using a detachable collar

[thumb\|left\|A pair of collar studs; the longer left one is the front
stud](/Image:CollarStuds.jpg "wikilink") The collar is attached to the
shirt by a pair of studs like those shown. The shirt has a tunic collar,
a short upright band of fabric with a hole at the back and one on each
side at the front. The stiff collar is attached at the back before the
shirt is donned (and the tie placed under the collar for a [turndown
collar](/turndown_collar "wikilink")), then the shirt is put on, after
which the front stud is pushed through the collar to fasten it.

Detachable collars are often used by [barristers](/barrister "wikilink")
in the UK, Ireland and Canada, many of whom wear a winged collar when in
court to allow the use of [bands](/bands_(neckwear) "wikilink"). On the
way to and from court, a turndown collar and tie is worn. Another common
use of detachable collars now is a [clerical
collar](/clerical_collar "wikilink") (or "Roman Collar"), though these
are now often made from flexible plastic for ease of washing, and are
not always now attached in the traditional way with studs. Also, at
[Eton College](/Eton_College "wikilink"), all pupils wear stiff collars,
mostly turndown collars, while students in positions of authority wear
'stick-ups', which includes a wing collar.[2]

Outside these situations, detachable collars are less common. Stiff
collars in particular with daywear in the 21st century are generally
rare, but if one is worn, it is usually a turndown collar, though
[morning dress](/morning_dress "wikilink") is seen still with a [wing
collar](/Collar_(clothing) "wikilink"). Older styles, such as the
imperial collar (a high collar with no wings last popular with the
[Edwardians](/Edwardian_era "wikilink")), are not frequently seen now. A
more common use of detachable collars is with eveningwear, in which case
a high wing collar is worn in America although turn-down collars are
preferred for black-tie in Britain as per Edward VIII.

To starch a collar, it must be rinsed in boiling water to remove any
starch, then laundered as normal. After soaking in a concentrated warm
starch solution, it is left until nearly dry, then ironed until hard.
While ironing, the shape is added by curling, or using a collar press.
