A **fly** (also known as a **fly front**) on clothing is a covering over
an opening concealing the mechanism, such as a [zip](/zipper "wikilink")
or [buttons](/button_(clothing) "wikilink"),[1] used to close the
opening. An **open fly** is a fly that has been left
[unzipped](/zipper "wikilink") or
[unbuttoned](/Button_(clothing) "wikilink").

## Scope

The term is most frequently applied to a short opening over the
[groin](/groin "wikilink") in [trousers](/trousers "wikilink"), shorts,
and other garments, such as in [men's
briefs](/Briefs#Men's_briefs "wikilink"), where the fly facilitates
[urination](/urination "wikilink") without removal of
[undergarments](/undergarment "wikilink"). The term is also used of
[overcoats](/overcoat "wikilink"), where a design of the same shape is
used to hide a row of buttons. This style is common on a wide range of
coats, from single-breasted
[Chesterfields](/Chesterfield_coat "wikilink") to [covert
coats](/covert_coat "wikilink").

## History

Trousers have varied historically in whether or not they have flies.
Originally, trousers did not have flies or other openings, being pulled
down for sanitary functions. The use of a
[codpiece](/codpiece "wikilink"), a separate covering attached to the
trousers, became popular in 16th-century Europe, eventually evolving
into an attached fall-front (or broad fall). The fly-front (split fall)
emerged later.[2] The panelled front returned as a sporting option, such
as in riding breeches, but is now hardly used, flies being by far the
most common fastening. Most flies now use a zip, though button flies
continue in use. The presence of hard steely material within the fly
reportedly may on occasion result in damage to nerve endings in erectile
tissue in men if there is prolonged and repeated contact between the
surface and the semi or fully erect penile glans.[3]
