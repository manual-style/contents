[thumb\|right\|200px\|[Moccasin](Moccasin "wikilink") with

[textile trim](/trim_(sewing) "wikilink") applied to an edge of a
[textile](/textile "wikilink") item, such as
[drapery](/drapery "wikilink"), a [flag](/flag "wikilink"), or
[epaulettes](/epaulettes "wikilink").

Fringe originated as a way of preventing a cut piece of
[fabric](/Textile "wikilink") from unraveling when a
[hemming](/hem "wikilink") was not used. Several strands of
[weft](/weft "wikilink") threads would be removed, and the remaining
warp threads would be twisted or braided together to prevent unraveling.
In modern fabrics, fringe is more commonly made separately and sewn on.
Modern "add-on" fringe may consist of [wool](/wool "wikilink"),
[silk](/silk "wikilink"), [linen](/linen "wikilink"), or narrow strips
of [leather](/leather "wikilink"). The use of fringe is ancient, and
early fringes were generally made of unspun wool (rather than spun or
twisted threads).[1]

There are many types of fringe. Particularly in Western Europe, as
wealth and luxury items proliferated during [the
Renaissance](/the_Renaissance "wikilink"), types of fringe began to
assume commonly accepted names. Styles of fringes were clearly defined
in [England](/England "wikilink") by at least 1688.[2]

Type of fringe include:

-   **Bullion fringe**, twisted yarn which generally contains threads of
    [silver](/silver "wikilink") or [gold](/gold "wikilink").[3] The
    name derives from bullion [hose](/Hose_(clothing) "wikilink"), which
    had a twisted element at the top that resembled this type of
    fringe.[4] Modern bullion fringe varies widely in texture and width,
    but generally is only in length.[5]
-   **Campaign fringe**, from the [French](/French_language "wikilink")
    word *campane* (meaning "bell"), consists of small, bell-like
    [tassels](/tassel "wikilink") on the end.[6]
-   **Thread fringe**, untwisted and unbraided loose warp threads.[7]
