A **gore** is a sector of a curved surface [1] or the curved surface
that lies between two close lines of longitude on a globe and may be
flattened to a plane surface with little distortion. [2] The term has
been extended to include similarly shaped pieces such as the panels of a
hot-air balloon or parachute, [3] or the triangular insert that allows
extra movement in a garment. [4]

-   [Spherical globes](Globe#Spherical_globe "wikilink") of the
    [Earth](Earth "wikilink") and [Celestial
    sphere](Celestial_sphere "wikilink") were first mass-produced by
    [Johannes Schöner](Johannes_Schöner "wikilink") using a process of
    printing map details on 12 paper gores that were cut out then pasted
    to a sphere. This process is still often used. The gores are
    conveniently made to each have a width of 30 degrees of
    [longitude](longitude "wikilink") matching the principal
    [meridians](Meridian_(geography) "wikilink") from the [South
    Pole](South_Pole "wikilink") and [North Pole](North_Pole "wikilink")
    to the [Equator](Equator "wikilink").
-   [Parachutes](Parachute "wikilink") and [hot air
    balloons](hot_air_balloon "wikilink") are made from gores of
    lightweight material. The gores are cut from flat material and
    stitched together to create various shapes.
-   [Pressure suit](Pressure_suit "wikilink") joints are often
    constructed of alternating gores and convolutes of material
    constrained by cables or straps along the sides of the joint,
    producing an accordion-like structure that flexes with nearly
    constant volume to minimize the mechanical work which must be done
    by the suit occupant.[5]
-   Corners in round [duct-work](Duct_(HVAC) "wikilink") can be created
    by [welding](welding "wikilink") or fixing gores of metal sheet to
    form a bend.
-   Some designers use the [stretched grid
    method](stretched_grid_method "wikilink") to design gores that are
    cut out of weather-resistant fabric and then stitched together to
    form [fabric structures](fabric_structure "wikilink").
