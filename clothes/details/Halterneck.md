[thumb\|right\|Various styles of halterneck
attire](/File:Halter_neck.png "wikilink") **Halterneck** is a style of
[women's clothing](/women's_clothing "wikilink")
[strap](/strap "wikilink") that runs from the front of the garment
around the back of the neck, and leaves most of the back uncovered.[1]
The name comes from livestock [halters](/halter "wikilink").[2] The word
"halter" derives from the Germanic words meaning "that by which anything
is held." [3] Halter is in the German word Büstenhalter, the German word
for bra, with Büste meaning female chest and breasts.

The halter style is used with [swimsuits](/swimsuit "wikilink"), to
maximize [sun tan](/sun_tan "wikilink") exposure on the back and
minimize [tan lines](/tan_lines "wikilink"). It is also used with
[dresses](/dress "wikilink") or [shirts](/shirt "wikilink"), to create a
[backless dress](/backless_dress "wikilink")[4] or top. The neck strap
can itself be covered by the wearer's [hair](/hair "wikilink"), leaving
the impression from behind that nothing is holding the dress or shirt
up.

If a [bra](/brassiere "wikilink") is worn with a halter top, it is
generally either strapless or of halterneck construction itself, so as
to avoid exposing the back straps of a typical bra.

A **halter top** is a type of [sleeveless
shirt](/sleeveless_shirt "wikilink") similar to a [tank
top](/tank_top_(shirt) "wikilink") (by the [American
English](/American_English "wikilink") definition) but with the straps
being tied behind the neck. In another style of the halter top, there is
only a narrow strap behind the neck and a narrow strap behind the middle
of the back, so that it is mostly backless. This design resembles many
[bikini](/bikini "wikilink") tops, although it covers the chest more and
may cover some or all of the [abdomen](/abdomen "wikilink") at the
front. {{-}}
