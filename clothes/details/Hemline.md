[thumb\|Prom dresses, with hemlines varying from above-the-ankle (tea
length) to floor length](/Image:Preprom.jpg "wikilink") The **hemline**
is the line formed by the lower [edge](/Hem "wikilink") of a
[garment](/clothing "wikilink"), such as a [skirt](/skirt "wikilink"),
[dress](/dress "wikilink") or [coat](/Coat_(clothing) "wikilink"),
measured from the floor.[1]

The hemline is perhaps the most variable [style
line](/style_line "wikilink") in [fashion](/fashion "wikilink"),
changing [shape](/shape "wikilink") and ranging in height from
[hip](/hip "wikilink")-high to floor-length. What is a fashionable style
and height of hemline has varied considerably throughout the years, and
has also depended on a number of factors such as the age of the wearer,
the occasion for which the garment is worn and the choice of the
individual.

## Types

shorter than they would have been in real
life).](/File:1817-accidents-in-quadrille-dancing.jpg "wikilink")
Similar to [necklines](/neckline "wikilink") and
[waistlines](/waistline_(clothing) "wikilink"), hemlines can be grouped
by their height and shape:

-   floor-length hemlines
-   ankle hemlines
-   midcalf hemlines
-   below-knee hemlines
-   above-knee hemlines
-   mid-thigh hemlines
-   hip-high hemlines
-   handkerchief hemlines
-   diagonal or asymmetric hemlines
-   high-low hemlines, usually short in front and dipping behind
-   other hemlines, such as modern-cut hemlines

Dresses and skirts are also classified in terms of their length:

-   [mini](/Miniskirt "wikilink")
-   [ballerina length](/Ballet_tutu "wikilink")
-   midi
-   tea length
-   [full length](/full_length "wikilink")
-   [maxi](/Maxiskirt "wikilink")
-   [Intermission length](/Intermission_length "wikilink")

## History

[thumb\|Overview chart of changes in hemline height (skirt length),
1805-2005](/Image:Hemline_(skirt_height)_overview_chart_1805-2005.svg "wikilink")
In the [history of Western
fashion](/history_of_Western_fashion "wikilink"), the ordinary public
clothes of upper- and middle-class women varied only between
floor-length and slightly above ankle-length for many centuries before
World War I. Skirts of lower-calf or mid-calf length were associated
with the practical working garments of lower-class or pioneer women,
while even shorter skirt lengths were seen only in certain specialized
and restricted contexts (e.g. sea-bathing costumes, or outfits worn by
ballerinas on stage). It was not until the mid-1910s that hemlines began
to rise significantly (with many variations in height thereafter).
Skirts rose all the way from floor-length to near knee-length in little
more than fifteen years (from late in the decade of the 1900s to the
mid-1920s). Between 1919 and 1923 they changed considerably, being
almost to the floor in 1919, rising to the mid-calf in 1920, before
dropping back to the ankles by 1923.[2] 1927 saw
"[flapper](/flapper "wikilink") length" skirts at the kneecap and
higher, before shifting down again in the 1930s.[3]

From World War I to roughly 1970, women were under social pressure to
wear skirts near to the currently fashionable length or be considered
unstylish, but since the 1970s, women's options have widened, and there
is no longer really only one single fashionable skirt-length at a time.

Another influence on the length of a woman's skirt is the [hemline
index](/hemline_index "wikilink"), which, oversimplified, states that
hemlines rise and fall in sync with the stock market. The term was
brought up by Wharton Business School Professor [ George
Taylor](George_W._Taylor_(professor) "wikilink") in 1926 at a time when
hemlines rose with flapper dresses during the so-called Roaring '20s.
The Great Depression subsequently set in and hemlines fell to the floor
once again.
