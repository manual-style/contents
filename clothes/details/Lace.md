**Lace** is a delicate [fabric](/fabric "wikilink") made of
[yarn](/yarn "wikilink") or [thread](/thread_(yarn) "wikilink") in an
open weblike pattern,[1] made by machine or by hand.

Originally [linen](/linen "wikilink"), [silk](/silk "wikilink"), gold,
or silver threads were used. Now lace is often made with
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink") thread, although linen and silk threads are
still available. Manufactured lace may be made of [synthetic
fiber](/synthetic_fiber "wikilink"). A few modern artists make lace with
a fine copper or silver wire instead of thread.

## Etymology

The word lace is from [Middle English](/Middle_English "wikilink"), from
[Old French](/Old_French "wikilink") *las*, noose, string, from Vulgar
[Latin](/Latin "wikilink") \**laceum*, from Latin *laqueus*, noose;
probably akin to *lacere*, to entice or ensnare.[2]

There are many types of lace, classified by how they are made. These
include:

-   **[Bobbin lace](/Bobbin_lace "wikilink")**, as the name suggests, is
    made with bobbins and a [pillow](/lace_pillow "wikilink"). The
    bobbins, turned from wood, bone, or plastic, hold threads which are
    woven together and held in place with pins stuck in the pattern on
    the pillow. The pillow contains straw, preferably
    [oat](/oat "wikilink") [straw](/straw "wikilink") or other materials
    such as sawdust, insulation styrofoam, or ethafoam. Also known as
    Bone-lace. [Chantilly lace](/Chantilly_lace "wikilink") is a type of
    bobbin lace.
-   **[Chemical lace](/Chemical_lace "wikilink")**: the stitching area
    is stitched with embroidery threads that form a continuous motif.
    Afterwards, the stitching areas are removed and only the embroidery
    remains. The stitching ground is made of a water-soluble or
    non-heat-resistant material.
-   **[Crocheted lace](/Crocheted_lace "wikilink")** includes [Irish
    crochet](/Irish_crochet "wikilink"), pineapple crochet, and [filet
    crochet](/filet_crochet "wikilink").
-   **[Cutwork](/Cutwork "wikilink")**, or
    [whitework](/whitework "wikilink"), is lace constructed by removing
    threads from a woven background, and the remaining threads wrapped
    or filled with [embroidery](/embroidery "wikilink").
-   **[Knitted lace](/lace_knitting "wikilink")** includes [Shetland
    lace](/Shetland_knitted_lace "wikilink"), such as the "wedding ring
    shawl", a lace shawl so fine that it can be pulled through a wedding
    ring.[3]
-   **Knotted lace** includes [macramé](/macramé "wikilink") and
    [tatting](/tatting "wikilink"). Tatted lace is made with a shuttle
    or a tatting needle.
-   **[Machine-made](/Lace_machine "wikilink")** lace is any style of
    lace created or replicated using mechanical means.
-   **[Needle lace](/Needle_lace "wikilink")**, such as [Venetian Gros
    Point](/Gros_point_de_venise "wikilink"), is made using a needle and
    [thread](/yarn "wikilink"). This is the most flexible of the
    lace-making arts. While some types can be made more quickly than the
    finest of bobbin laces, others are very time-consuming. Some purists
    regard needle lace as the height of lace-making. The finest antique
    needle laces were made from a very fine thread that is not
    manufactured today.
-   **[Tape lace](/Tape_lace "wikilink")** makes the tape in the lace
    [as it is worked](/Bobbin_tape_lace "wikilink"), or uses a machine-
    or hand-made textile strip formed into a design, then
    [joined](/Tape_lace "wikilink") and embellished with needle or
    bobbin lace.

## History

[thumb\|Early lace on a fragment of *The Virgin and Child* by [Hans
Memling](Hans_Memling "wikilink").[4]](/File:Hans_memling,_madonna_col_bambino_tra_i_santi_giacomo_e_domenico,_1488_ca._03.JPG "wikilink")

The origin of lace is disputed by historians. An Italian claim is a will
of 1493 by the Milanese [Sforza](/House_of_Sforza "wikilink") family.[5]
A Flemish claim is lace on the alb of a worshiping priest in a painting
about 1485 by [Hans Memling](/Hans_Memling "wikilink").[6] But since
lace evolved from other techniques, it is impossible to say that it
originated in any one place.[7]

The late 16th century marked the rapid development of lace, both needle
lace and bobbin lace became dominant in both fashion as well as home
décor. For enhancing the beauty of collars and cuffs, needle lace was
embroidered with loops and picots.[8]

Lace was used by clergy of the early Catholic Church as part of
vestments in religious ceremonies but did not come into widespread use
until the 16th century in the northwestern part of the European
continent.[9] The popularity of lace increased rapidly and the cottage
industry of lace making spread throughout Europe. In 1840, Britain's
Queen Victoria was married in lace, influencing the wedding dress style
until now.[10] In North America in the 19th century,
[missionaries](/missionaries "wikilink") spread the knowledge of lace
making to the [Native
American](/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "wikilink") tribes.[11]
St. [John Francis Regis](/John_Francis_Regis "wikilink") guided many
women out of prostitution by establishing them in the lace making and
[embroidery](/embroidery "wikilink") trade, which is why he became the
[Patron Saint](/Patron_Saint "wikilink") of lace making.[12]

The English diarist [Samuel Pepys](/Samuel_Pepys "wikilink") often wrote
about the lace used for his, his wife's, and his acquaintances'
clothing, and on 10 May 1669, noted that he intended to remove the gold
lace from the sleeves of his coat "as it is fit \[he\] should", possibly
in order to avoid charges of ostentatious living.[13]

[Catherine of Aragon](/Catherine_of_Aragon "wikilink") while exiled in
Ampthill, England, was said to have supported the lace makers there by
burning all her lace, and commissioning new pieces.[14] This may be the
origin of the lacemaker's holiday - Cattern's day. On this day (25 or 26
November) lacemakers were given a day off from work, and Cattern cakes -
small dough cakes made with [caraway seeds](/Caraway "wikilink"), were
used to celebrate.[15]
