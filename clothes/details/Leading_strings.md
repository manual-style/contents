**Leading strings** are strings or straps by which to support a child
learning to walk. In 17th and 18th century [Europe](Europe "wikilink"),
they were narrow straps of fabric attached to children's clothing which
originally functioned as a sort of leash to keep the child from straying
too far or falling as they learned to walk.

Leading strings served two functions: reducing bumps and bruises in
children who are just learning to walk, and restraining young children
who might injure themselves by walking or running into unsafe places.
[Baby walkers](Baby_walker "wikilink") and
[playpens](playpen "wikilink") are now commonly used for this purpose,
or a [child harness](child_harness "wikilink") in older children.
