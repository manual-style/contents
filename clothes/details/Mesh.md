A **mesh** is a barrier made of connected strands of
[metal](metal "wikilink"), [fiber](fiber "wikilink"), or other flexible
or ductile materials. A mesh is similar to a
[web](spider_web "wikilink") or a [net](Net_(textile) "wikilink") in
that it has many attached or woven strands.

## Types

-   A [plastic](plastic "wikilink") mesh may be extruded,
    [oriented](oriented "wikilink"), expanded,
    [woven](weaving "wikilink")[1] or
    [tubular](Cylinder_(geometry) "wikilink"). It can be made from
    [polypropylene](polypropylene "wikilink"),
    [polyethylene](polyethylene "wikilink"), [nylon](nylon "wikilink"),
    [PVC](PVC "wikilink") or [PTFE](PTFE "wikilink").
-   A [metal](metal "wikilink") mesh may be [woven](weaving "wikilink"),
    [knitted](knitting "wikilink"), welded,
    [expanded](Expanded_metal "wikilink"), photo-chemically etched or
    [electroformed](Electroforming "wikilink") ([screen
    filter](screen_filter "wikilink")) from [steel](steel "wikilink") or
    other [metals](metal "wikilink").
-   In [clothing](clothing "wikilink"), mesh is loosely
    [woven](woven "wikilink") or [knitted](knitted "wikilink") fabric
    that has a large number of closely spaced holes. Knitted mesh is
    frequently used for modern sports
    [jerseys](jersey_(clothing) "wikilink") and other clothing like
    [hosiery](hosiery "wikilink") and [lingerie](lingerie "wikilink")
-   A mesh [skin graft](skin_graft "wikilink") is a skin patch that has
    been cut systematically to create a mesh. Meshing of skin grafts
    provides coverage of a greater surface area at the recipient site,
    and also allows for the egress of serous or sanguinous fluid.
    However, it results in a rather pebbled appearance upon healing that
    may ultimately look less aesthetically pleasing.[2]
-   Fiberglass mesh[3] is a neatly woven, crisscross pattern of
    fiberglass thread that can be used to create new products such as
    door screens, filtration components, and reinforced adhesive tapes.
    It is commonly sprayed with a [PVC
    coating](Polyvinyl_chloride "wikilink") to make it stronger, last
    longer, and to prevent [skin
    irritation](Fibreglass_#Health_problems "wikilink").
-   Coiled wire fabric is a type of mesh that is constructed by
    interlocking metal wire coils via a simple corkscrew method. The
    resulting spirals are then woven together to create a flexible metal
    fabric panel. Coiled wire fabric mesh is a product that is used by
    architects to design commercial and residential structures. It is
    also used in industrial settings to protect personnel and contain
    debris. Additionally, coiled wire fabric mesh is used for zoo
    enclosures, typically aviary and small mammal exhibits. [4]

## Uses

-   Meshes are often used to screen out insects. [Wire
    screens](Window_screen "wikilink") on [windows](window "wikilink")
    and [mosquito netting](mosquito_net "wikilink") are meshes.
-   Wire screens can be used to shield against [radio
    frequency](radio_frequency "wikilink") radiation, e.g. in [microwave
    ovens](microwave_oven "wikilink") and [Faraday
    cages](Faraday_cage "wikilink").
-   Metal and nylon wire mesh filters are used in
    [filtration](Water_purification "wikilink").
-   Wire mesh is used in guarding for secure areas and as protection in
    the form of [vandal](Vandalism "wikilink") screens.
-   Wire mesh can be fabricated to produce park benches, [waste
    baskets](waste_basket "wikilink") and other baskets for material
    handling.
-   Woven meshes are basic to [screen
    printing](screen_printing "wikilink").
-   [Surgical mesh](Surgical_mesh "wikilink") is used to provide a
    reinforcing structure in surgical procedures like inguinal
    hernioplasty, and umbilical hernia repair.
-   Meshes are used as drum heads in practice and electronic drum sets.
-   [Fence](Fence "wikilink") for [livestock](livestock "wikilink") or
    [poultry](poultry "wikilink") ([chicken
    wire](chicken_wire "wikilink") or hardware cloth)
-   Humane animal trapping uses woven or welded wire mesh cages
    ([chicken wire](chicken_wire "wikilink") or hardware cloth) to trap
    wild animals like raccoons and skunks in populated areas.
-   Meshes can be used for eyes in masks.
