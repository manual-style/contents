The **neckline** is the top edge of a [garment](/clothing "wikilink")
that surrounds the neck, especially from the front view. Neckline also
refers to the overall line between all the layers of clothing and the
neck and shoulders of a person, ignoring the unseen
[undergarments](/undergarments "wikilink").[1]

For each garment worn above the waist, the neckline is primarily a
[style line](/style_line "wikilink") and may be a boundary for further
shaping of the upper edge of a garment with, for example, a
[collar](/Collar_(clothing) "wikilink"), [cowl](/cowl "wikilink"),
[darts](/dart_(sewing) "wikilink"), or [pleats](/pleat "wikilink"). In
that respect it is similar to the
[waistline](/waistline_(clothing) "wikilink") and
[hemline](/hemline "wikilink").

## List of neckline types

Necklines can be grouped into categories according to their shape and
where they cut across the body:

-   **[polo neck](/polo_neck "wikilink")** (circular)


these are high close-fitting collars that wrap around the neck itself,
and are also called **turtlenecks**. They are most common for sweaters
(also called jumpers) or jerseys.[2]

-   **jewel neckline** (circular)


these are round and sit at the base of the throat, and are also called
the **[T-shirt](/T-shirt "wikilink") neckline** or '''[crew
neck](/crew_neck "wikilink").

-   **[scoop neck](/scoop_neck "wikilink")** (curved, concave up)


these have a curved U-shape, with the arms of the U hanging on the
shoulders. The depth of the U can vary, ranging from demure styles to
plunging.

-   **V-neck** (2–4 linear edges, side edges diverge)


originating from the Middle East, these are formed by two diagonal lines
from the shoulders that meet on the chest creating a V shape. The depth
of the V can vary, ranging from demure styles to plunging. The V may
also be truncated by a small bottom edge, forming a
[trapezoid](/trapezoid "wikilink").

-   **surplice neckline**


these are similar to how a bathrobe's neckline is formed by one side of
the garment overlapping the other. For a dress, the lower layer is
usually sewn to the top layer just under the bust.

-   **portrait neckline**


a portrait neckline is a v-neck with the edges of the v placed out at
the points of the shoulders rather than closer to the neck; it can be
combined with a surplice neckline.[3]

-   **square neck** (linear side edges neither converge nor diverge)


these are characterized by three linear edges, the bottom edge meeting
the side edges at right angles. The bottom edge cuts across the figure
horizontally and the side edges pass over the shoulders. A special case
of this is the **slot neckline**, in which the side edges are very close
(roughly the width of the collar-bone points), forming a narrow slot.

-   **deep or plunging neck**


these are low necklines, in either V, U or square shapes, that reveal
various amounts of [cleavage](/Cleavage_(breasts) "wikilink"), and some
even extending to the natural waist line.

-   **[boat neck](/boat_neck "wikilink")** (one edge, nearly linear)


a high, wide, slightly curved neckline that passes past the collarbones
and hangs on both shoulders; also called a **bateau neckline** or
**Sabrina neckline**. A variation is the **portrait neckline**.

-   **off-the-shoulder** (one edge, nearly linear. Also known as Carmen
    neckline)


these are similar to boat necklines but are significantly lower, below
the shoulders and collar bone. Usually these pass *over* the arms but,
in the **strapless neckline** style, may pass under the arms. These
necklines accentuate the shoulders and neck of the wearer.

-   **one-shoulder neckline** (one edge, nearly linear)


these are asymmetrical linear necklines that cut across the torso
diagonally, usually from one shoulder to under the other arm.

-   **[halter](/halterneck "wikilink") neckline** (linear, side edges
    converge on neck)


these feature a V-neck or scoop front neckline with straps which wrap
around and connect at the nape of the neck.

-   **sweetheart neckline** (side edges linear, curved bottom edge
    concave down)


these have a curved bottom edge that is concave down and usually doubly
scalloped to resemble the top half of a heart. The side edges often
converge on the neck, similar to halter necklines. Sweetheart necklines
accentuate the bosom.

-   **keyhole neckline**


these are similar to halter necklines, but the converging diagonal lines
meet in front of the neck, forming a "keyhole". More generally, these
feature a central hole, usually just below the collar bones. These
necklines are seen infrequently.

-   **illusion neckline**


a compromise between a low and a high neckline, it combines a low
(usually strapless) neckline with semi-transparent fabric ([sheer
fabric](/sheer_fabric "wikilink") or [lace](/lace "wikilink")) along the
top part, thus creating a second, higher neckline.[4][5] This neckline
is often seen on traditional white [wedding
dresses](/wedding_dress "wikilink").

## Modifications of necklines

The shape of a necklines can be modified in many ways, e.g., by adding a
[collar](/collar_(clothing) "wikilink") or [scarf](/scarf "wikilink"),
overlaying it with a gauzy material or decorating the edges with
scallops, [picots](/picot "wikilink") or ruffles. The neckline can be a
sharp edge of fabric or a more gentle cowl, and can also be accentuated
by pattern(s) in the fabric itself.

[Ruffs](/ruff_(clothing) "wikilink") were popular in the
[Elizabethan](/Elizabethan "wikilink") era.

The off-the-shoulder trend dates back to the
[Regency](/Regency_era "wikilink") and [Victorian
Era](/Victorian_era "wikilink"). They were the height of fashion in the
early to mid-nineteenth century. [Charles Frederick
Worth](/Charles_Frederick_Worth "wikilink"), the father of [haute
couture](/haute_couture "wikilink"), designed many elaborate dresses,
many of which featured bodices with off-the-shoulder sleeves and were
very popular with prominent figures like .[6] Then in 1960s, French
actress [Brigitte Bardot](/Brigitte_Bardot "wikilink") put her own twist
on this style, wearing off-the-shoulder tops with everything from midi
skirts to pants, reviving the style. The style icon made
off-the-shoulder sexy and trendy again and off-the-shoulder style also
became known as the “Bardot” style.

Since resurfacing in 2014, off-the-shoulder trend has gained massive
popularity. This look gives a sexy appeal without being too overt and
looks good on a variety of body types; thus its popularity with
consumers today.
