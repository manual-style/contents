spelled *placquet*) is an opening in the upper part of
[trousers](/trousers "wikilink") or [skirts](/skirt "wikilink"), or at
the neck or [sleeve](/sleeve "wikilink") of a garment.[1] Plackets are
almost always used to allow clothing to be put on or removed easily, but
are sometimes used purely as a design element. Modern plackets often
contain fabric [facings](/facing_(sewing) "wikilink") or attached bands
to surround and reinforce [fasteners](/fastener "wikilink") such as
[buttons](/Button_(clothing) "wikilink"),
[snaps](/Snap_fastener "wikilink"), or [zippers](/zipper "wikilink").

## Construction

In modern usage, the term *placket* often refers to the double layers of
[fabric](/fabric "wikilink") that hold the buttons and buttonholes in a
[shirt](/shirt "wikilink"). Plackets can also be found at the neckline
of a shirt, the [cuff](/cuff "wikilink") of a sleeve, or at the waist of
a [skirt](/skirt "wikilink") or pair of
[trousers](/trousers "wikilink").

Plackets are almost always made of more than one layer of fabric, and
often have [interfacing](/interfacing "wikilink") in between the fabric
layers. This is done to give support and strength to the placket fabric
because the placket and the fasteners on it are often subjected to
stress when the garment is worn. The two sides of the placket often
overlap. This is done to protect the wearer from fasteners rubbing
against their skin and to hide underlying clothing or undergarments.

## Variations

A button-front shirt without a separate pieced placket is called a
"French placket."[2] The fabric is simply folded over and the buttonhole
stitching secures the two layers (or three layers if there is an
interlining). This method affords a very clean finish, especially if
heavily patterned fabrics are being used. This method is normally only
used in stiff-fronted formal evening ("white-tie") shirts. However, the
normal, separate placket on a shirt gives a more symmetrical appearance.

If the buttons are concealed by a separate flange or flap of the
shirting fabric running the length of the placket, it is called a "fly
front." The inner placket of a fly front shirt can be made as a less
constructed French placket or as a fully constructed regular placket.

## In historical clothing

Historically, a *placket* may also be:

-   A decorative front-panel used to fill in the opening of a
    [doublet](/doublet_(clothing) "wikilink") or
    [gown](/gown "wikilink") (later called a
    [stomacher](/stomacher "wikilink")). Also spelled *placard.*[3]
-   A decorative panel or "forepart" (see [1500–1550 in
    Fashion](/1500–1550_in_fashion#Gowns "wikilink")) attached to a
    woman's [petticoat](/petticoat "wikilink").[4]
-   An opening or slit in a skirt or petticoat to access a separate,
    hanging [pocket](/pocket "wikilink").[5]
-   A petticoat or skirt pocket.[6]
