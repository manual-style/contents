A **pleat** (older **plait**) is a type of fold formed by doubling
[fabric](/textile "wikilink") back upon itself and securing it in place.
It is commonly used in [clothing](/clothing "wikilink") and
[upholstery](/upholstery "wikilink") to gather a wide piece of fabric to
a narrower circumference.[1]

Pleats are categorized as *pressed*, that is,
[ironed](/Ironing "wikilink") or otherwise heat-set into a sharp crease,
or *unpressed*, falling in soft rounded folds.

Pleats sewn into place are called [tucks](/Tuck_(sewing) "wikilink").

## Types

### Accordion

[thumb\|100px\|Knife pleat](/File:Knifepleat.svg "wikilink") Accordion
pleats or knife pleats are a form of tight pleating which allows the
garment to expand its shape when moving. Accordion pleating is also used
for some dress sleeves, such as pleating the end of the elbow, with the
fullness of the pleat gathered closely at the cuff. This form of
pleating inspired the "skirt dancing" of [Loie
Fuller](/Loie_Fuller "wikilink").[2] Accordion pleats may also be used
in hand fans.

### Box

[thumb\|100px\|Box
pleats](/File:Boxpleats.svg "wikilink")[thumb\|100px\|Double box
pleats](/File:2boxpleats.svg "wikilink") Box pleats are knife pleats
back-to-back, and have a tendency to spring out from the waistline.[3]
They have the same 3:1 ratio as knife pleats, and may also be stacked to
form "stacked-" or "double-box pleats". These stacked box pleats create
more fullness and have a 5:1 ratio. They also create a bulkier seam.
Inverted box pleats have the "box" on the inside rather than the
outside.

### Cartridge

[thumb\|Cartridge pleats](/File:Cartpleats.svg "wikilink") Cartridge
pleats are used to gather a large amount of fabric into a small
waistband or armscye without adding bulk to the seam. This type of
pleating also allows the fabric of the skirt or sleeve to spring out
from the seam. During the 15th and 16th centuries, this form of pleating
was popular in the garments of men and women. Fabric is evenly gathered
using two or more lengths of basting stitches, and the top of each pleat
is whipstitched onto the waistband or armscye. Cartridge pleating was
resurrected in [1840s fashion](/1840s_in_fashion "wikilink") to attach
the increasingly full bell-shaped skirts to the fashionable narrow
waist.[4][5][6]

### Fluted

Fluted pleats or "flutings" are very small, rounded or pressed pleats
used as [trimmings](/trim_(sewing) "wikilink").[7] The name comes from
their resemblance to a [pan flute](/pan_flute "wikilink").

### Fortuny

Fortuny pleats are crisp pleats set in silk fabrics by designer [Mariano
Fortuny](/Mariano_Fortuny_(designer) "wikilink") in the early 20th
century, using a secret pleat-setting process which is still not
understood.

### Honeycomb

Honeycomb pleats are narrow, rolled pleats used as a foundation for
[smocking](/smocking "wikilink").

### Kick

Kick pleats are short pleats leading upwards from the bottom hem of
garments such as skirts or coats, usually at the back. They allow the
garment to drape straight down when stationary while also allowing
freedom of movement.

### Kingussie

[thumb\|Kingussie pleats](/File:Kinguissie_pleats.svg "wikilink")
Kingussie pleats, named after [the town in
Scotland](/Kingussie "wikilink"), are a very rarely seen type of pleat
used in some Scottish [kilts](/kilt "wikilink"). They consist of a
single centrally located box pleat in the rear of the kilt with knife
pleats fanning out on either side.

### Knife

Knife pleats are used for basic gathering purposes, and form a smooth
line rather than springing away from the seam they have been gathered
to. The pleats have a 3:1 ratio–three inches of fabric will create one
inch of finished pleat. Knife pleats can be recognized by the way that
they overlap in the seam.[8]

### Organ

Organ pleats are parallel rows of softly rounded pleats resembling the
pipes of a [pipe organ](/pipe_organ "wikilink"). Carl Köhler[9] suggests
that these are made by inserting one or more gores into a panel of
fabric.

### Plissé

Plissé pleats are narrow pleats set by gathering fabric with stitches,
wetting the fabric, and "setting" the pleats by allowing the wet fabric
to dry under weight or tension. [Linen](/Linen "wikilink") [chemises or
smocks](/chemise "wikilink") pleated with this technique have been found
in the 10th century [Viking](/Viking "wikilink") graves in
[Birka](/Birka "wikilink").[10]

### Rolled

Rolled pleats create tubular pleats which run the length of the fabric
from top to bottom. A piece of the fabric to be pleated is pinched and
then rolled until it is flat against the rest of the fabric, forming a
tube. A variation on the rolled pleat is the stacked pleat, which is
rolled similarly and requires at least five inches of fabric per
finished pleat. Both types of pleating create a bulky seam.

### Watteau

Watteau pleats are one or two box pleats found at the back neckline of
[18th century](/1700–1750_in_fashion "wikilink") [sack-back
gowns](/sack-back_gown "wikilink") and some late [19th
century](/1890s_in_fashion "wikilink") [tea gowns](/tea_gown "wikilink")
in imitation of these. The term is not contemporary, but is used by
costume historians in reference to these styles as portrayed in the
paintings of [Antoine Watteau](/Antoine_Watteau "wikilink").[11]

## Modern usage

Clothing features pleats for practical reasons (to provide freedom of
movement to the wearer) as well as for purely stylistic reasons.

### Shirts, blouses, jackets

[Shirts](/dress_shirt "wikilink") and [blouses](/blouse "wikilink")
typically have pleats on the back to provide freedom of movement and on
the arm where the sleeve tapers to meet the cuff. The standard men's
shirt has a box pleat in the center of the back just below the shoulder
or alternately one simple pleat on each side of the back.

[Jackets](/Jacket "wikilink") designed for active outdoor wear
frequently have pleats (usually inverted box pleats) to allow for
freedom of movement. [Norfolk jackets](/Norfolk_jacket "wikilink") have
double-ended inverted box pleats at the chest and back.

### Skirts and kilts

[thumb\|A girl wearing pleated and [plaid](Plaid_(pattern) "wikilink")
skirt.](/File:Tekkoshocon_2010_cosplayer_with_Mahora_Academy_Middle_School_for_Girls_winter_uniform_from_Negima.jpg "wikilink")

[Skirts](/Skirts "wikilink"), [dresses](/dress_(garment) "wikilink") and
[kilts](/kilt "wikilink") can include pleats of various sorts to add
fullness from the waist or hips, or at the hem, to allow freedom of
movement or achieve design effects.

-   One or more **kick pleats** may be set near the hem of a straight
    skirt to allow the wearer to walk comfortably while preserving the
    narrow style line.
-   Modern kilts may be made with either box pleats or knife pleats, and
    can be *pleated to the stripe* or *pleated to the sett* (see main
    article [Kilts: Pleating and
    stitching](/Kilt#Pleating_and_stitching "wikilink")).

### Trousers

Pleats just below the waistband on the front of the garment are typical
of many styles of formal and casual [trousers](/trousers "wikilink")
including [suit](/suit_(clothing) "wikilink") trousers and khakis. There
may be one, two, three, or no pleats, which may face either direction.
When the pleats open towards the pockets they are called **reverse
pleats** (typical of khakis and corduroy trousers) and when they open
toward the zipper, they are known as **forward pleats**.

Utilitarian or very casual styles such as [jeans](/jeans "wikilink") and
[cargo pants](/cargo_pants "wikilink") are flat-front (without pleats at
the waistband) but may have bellows pockets.

Pleated trousers were popular before World War II; fabric rationing
during the war precluded the style, and flat front became the standard
by necessity of cloth shortages.Pleated pants, especially of the double
reverse pleat variety, were commonplace in the 1980s and 1990s, but by
the late 2000s they had fallen out of favour.[12]

### Pockets

A **bellows pocket** is patch [pocket](/pocket "wikilink") with an inset
box pleat to allow the pocket to expand when filled. Bellows pockets are
typical of cargo pants, [safari jackets](/safari_jacket "wikilink"), and
other utilitarian garments.
