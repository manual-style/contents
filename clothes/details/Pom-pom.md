[thumb\|right\|A pair of [cheerleading](cheerleading "wikilink")
pom-pons](/File:Pompon.jpg "wikilink") A **pom-pom** – also spelled
**pom-pon**, **pompom** or **pompon** – is a decorative ball or tuft of
fibrous material.

The term may refer to large tufts used by
[cheerleaders](/Cheerleading "wikilink"), or a small, tighter ball
attached to the top of a hat, also known as a
[bobble](/Knit_cap#British_bobble_hat "wikilink") or
[toorie](/Pom-pon#Toorie "wikilink").

Pom-poms may come in many colors, sizes, and varieties and are made from
a wide array of materials, including [wool](/wool "wikilink"),
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink"), [paper](/paper "wikilink"),
[plastic](/plastic "wikilink"), [thread](/thread_(yarn) "wikilink"),
[glitter](/glitter "wikilink") and occasionally
[feathers](/feather "wikilink"). Pom-poms are shaken by
[cheerleaders](/Cheerleader "wikilink"), pom or [dance
teams](/dance "wikilink"), and sports fans during [spectator
sports](/spectator_sport "wikilink").

## Spelling and etymology

-   *[Webster's Third New International
    Dictionary](/Webster's_Third_New_International_Dictionary "wikilink")* (1961)
    gives the spelling as "pompon."
-   The *[New Oxford American
    Dictionary](/New_Oxford_American_Dictionary "wikilink")* (third
    edition, 2010) gives the spelling as "pom-pom."
-   The *[American Heritage Dictionary of the English
    Language](/American_Heritage_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language "wikilink")*
    (5th edition, 2011) gives the spelling as "pompom" or "pompon."
-   *Webster's New World College Dictionary* (fourth edition) gives the
    spelling as "pompom."

*Pom-pom*, also called a *pom* or *cheerleading pom*, is derived from
the French word *pompon*, which refers to a small decorative ball made
of fabric or feathers. It also means an "ornamental round tuft" and
originally refers to its use on a hat, or an "ornamental tuft; tuft-like
flower head."[1]

## Sports and cheerleading

[thumb\|right\|Cheerleaders using pom-poms during an [American
football](American_football "wikilink") [halftime
show](/halftime_show "wikilink")](/File:YouthCheerleadingPompons.jpg "wikilink")

Cheerleaders use pom-poms at sports events for six main reasons:

-   to attract the attention of the spectators
-   to accentuate movements
-   to add "sparkle" to a cheer, chant, or dance routine
-   to distract the opposing team
-   to spell out team's name or "go"
-   to use semaphore

pom-poms\|alt=\|left](/File:Sports-Fest1.jpg "wikilink")

Most often, pom-poms are used in pairs (one in each hand), but this may
vary with the particular requirements of the
[choreography](/choreography "wikilink") of a dance or cheer. Pom-poms
are shaken by cheerleaders and sports fans during spectator sports.
Small decorative pom-poms may be attached to clothing; these are called
toories or bobbles.

Cheerleading pom-poms come in a variety of shapes, styles, colors, color
combinations, and sizes. Classically, pom-poms have been made of plastic
but mylar (also called [BoPET](/BoPET "wikilink")) has become
increasingly popular in recent years [2]. The most common size, the 6"
works most age groups or performance type. This size can be used for
dance teams, pom squads, cheerleaders, and majorettes, easily making it
the most versatile strand length on the market [3]. The second most
common size, the 5", is adequate for any age group or performance type,
but the marginally shorter strands provide the necessary flash while
acting more as an accent to the uniform[4].

Pom-poms are also waved by sports fans, primarily at college and high
school sports events in the United States. These inexpensive,
light-weight *faux* pom-poms, or rooter poms, typically come in team
colors, are sometimes given away or sold to spectators at such
events[5].

Many schools and universities have dance teams in addition to their
cheerleading groups. The dance teams may also use pom-poms occasionally,
but many high school dance teams are now referred to as "Poms" squads.
These squads are similar to drill teams, but usually, have several
routines that they strictly use pom-poms. Pom-poms have also come to be
included in dance competitions in the United States. In many states,
"Pom" or "Open Pom" is considered its own style of dance during
competitions. For this style dancers use pom-poms and moves that are
specifically choreographed to include pom-poms, but usually incorporate
hip-hop and jazz choreography as well. When judging a routine in the Pom
or Open Pom category, judges typically look for clean, sharp movements
and complete synchronization of the team. These dances occasionally use
different colored pom-poms and outfits to convey a theme and the dance
team will create pictures from their pom-poms that relate to this
theme.[thumb\|Fans at Australian rules football matches wave floggers

### Flogger

In [Australia](/Australia "wikilink"), the term "flogger" is sometimes
used rather than "pom-pom". Floggers are very large, heavy pom-poms in
the team's colours. They sometimes require more than one person to lift
them, and they are waved about when a goal is scored.

Floggers are an important part of [Australian rules football
culture](/Australian_rules_football_culture "wikilink") and
cheer-squads.

## Clothing

Restoration](/Bourbon_Restoration "wikilink") with a red company
pompon\|alt=\|left](/File:Shako-p1000580.jpg "wikilink") Small pom-poms
may be used to adorn [hats](/hat "wikilink") (such as [Tam o'
Shanters](/Tam_o'_Shanter_(cap) "wikilink") and some styles of the
[tuque](/tuque "wikilink")), [socks](/sock "wikilink"), fringed
[dresses](/dress "wikilink"), and other kinds of clothing.

Red pom-poms form a conspicuous part of the uniform of French naval
personnel, being sewn onto the crown of their round [sailor
caps](/sailor_cap "wikilink"). Belgian sailors wear a light blue
version.

Traditional Italian wedding shoes have small pom-poms, as do some
Turkish dancing shoes.

### Roman Catholic clergy

Roman Catholic clergy wear the [biretta](/biretta "wikilink"). The
colour of its pom-pom denotes the wearer's rank. Priests wear a black
biretta with a black pom. Protonotaries and domestic prelates (now
prelates of honour) have a scarlet pom on their black birettas, and
Papal Chamberlains (now Chaplains to His Holiness) wear a Roman purple
pom on their black birettas.

Bishops and archbishops wear a Roman purple biretta with matching pom.
The scarlet birettas of the cardinals have no pom, only a red loop.
There is no papal biretta.

Some religious orders and congregations have unique birettas, such as
the Norbertines who wear a white biretta with a white pom. Some St.
Francis fathers wear a brown biretta with a black pom. Other orders may
wear a black biretta with a white, green, or blue pom, or the black
biretta of the secular priesthood.

### Toorie

In reference to [Scottish](/Scotland "wikilink") [Highland
dress](/Highland_dress "wikilink") and Scottish military uniforms, the
small pom-pom on the crown of such hats as the
[Balmoral](/Balmoral_bonnet "wikilink"), the
[Glengarry](/Glengarry "wikilink"), and the [Tam o'
Shanter](/Tam_o'_Shanter_(cap) "wikilink") is called a "toorie."

The toorie is generally made of yarn and is traditionally red on both
Balmorals and Glengarries (although specific units have used other
colours). It has evolved into the smaller pom-pom found on older-style
[golf caps](/Flat_cap "wikilink") and the button atop [baseball
caps](/baseball_cap "wikilink").

Scots refer to any such hat decoration as a toorie, irrespective of the
headgear.

## Toys and bicycles

Pom-poms are sometimes used as children's toys. They are a common
feature at the ends of the handlebars of children's
[tricycles](/tricycle "wikilink") and [bicycles](/bicycle "wikilink").
They are also used in children's artistic crafts to add texture and
color.
