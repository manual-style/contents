**"Princess line"** or **"princess dress"** describes a woman's fitted
[dress](/dress "wikilink") or other garment cut in long panels without a
horizontal join or separation at the waist.[2][3] Instead of relying on
[darts](/Dart_(sewing) "wikilink") to shape the garment, the fit is
achieved with long [seams](/Seam_(sewing) "wikilink") and shaped
[pattern pieces](/Pattern_(sewing) "wikilink").[4] A rarely used
alternative name for the Princess line was *French-dart-line
dress*.[5][6]

## History

### 19th century

The princess line is popularly associated with [Charles Frederick
Worth](/Charles_Frederick_Worth "wikilink") who first introduced it in
the early 1870s.[7][8] It was named in honour of the famously elegant
[Princess Alexandra](/Alexandra_of_Denmark "wikilink").[9][10] By the
late 1870s and early 1880s the Princess dress was a popular style. It is
considered one of the first "[bodycon](/bodycon_dress "wikilink")"
(body-conscious) fashions due to its extremely closely fitted design,
presenting the figure in a natural (or at least,
[corseted](/corset "wikilink")) form undistorted by either
[crinoline](/crinoline "wikilink") or [bustle](/bustle "wikilink").[11]
'Princess-line [polonaises](/Polonaise_(clothing) "wikilink")' were worn
over long underskirts.[12] The Princess line was also popular for young
girls, who wore it with a [sash](/sash "wikilink") or, if slightly
older, over a longer underskirt.[13]

### 20th century

The Princess line was a staple of dress design and construction
throughout the century. In 1951 the couturier [Christian
Dior](/Christian_Dior "wikilink") presented a princess-line based
fashion collection which is sometimes called the 'Princess Line,'
although its official name was *Ligne Longue* or 'Long Line'.[14]

### 21st century

The Princess line remains a popular style for [wedding
dresses](/wedding_dress "wikilink") and a design staple for both day and
evening dresses.[15][16] More recently, the design principle has been
consciously applied to men's garments, which generally do not have waist
seams anyway.[17]
