**Princess seams** are long rounded seams sewn into women's
[blouses](/blouse "wikilink") or [shirts](/shirt "wikilink") to add
shaping or a tailored fit to closely follow a woman's shape. They are
sewn into the front and/or back of a shirt, and extend from the waist up
to the arms. Princess seams are distinct from
[darts](/dart_(sewing) "wikilink") in that they form a continuous line
and are a full seam. Darts, on the other hand, are folds sewn into the
clothing to shape the resultant garment.

The princess seam style of [dress](/dress "wikilink") needs no
[waistline](/waistline_(clothing) "wikilink") at all, since it does its
shaping without [darts](/dart_(sewing) "wikilink"), by joining edges of
different curvature. The resulting "princess seams" typically runs from
the [shoulder](/shoulder "wikilink") (or under the arm) curving gently
over the [bust](/breast "wikilink") point and down to the lower
[hem](/hem "wikilink"). This creates a long, slimming look, often seen
in dresses with an "[A-line](/A-line_(clothing) "wikilink")" silhouette.
