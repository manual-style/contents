A **revers** or **rever** is a part of a [garment](garment "wikilink")
that is reversed to display the [lining](lining_(sewing) "wikilink") or
[facing](facing_(sewing) "wikilink") outside.[1] The word is a
corruption of [reverse](:wikt:reverse "wikilink").

The most common form of revers is the [lapel](lapel "wikilink").[2] The
revers emerged in the 1860s[3][4] in [France](France "wikilink") as
soldiers began unbuttoning the fronts of their uniforms. When the revers
became dirty, the uniform could be buttoned up to show a clean front
again.[5]
