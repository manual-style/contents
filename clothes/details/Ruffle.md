[cap](cap "wikilink"), 1789](/File:Gullager_Salisbury.jpg "wikilink") In
[sewing](/sewing "wikilink") and [dressmaking](/dressmaking "wikilink"),
a **ruffle**, **frill**, or **furbelow** is a strip of
[fabric](/textile "wikilink"), [lace](/lace "wikilink") or
[ribbon](/ribbon "wikilink") tightly
[gathered](/gather_(sewing) "wikilink") or [pleated](/pleat "wikilink")
on one edge and applied to a [garment](/clothing "wikilink"),
[bedding](/bedding "wikilink"), or other textile as a form of
[trimming](/trim_(sewing) "wikilink").[1]

A **flounce** is a particular type of fabric manipulation that creates a
similar look but with less bulk. The term derives from earlier terms of
*frounce* or *fronce*.[2] A wavy effect is achieved without gathers or
pleats by cutting a curved strip of fabric and applying the inner or
shorter edge to the garment. The depth of the curve as well as the width
of the fabric determines the depth of the flounce. A
[godet](/godet_(sewing) "wikilink") is a circle wedge that can be
inserted into a flounce to further deepen the outer floating wave
without adding additional bulk at the point of attachment to the body of
the garment, such as at the hemline, collar or sleeve.

Ruffles appeared at the [draw-string](/draw-string "wikilink") necklines
of full [chemises](/chemise "wikilink") in the 15th century, evolved
into the separately-constructed [ruff](/ruff_(clothing) "wikilink") of
the 16th century. Ruffles and flounces remained a fashionable form of
trim, off-and-on into modern times.[3]
