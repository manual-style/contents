**Shirt stays** are [elastic](/Elastomer "wikilink") straps that connect
the bottom of a [dress shirt](/dress_shirt "wikilink") to the socks or
feet.[1] There are two main varieties: those that loop around the foot
and those that clip onto the sock. All varieties have two clips at the
top, one for the front and one for the back of the shirt. They are often
used in military [dress uniforms](/dress_uniform "wikilink") to prevent
the shirt from untucking during the course of the day. However, many Law
Enforcement, sports officials and professional business and sales people
wear them.

One of the biggest problems with the shirt stays is that they come off.
For this problem there are solutions in the form of belts that go around
your waist, inside your pants. Some are made of rubber and work by
friction to keep the shirt from sliding up. There is at least one style
that has molded hooks that grips the material of the shirt and the pants
keeping the shirt tails tucked.

At present most manufacturing of shirt stays is done in United Kingdom,
China and the United States.
