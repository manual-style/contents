A **shirt stud** is a decorative fastener that fits onto a buttonhole on
the front of a pleated shirt, or onto the starched bib of a stiff-front
shirt. It can be used on dress shirts that are specifically designed
with buttonholes, which are reserved for formal and semi-formal dress in
the traditional western dress code.

## Origin

In the western world, shirt studs were first used in the mid-19th
century, when some shirt fronts were too stiff to close with buttons. So
remains the case for the heavily starched, modern full dress shirts worn
with white tie.

## Materials

A shirt stud may be fashioned from alloys, precious metals, and
gemstonesâ€”materials uncommon to buttons sewn on shirts. The stud may
have an inlay, such as of pearl or onyx.
