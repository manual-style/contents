**Shoulder pads** are a type of fabric-covered padding used in men's and
women's clothing to give the wearer the illusion of having broader and
less sloping shoulders. In the beginning, shoulder pads were shaped as a
semicircle or small triangle, and were stuffed with wool, cotton or
sawdust. They were positioned at the top of the sleeve, to extend the
shoulder line. A good example of this is their use in "leg o' mutton"
sleeves, or the smaller puffed sleeves which were revived at this time,
and were [based on styles from the 1890s](/1890s_in_fashion "wikilink").
In men's styles, shoulder pads are often used in suits, jackets and
overcoats, usually sewn at the top of the shoulder and fastened between
the lining and the outer fabric layer. In women's clothing, their
inclusion depends by the fashion taste of the day. Although from a
non-fashion point of view they are generally for people with narrow or
sloping shoulders, there are also quite a few cases in which shoulder
pads will be necessary for a suit or blazer in order to compensate for
certain fabrics' natural properties, most notably suede blazers, due to
the weight of the material. They were popular additions to clothing
(particularly business clothing) during the 1940s, 1980s, and late
2000s/2010s.

## 1930 to 1945

Shoulder pads originally became popular for women in the 1930s when
fashion designer [Elsa Schiaparelli](/Elsa_Schiaparelli "wikilink")
included them in her designs of 1931. The following year [Joan
Crawford](/Joan_Crawford "wikilink") wore them in the film "Letty
Lynton"[1] in a dress designed by costume designer,
[Adrian](/Adrian_(costume_designer) "wikilink"). This dress was widely
copied and sold in Macy's department stores, helping to popularize the
look.[2]

After [World War II](/World_War_II "wikilink") began in 1939, women's
fashions became increasingly militarised. Jackets, coats, and even
dresses in particular were influenced by masculine styles and shoulder
pads became bulkier and were positioned at the top of the shoulder to
create a solid look. In 1945, Joan Crawford wore a fur coat with wide,
exaggerated shoulders also designed by Adrian in the film [Mildred
Pierce](/Mildred_Pierce_(film) "wikilink"). Soon the style was
universal, found in all garments excepting lingerie but tapering off
later in the decade after the war was over and women yearned for a
softer, more feminine look.

## 1945 to 1970

During the late 1940s to about 1951, some dresses featured a soft,
smaller shoulder pad with so little padding as to be barely noticeable.
Its function seems to have been to slightly shape the shoulder line.

By the 1950s, shoulder pads appeared only in jackets and coats—not in
dresses, knitwear or blouses as they had previously during the heyday of
the early 1940s. By the early 1960s, these slowly became less noticeable
and midway through the decade, shoulder pads had disappeared.

## 1970s

Shoulder pads made their next appearance in women's clothing in the
early 1970s, through the influence of British fashion designer [Barbara
Hulanicki](/Barbara_Hulanicki "wikilink") and her label
[Biba](/Biba "wikilink"). Biba produced designs influenced by the styles
of the 1930s and 1940s, and so a soft version of the shoulder pad was
revived. [Ossie Clark](/Ossie_Clark "wikilink") was another London
designer using shoulder pads at the time. These styles did not, however,
reach mainstream acceptance, and so the popularity was relatively short
lived.

## 1980s

During the early 1980s there was a resurgence of interest in the ladies'
evening wear styles of the early 1940s:
[peplums](/wiktionary:peplum "wikilink"), [batwing
sleeves](/batwing_sleeves "wikilink") and other design elements of the
times were re-interpreted for a new market.[3] The shoulder pad helped
define the silhouette and was reintroduced in cut foam versions,
especially in well-cut suits reminiscent of the World War II era.
British Prime Minister [Margaret
Thatcher](/Margaret_Thatcher "wikilink") was internationally noted for
her adoption of these fashions.[4][5] Before too long, these
masculinized shapes were adopted by women seeking success in the
corporate world and became an icon of women's attempts to smash the
[glass ceiling](/glass_ceiling "wikilink"), a mission that was also
added by their notable appearance in the TV series
*[Dynasty](/Dynasty_(1981_TV_series) "wikilink")*.[6]

As the decade wore on, shoulder pads became the defining fashion
statement of the era, known as [power
dressing](/power_dressing "wikilink") and bestowing the perception of
status and position onto those who wore them. They became both larger
and more ubiquitous—every garment from the
[brassiere](/brassiere "wikilink") upwards would come with its own set
of shoulder pads. To prevent excessive shoulder padding,
[velcro](/velcro "wikilink") was sewn onto the pads so that the wearer
could choose how many sets to wear. By the end of the era, some shoulder
pads were the size of dinner plates.

## 1990s

The shoulder pad fashion carried over from the late 1980s with some
popularity in the early 1990s, but the wearer's tastes were changing due
to the backlash against 1980s culture. Some designers continued to
produce ranges featuring shoulder pads into the mid-1990s, as shoulder
pads were prominent in women's formal suits, and matching top-bottom
attire, highly exampled in [The Nanny](/The_Nanny "wikilink"). But as
the decade wore on, the styles were outdated and were shunned by young
and fashion-conscious wearers. Appearances were reduced to smaller,
subtler versions augmenting the shoulder lines of jackets and coats.

## 2000s and 2010s

The late 2000s and early 2010s saw the resurgence of shoulder pads. Many
young women imitated pop artists, mainly [Lady
Gaga](/Lady_Gaga "wikilink") and [Rihanna](/Rihanna "wikilink"), who
were known for their use of shoulder pads in their stylistic outfits.
There was a large presence of shoulder pads on many runways, in fashion
designer collections, and a revival of 1980s trends became mainstream
among many people who were interested in them. By the 2009-2010 seasons,
shoulder pads had made their way back into the mainstream market.[7] By
2010 many retailers like [Wal-Mart](/Wal-Mart "wikilink") had shoulder
pads on at least half of all women's tops and blouses.[8]
