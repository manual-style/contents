Dress shoulder straps are a length of fabric, usually in pairs, used to
support [clothing](/clothing "wikilink"), especially women's clothing,
such as a [dress](/dress "wikilink"), [camisole](/camisole "wikilink"),
[apron](/apron "wikilink") or [brassiere](/brassiere "wikilink").
Shoulder straps such as these are usually made of the same material as
the garment, and may be quite flimsy, as they are normally not expected
to support much weight.

The shoulder straps on some dresses may be very thin, in which case they
may be called a [spaghetti strap](/spaghetti_strap "wikilink") (also
called "noodle strap"). These are common in clothing such as
[camisoles](/camisole "wikilink"), [cocktail
dresses](/cocktail_dress "wikilink"), and [evening
gowns](/evening_gown "wikilink").

Some institutions ban spaghetti strap dresses and bare-shoulder
[strapless dresses](/strapless_dress "wikilink") on grounds of
[modesty](/modesty "wikilink").[1][2]

## Military shoulder strap

[military uniform](/military_uniform "wikilink") shirts, jackets,
tunics, or greatcoats feature shoulder straps. They were originally
designed to keep [back packs](/back_pack "wikilink"), ammunition pouches
or bayonets from slipping off the shoulder. They often display badges of
rank, [shoulder marks](/shoulder_mark "wikilink"), regimental insignia
or [epaulettes](/epaulette "wikilink").

## Carrier shoulder strap

A carrier shoulder strap is a length of fabric or other flexible
material (such as leather, vinyl, rubber), used to suspend an item,
often of some weight, from the shoulder(s). The strap may be worn slung
over one shoulder or across the body. In the interest of comfort, they
often have some manner of padding near the middle, where the strap rests
directly against the shoulder or neck. Such items include
[purses](/Handbag "wikilink"), [guitars](/guitar "wikilink"),
[rifles](/rifle "wikilink"), etc. In the case of rifles and other such
weaponry, the shoulder strap is usually referred to as a
*[sling](/Sling_(firearms) "wikilink")*. Shoulder straps may also be
used in pairs on such items as a [backpack](/backpack "wikilink") or a
[baby carrier](/baby_carrier "wikilink"); the straps are worn one over
each shoulder, and the item so carried is centred on the back or chest.
Some camera strap manufacturers, such as
[BlackRapid](/BlackRapid "wikilink"), design their straps to fit over
both shoulders allowing two cameras to rest at hip level.[3]

The use of such straps frees the hands for other use.
