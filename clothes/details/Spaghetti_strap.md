A **spaghetti strap** (also called **noodle strap**[1]) is a very thin
[shoulder strap](/shoulder_strap "wikilink") used to support[2]
clothing, while providing minimal shoulder straps over otherwise bare
shoulders. It is commonly used in garments such as
[swimwear](/swimwear "wikilink"), [camisoles](/camisole "wikilink"),
[crop tops](/crop_top "wikilink"), bras,
[sundresses](/sundress "wikilink"), [cocktail
dresses](/cocktail_dress "wikilink"), and [evening
gowns](/evening_gown "wikilink"), so-named for its resemblance to the
thin pasta strings called *[spaghetti](/spaghetti "wikilink").*

## Trivia

Spaghetti straps may not meet some dress codes. For example, they are
not welcome at [Ascot Racecourse](/Ascot_Racecourse "wikilink").[3]
