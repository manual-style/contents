[thumb\|right\|Folded strap](/File:Hose_strap_folded.jpg "wikilink") A
**strap**, sometimes also called **strop**, is an elongated
[flap](/wikt:flap "wikilink") or [ribbon](/ribbon "wikilink"), usually
of [fabric](/Cloth "wikilink") or [leather](/leather "wikilink").

Thin straps are used as part of [clothing](/clothing "wikilink") or
[baggage](/baggage "wikilink"), or bedding such as a [sleeping
bag](/sleeping_bag "wikilink"). See for example [spaghetti
strap](/spaghetti_strap "wikilink"), [shoulder
strap](/shoulder_strap "wikilink"). A strap differs from a
[belt](/belt_(clothing) "wikilink") mainly in that a strap is usually
integral to the item of clothing; either can be used in combination with
[buckles](/buckle "wikilink").

Straps are also used as [fasteners](/fastener "wikilink") to attach and
bind items, to objects, animals (for example a
[saddle](/saddle "wikilink") on a horse) and people (for example a
[watch](/watch "wikilink") on a [wrist](/wrist "wikilink")), or even to
tie down people and animals, as on an apparatus for [corporal
punishment](/corporal_punishment "wikilink"). Occasionally a strap is
specified after what it binds or holds, e.g. chin strap.[1]
[Webbing](/Webbing "wikilink") is a particular type of strap that is a
strong fabric woven as a flat strip or tube that is also often used in
place of [rope](/rope "wikilink"). Modern webbing is typically made from
exceptionally high-strength material, and is used in automobile [seat
belts](/seat_belts "wikilink"), furniture manufacturing, transportation,
towing, military apparel, cargo fasteners, and many other fields.

## Packaging

Strap is commonly used in the [packaging](/packaging "wikilink")
industry to secure or fasten items. It may be made from a wide range of
materials, such as [plastic](/plastic "wikilink"),
[steel](/steel "wikilink"), [paper](/paper "wikilink"), or
[fabric](/fabric "wikilink"). Usually the strap is secured to itself
through various means, but it may also be secured to other items, such
as [pallets](/pallet "wikilink").
