A **style line** is a seam in a [garment](/Clothing "wikilink") made
primarily for the purpose of its visual effect, rather than for the
purpose of shaping of structuring the garment. By contrast, a
[dart](/Dart_(sewing) "wikilink") or [pleat](/pleat "wikilink") by
itself would not be considered a style line because although each can be
used to produce a pleasing visual effect, their main purpose is to shape
the garment by taking in ease or adding fullness respectively. Clearly
though, there can be some ambiguity as when a dart is made as part of a
seam which continues beyond the dart point. If the seam beyond the dart
is straight, that is, not affecting the garment's fit, it would be
considered a style line.
