**Trim** or **trimming** in [clothing](/clothing "wikilink") and [home
decorating](/home_decorating "wikilink") is applied ornament, such as
[gimp](/Gimp_(thread) "wikilink"),
[passementerie](/passementerie "wikilink"),
[ribbon](/ribbon "wikilink"), [ruffles](/ruffle "wikilink"), or, as a
[verb](/verb "wikilink"), to apply such ornament.

Before the [industrial revolution](/industrial_revolution "wikilink"),
all trim was made and applied by hand, thus making heavily trimmed
furnishings and garments expensive and high-status. Machine-woven trims
and [sewing machines](/sewing_machine "wikilink") put these dense
trimmings within the reach of even modest
[dressmakers](/dressmaker "wikilink") and home sewers, and an abundance
of trimming is a characteristic of mid-[Victorian
fashion](/Victorian_fashion "wikilink").[1] As a predictable reaction,
high [fashion](/fashion "wikilink") came to emphasize exquisiteness of
[cut](/cut_(clothing) "wikilink") and construction over denseness of
trimming, and applied trim became a signifier of
[mass-produced](/mass-produced "wikilink") clothing by the 1930s.[2] The
iconic braid and gold [button](/Button_(clothing) "wikilink") trim of
the [Chanel suit](/Chanel_suit "wikilink") are a notable survival of
trim in high fashion.[3]

In [home decorating](/home_decorating "wikilink"), the 1980s and 1990s
saw a fashion for dense, elaborately layered trimmings on [upholstered
furniture](/upholstered_furniture "wikilink") and
[drapery](/drapery "wikilink").[4]

Today, most trimmings are commercially manufactured.
[Scalamandré](/Scalamandré "wikilink") is known for elaborate trim for
[home furnishings](/home_furnishing "wikilink"), and
[Wrights](/Wrights_(textile_manufacturers) "wikilink") is a leading
manufacturer of trim for home sewing and crafts.
[Conso](/Conso "wikilink") is another leading manufacturer.[5] Trims are
used generally to enhance the beauty of the garments. It attracts
buyers. Appropriate use of it creates more value of the product.
