The **waistline** is the line of demarcation between the upper and lower
portions of a garment, which notionally corresponds to the natural waist
but may vary with fashion from just below the bust to below the hips.
The waistline of a [garment](/clothing "wikilink") is often used to
accentuate different features. The waistline is also important as a
boundary at which shaping [darts](/dart_(sewing) "wikilink") (such as
those over the bust and in the back) can be ended.

## Types of waistlines

Similar to [necklines](/neckline "wikilink"), waistlines may be grouped
by their shape, depth, and location of the body.

-   **None**: The [princess seams](/princess_seams "wikilink") style of
    dress needs no waistline at all, since it does its shaping without
    darts, by joining edges of different curvature. The resulting
    "princess seams" typically run vertically from the shoulder (or
    under the arm) over the bust point and down to the lower hem. This
    creates a long, slimming look, often seen in dresses with an
    "[A-line](/A-line_(clothing) "wikilink")" silhouette.
-   **Diagonal**: An asymmetrical waistline that runs across the body
    diagonally. Usually the highest point is below the natural
    waistline.
-   **Drop waist**: A low, horizontal waistline that usually falls near
    the level of the upper hips. Balances the upper and lower bodies,
    and adds to the visual impression of height by lengthening the
    torso. Common in [1920s silhouettes](/1920s_in_fashion "wikilink").
-   **Empire**: A high waistline that cuts horizontally across the body,
    just below the bust. This waistline gives a long, slender look and
    excellent fabric drape in the skirt and allows for short,
    inconspicuous shaping darts. This waistline was popular in [Jane
    Austen](/Jane_Austen "wikilink")'s
    [time](/1795–1820_in_fashion "wikilink"); see [Empire
    silhouette](/Empire_silhouette "wikilink").
-   **Raised**: A horizontal waistline that falls significantly above
    (>1 in.) the natural waist.
-   **Natural**: A horizontal waistline that falls at the natural waist
    and tends to make the wearer seem shorter by visually dividing the
    figure in half.
-   **V-shaped**: A generally flattering waistline, especially for
    figures with notable curvature. Also known as the **Basque
    waistline** or the **[Antebellum](/Antebellum_era "wikilink")
    waistline**.
-   **U-shaped**: A softer, less pronounced version of the Basque
    waistline.
-   **Inverted V-shaped**: Starts high in the center and drops at the
    sides and can fall as high as the bustline (e.g., paired with a low
    V neckline to give a "bowtie" look), but usually found near the hips
    (e.g., extending Bolero curves in the bodice).
-   **Inverted U-shaped**: A softer, less pronounced version of the
    inverted-V waistline, usually a gentle downwards curve.
