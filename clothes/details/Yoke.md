a shaped [pattern piece](/Pattern_(sewing) "wikilink") which forms part
of a garment, usually fitting around the neck and shoulders, or around
the hips to provide support for looser parts of the garment, such as a
gathered [skirt](/skirt "wikilink") or the body of a
[shirt](/shirt "wikilink").[1] Yoke construction was first seen in the
19th century.[2] Bodice yokes were first seen in the 1880s, whilst the
yoke skirt, a skirt suspended from a fitted hip yoke, was first seen in
1898.[3]
