**Angora hair** or **Angora fibre** refers to the downy coat produced by
the [Angora rabbit](Angora_rabbit "wikilink"). While the names of the
source animals are similar, Angora fibre is distinct from
[mohair](mohair "wikilink"), which comes from the [Angora
goat](Angora_goat "wikilink"). Angora fibre is also distinct from
[cashmere](cashmere_wool "wikilink"), which comes from the [cashmere
goat](cashmere_goat "wikilink"). Angora is known for its softness, thin
fibres, and what knitters refer to as a halo (fluffiness). It is also
known for its silky texture. It is much warmer and lighter than wool due
to the hollow core of the angora fibre. It also gives them their
characteristic floating feel.

Angora rabbits produce coats in a variety of colours, from white through
tan, gray, and brown to black. Good quality Angora fibre is around 12–16
micrometres in diameter, and can cost as much as
[US$](US_dollars "wikilink")10–16 per [ounce](ounce "wikilink") (35 to
50 cents/gram). It [felts](felt "wikilink") very easily, even on the
animal itself if it is not groomed frequently.

Yarns of 100% angora are typically used as accents. They have the most
halo and warmth, but can felt very easily through abrasion and humidity
and can be excessively warm in a finished garment. The fibre is normally
blended with [wool](wool "wikilink") to give the yarn elasticity, as
Angora fibre is not naturally elastic. The blend decreases the softness
and halo as well as the price of the finished object. Commercial
knitting yarns typically use 30–50% angora, in order to produce some
halo, warmth, and softness without the side effects of excessive
felting.

## The Angora rabbit

![](EnglishAngoraRabbit.jpg "fig:EnglishAngoraRabbit.jpg") There are
four different types of Angora recognized by
[ARBA](American_Rabbit_Breeders'_Association "wikilink"): English,
French, Satin and Giant. There are many other breeds, one of the more
common being German. Each breed produces different quality and quantity
of fibre, and has a different range of colours.

## Fur production

90% of Angora [fur](fur "wikilink") is produced in China, although
Europe, Chile and the United States also produce small quantities. In
China, there are more than 50 million Angora rabbits, growing
2,500–3,000 tonnes per year.[1] Harvesting occurs up to three times a
year (about every 4 months) and is collected by
[plucking](Plucking_(hair_removal) "wikilink") or
[shearing](Sheep_shearing "wikilink") of the moulting fur.

Most breeds of Angora rabbits moult with their natural growth cycle
about every four months. Many producers of the fibre
[pluck](Plucking_(hair_removal) "wikilink") the fur of these breeds.
Plucking is, in effect, pulling out the moulted fur. Plucking ensures a
minimum of [guard hair](guard_hair "wikilink"), and the fur is not as
matted when plucked as when it is collected from the rabbit's cage.
However, plucking a rabbit is time consuming, so some producers shear
the rabbit instead. While this results in slightly lower quality fleece,
as the guard hairs are included, it does take less time and results in
more fleece. Also, not all breeds of Angora moult, and if the rabbit
does not naturally moult, it cannot be plucked. German Angoras do not
moult.

The rabbits must be groomed at least once or twice a week to prevent the
fur from matting and felting. There is also a danger a rabbit will
ingest its own moulted fur; unlike a cat, a rabbit cannot easily be rid
of the build up.[2]

### Animal cruelty

In 2013 several clothing retailers suspended the sourcing of products
containing angora wool after video evidence surfaced of live rabbits
with their paws tied being plucked raw in Chinese fur farms. Major
retailers that banned angora products in response to welfare concerns
include [Hugo Boss](Hugo_Boss "wikilink"), [Gap
Inc.](Gap_Inc. "wikilink"), [Calvin Klein](Calvin_Klein "wikilink"),
[Tommy Hilfiger](Tommy_Hilfiger_Corporation "wikilink"),
[H&M](H&M "wikilink") and [Esprit](Esprit_Holdings "wikilink").[3]

In September 2016, French animal rights charity One Voice released
disturbing footage from six angora rabbit farms across France. The
videos depict the animals being pinned down with their front and hind
legs spread apart while workers pluck and rip the fur from their skin.
In the video, the rabbits scream and cry in pain as their fur is ripped
off, leaving them completely bare except for their heads.[4]

## Quality of wool

The premium first quality wool is taken from the back and upper sides of
the rabbit. This is usually the longest and cleanest fibre on the
rabbit. There should not be hay or vegetable matter in the fibre. Second
quality is from the neck and lower sides, and may have some vegetable
matter. Third quality is the buttocks and legs and any other areas that
easily felt and are of shorter length. Fourth quality is totally
unsalvageable, and consists of the larger [felted](felted "wikilink")
bits or stained fibre. Third and fourth quality are perfect for cutting
up for birds to use in lining their nests. With daily brushing, felting
of the fibre can be avoided, increasing the usable portion of fibre.

## Uses

Angora wool is commonly used in apparel such as sweaters and suitings,
knitting yarn, and [felting](felting "wikilink").
