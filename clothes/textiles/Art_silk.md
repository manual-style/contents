**Artificial silk** or **art silk** is any synthetic
[fiber](/fiber "wikilink") which resembles [silk](/silk "wikilink"), but
typically costs less to produce. Frequently, "artificial silk" is just a
[synonym](/synonym "wikilink") for [rayon](/rayon "wikilink").[1] When
made out of [bamboo viscose](/bamboo_viscose "wikilink") it is also
sometimes called **bamboo silk**.[2]

The first successful artificial silks were developed in the 1890s of
[cellulose fiber](/cellulose_fiber "wikilink") and marketed as *art
silk* or *[viscose](/viscose "wikilink")*, a trade name for a specific
manufacturer.[3] In 1924, the name of the fiber was officially changed
in the U.S. to rayon, although the term *viscose* continued to be used
in Europe. The material is commonly referred to in the industry as
*viscose rayon*.[4]

In 1931, [Henry Ford](/Henry_Ford "wikilink") hired chemists [Robert
Boyer](/Robert_Boyer_(chemist) "wikilink") and Frank Calvert to produce
artificial silk made with [soybean](/soybean "wikilink") fibers. They
succeeded in making a textile fiber of spun soy protein fibers, hardened
or tanned in a [formaldehyde](/formaldehyde "wikilink") bath, which was
given the name [Azlon](/Azlon "wikilink"). It was usable in the making
of suits, felt hats, and overcoats. Though pilot production of Azlon
reached per day in 1940, it never reached the commercial market;
[DuPont](/DuPont "wikilink")'s nylon was the winner in the quest to
produce artificial silk.

Although not sold under the name *art silk* initially,
[nylon](/nylon "wikilink"), the first synthetic fiber, was developed in
the [United States](/United_States "wikilink") in the late 1930s and
used as a replacement for [Japanese](/Japan "wikilink") silk during
[World War II](/World_War_II "wikilink"). Its properties are far
superior to rayon and silk when wet, and so it was used for many
military applications, such as [parachutes](/parachute "wikilink").
Although nylon is not a good substitute for silk fabric in appearance,
it is a successful functional alternative. DuPont's original plans for
nylon to become a cheaper and superior replacement for silk
[stockings](/stockings "wikilink")[5] were soon realized,[6] then
redirected for military use[7][8] just two years later during World War
II. Nylon became a prominent industrial fiber in a short time frame,
permanently replacing silk in many applications.

In the present day, imitation silk may be made with
[rayon](/rayon "wikilink"),[9] [mercerized
cotton](/mercerized_cotton "wikilink"),[10]
[polyester](/polyester "wikilink"),[11] a blend of these materials, or a
blend of rayon and silk.

Despite a generally similar appearance, genuine silk has unique features
that are distinguishable from artificial silk. However, in some cases
art silk can be passed off as real silk to unwary buyers. A number of
tests are available to determine a fabric's basic fiber makeup, some of
which can be performed prior to purchasing a fabric whose composition is
questionable. Tests include rubbing the pile in the hand, burning a
small piece of the fringe to smell the ash and smell the smoke, and
dissolving the pile by performing a chemical test.[12]

## Terms for artificial silk

-   "[Banglori](/Bangalore "wikilink") silk" is actually polyester woven
    to appear like silk.
