**Boiled wool** is a type of fabric primarily used in creating
[berets](/beret "wikilink"), [scarves](/scarf "wikilink"),
[vests](/vest "wikilink"), [cardigans](/cardigan_(sweater) "wikilink"),
[coats](/Coat_(clothing) "wikilink"), and [jackets](/jacket "wikilink").
To create this fabric, [knit](/knit "wikilink") [wool](/wool "wikilink")
or wool-blend fabrics are agitated with hot water in a process called
[fulling](/fulling "wikilink"). This process shrinks the fabric and
results in a dense [felted](/felted "wikilink") fabric that resists
fraying and further shrinkage.[1]

## Origins

Boiled wool is a type of [felted](/felted "wikilink") wool, and is
similar to [non-woven](/non-woven "wikilink") wool
[felt](/felt "wikilink"). These processes date at least as far back as
the [Middle Ages](/Middle_Ages "wikilink"). The word *felt* itself comes
from West Germanic *feltaz*.[2] Boiled/felted wool is characteristic of
the traditional textiles of South America and [Tyrolean
Austria](/Tyrol_(state) "wikilink"). It is produced industrially around
the world.

## Process

Boiled wool fabric is created commercially by first
[knitting](/knitting "wikilink") wool yarns to create a fabric of
uniform thickness. The yarns and fabric may either be dyed or left
natural, and the fabric may include designs or embellishments. After
knitting, the fabric is [fulled](/fulling "wikilink") by boiling and
agitating in hot water and an [alkaline](/Base_(chemistry) "wikilink")
solution like soap. The agitation causes the scaly surface of wool
fibers to stick together, producing a felted fabric. The result is a
tighter and more dense material that is up to 50% smaller in all
directions compared to the pre-felted fabric.[3] Boiled wool is warm,
durable, and resistant to water and wind.[4]

The general process of felting can be used to process
[non-woven](/non-woven "wikilink") fibers into pieces of
[felt](/felt "wikilink") used in industry, medical applications, and for
crafts and costumes. This can be performed using a variety of fibers,
including wool blends, rayon, polyester, and acrylic.
