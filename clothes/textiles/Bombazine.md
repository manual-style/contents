**Bombazine**, or **bombasine**, is a [fabric](/cloth "wikilink")
originally made of [silk](/silk "wikilink") or silk and
[wool](/wool "wikilink"), and now also made of
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink") and wool or of wool alone. Quality
bombazine is made with a silk [warp](/Warp_(weaving) "wikilink") and a
[worsted](/worsted "wikilink") [weft](/weft "wikilink"). It is
[twilled](/twill "wikilink") or [corded](/Corduroy "wikilink") and used
for dress-material. Black bombazine was once used largely for
[mourning](/mourning "wikilink") wear, but the material had gone out of
fashion by the beginning of the 20th century.[1]

The word is derived from the obsolete
[French](/French_language "wikilink") *bombasin*, applied originally to
silk but afterwards to tree-silk or cotton. Bombazine is said to have
been made in [England](/England "wikilink") in [Elizabeth
I's](/Elizabeth_I_of_England "wikilink") reign, and early in the 19th
century it was largely made at [Norwich](/Norwich "wikilink").[2]
