[thumb\|Buckram is available in many
colors.](/Image:Buckram_variety.jpg "wikilink") **Buckram** is a stiff
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink") (occasionally [linen](/linen "wikilink") or
horse hair) cloth with a loose weave, often
[muslin](/muslin "wikilink"). The fabric is soaked in a
[sizing](/sizing "wikilink") agent such as wheat starch paste, glue
(such as [PVA glue](/Polyvinyl_acetate "wikilink")), or
[pyroxylin](/pyroxylin "wikilink") (gelatinized nitrocellulose,
developed around 1910), then dried. When rewetted or warmed, it can be
shaped to create durable firm fabric for book covers, hats, and elements
of clothing.

In the [Middle Ages](/Middle_Ages "wikilink"), "bokeram", as it was
known then, was fine cotton cloth, not stiff. The etymology of the term
is uncertain; the commonly mentioned derivation from
[Bokhara](/Bokhara "wikilink")[1] is, according to the *[Oxford English
Dictionary](/Oxford_English_Dictionary "wikilink")*, uncertain.[2]

## Use in bookbinding

In bookbinding, buckram has several attractive qualities. In addition to
being highly durable, buckram does not allow the bookbinder's paste to
seep through and cause discoloration or stains on the book's front and
back covers.[3]

In bookbinding, pyroxylin-impregnated fabrics are considered superior to
starch-filled fabrics because their surfaces are more water resistant,
they are more resistant to insects and fungi, and they are generally
stronger. They wear well and are particularly suitable for use in
library binding where many people will be repeatedly handling the same
books. Pyroxylin also allows for unique decorative effects on book
covers. They, too, are water repellant and immune to insect attack and
fungi, but they do not wear as well as starch impregnated cloths because
of cracking at the joints and occasional peeling of the coating.

## Use in millinery

[Millinery](/Hatmaking "wikilink") buckram is different from
[bookbinding](/bookbinding "wikilink") buckram. The former is
impregnated with a starch which allows it to be softened in water,
pulled over a [hat block](/hat_block "wikilink"), and left to dry into a
hard shape.[4] Millinery buckram comes in many weights, including
lightweight or baby buckram (often used for children's and dolls'
hats),[5] single-ply buckram, and double buckram (also known as
"theatrical buckram" or "crown buckram").[6]
