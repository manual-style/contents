[Glasgow](Glasgow "wikilink"), Scotland\]\] **Buckskin** is the soft,
pliable, porous preserved hide of an animal – usually
[deer](deer "wikilink") – [tanned](Tanning_(leather) "wikilink") in the
same way as deerskin clothing worn by [Native
Americans](Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "wikilink"). Some leather
sold as "buckskin" may now be [sheepskin](sheepskin "wikilink") tanned
with modern chromate tanning chemicals and dyed to resemble real
buckskin.

Buckskin is preserved with a dressing of lubricant, physically
manipulated to make it soft and pliable, and usually smoked with
woodsmoke. Smoking gives buckskin its typical dark honey color, and is
highly recommended. Smoking prevents the tanned hide from becoming stiff
if it gets wet, and deters insects from eating it as well. Unsmoked
buckskin is lighter, even white, in color.

[Clothing](Clothing "wikilink") made of buckskin is referred to as
[buckskins](buckskins "wikilink").
