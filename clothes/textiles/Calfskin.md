**Calfskin** or **calf leather** is a [leather](/leather "wikilink") or
[membrane](/Biological_membrane "wikilink") produced from the hide of a
[calf](/calf "wikilink"), or juvenile [domestic
cattle](/domestic_cattle "wikilink"). Calfskin is particularly valuable
because of its softness and fine grain, as well as durability. It is
commonly used for high-quality [clothing](/clothing "wikilink"), shoes,
wallets, and similar products, as well as traditional leather
[bookbindings](/bookbinding "wikilink"). In these contexts, just "calf"
is commonly used. Fine calfskin is one of the skins used for
[vellum](/vellum "wikilink") and [parchment](/parchment "wikilink")
manuscripts.

In Spanish, the word is *novillo*, referring to leather from animals
less than three years old. Chickenskin, despite its name, is a form of
calfskin made using the skin of unborn calves.[1]

In fashion, soft finished calfskin is sometimes described as*veau
velours* (French for "velvet calf").[2]
