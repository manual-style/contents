**Coolmax** is the [brand name](/brand_name "wikilink") for a series of
[polyester](/polyester "wikilink") fabrics developed and marketed by
[Invista](/Invista "wikilink") (formerly Dupont Textiles and Interiors).

Coolmax is marketed as "moisture-wicking" and "breathable". As a
polyester, it is moderately hydrophobic, so it absorbs little fluid and
dries relatively quickly (compared to absorbent fibers such as
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink")). The cross-section is non-round,
increasing surface area by an estimated 20% (over round fibers) in order
to produce a wicking effect via [capillary
action](/capillary_action "wikilink").[1][2]

Invista makes extensive use of [co-branding](/co-branding "wikilink") in
their marketing of Coolmax and other clothing materials, partnering with
their customers to increase awareness of their product among end
consumers.[3]

Like other polyester fabrics, Coolmax is flammable and has a relatively
low melting point (\~255 Â°C), giving clothes made from it a tendency to
melt and fuse to the wearer's skin when exposed to high heat. This has
led to Coolmax and other polyesters (along with acrylic and rayon) being
restricted or banned in certain high-fire-risk applications, such as
firefighting and front-line combat.[4][5]
