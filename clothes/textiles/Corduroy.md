[thumb\|Cotton corduroy](/Image:Mansestr.jpg "wikilink") [thumb\|Cotton
and woolen corduroy](/Image:Cord_1.jpg "wikilink") **Corduroy** is a
[textile](/textile "wikilink") with a distinct pattern, a "cord" or
wale. Modern corduroy is most commonly composed of
[tufted](/tufting "wikilink") cords, sometimes exhibiting a channel
(bare to the base fabric) between the tufts. Both velvet and corduroy
derive from [fustian](/fustian "wikilink") fabric.[1] The fabric looks
as if it is made from multiple cords laid parallel to each other and
then stitched together. The word *corduroy* is from *cord* and *duroy*,
a coarse woollen cloth made in England in the 18th century.[2] The
interpretation of the word as *corde du roi* (from French, *the cord of
the King*) is a [false etymology](/false_etymology "wikilink").[3][4]

As a [fabric](/Textile "wikilink"), corduroy is considered a durable
cloth. Corduroy is found in the construction of
[trousers](/trousers "wikilink"), [jackets](/jackets "wikilink") and
[shirts](/shirts "wikilink"). The width of the cord is commonly referred
to as the size of the "wale" (i.e. the number of ridges per inch).[5]
The lower the "wale" number, the thicker the width of the wale (e.g.,
4-wale is much thicker than 11-wale). Corduroyâ€™s wale count per inch can
vary from 1.5 to 21, although the traditional standard falls somewhere
between 10 and 12. Wide wale is more commonly used in trousers and
furniture upholstery (primarily couches); medium, narrow, and fine wale
fabrics are usually found in garments worn above the waist.

Corduroy is made by weaving extra sets of fibre into the base fabric to
form vertical ridges called wales. The wales are built so that clear
lines can be seen when they are cut into pile.

The primary types of corduroy are:

-   Standard wale: 11 wales/inch, and available in many colours
-   Pincord/pinwale/needlecord: Pincord is the finest cord around with a
    count at the upper end of the spectrum (above 16)
-   Pigment dyed/printed corduroy: The process of colouring or printing
    corduroy with pigment dyes. The dye is applied to the surface of the
    fabric, then the garment is cut and sewn. When washed during the
    final phase of the manufacturing process, the pigment dye washes out
    in an irregular way, creating a vintage look. The colour of each
    garment becomes softer with each washing, and there is a subtle
    colour variation from one to the next. No two are alike.

## Other names

Other names are often used for corduroy. Alternative names include:
**corded velveteen**, **elephant cord** (the thick-stripes version),
**pin cord**, **Manchester cloth** and **cords**.[6]

In continental Europe, corduroy is known as "Cord", "rib cord" or "rib
velvet" - in parts of Europe such as Germany, Czechia, Holland and
Belgium it used to be simply known as "Manchester" - that still remains
the current name for corduroy in Swedish.

Corduroy is a material traditionally used in making [British country
clothing](/British_country_clothing "wikilink"), even though its origin
lies among items worn by townspeople in industrial areas. Although
corduroy has existed for a long time and was used in Europe since the
18th century, only in the 20th century did it become global - notably
expanding in popularity during the 1970s.
