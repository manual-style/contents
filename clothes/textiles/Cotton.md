**Cotton** is a soft, fluffy [staple](Staple_(textiles) "wikilink")
[fiber](fiber "wikilink") that grows in a [boll](wikt:boll "wikilink"),
or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus
*[Gossypium](Gossypium "wikilink")* in the mallow family
[Malvaceae](Malvaceae "wikilink"). The fiber is almost pure
[cellulose](cellulose "wikilink"). Under natural conditions, the cotton
bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.

The plant is a [shrub](shrub "wikilink") native to tropical and
subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa,
Egypt and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found
in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa.[1] Cotton was independently
domesticated in the Old and New Worlds.

The fiber is most often [spun](Spinning_(textiles) "wikilink") into
[yarn](yarn "wikilink") or thread and used to make a soft,
[breathable](breathable "wikilink") [textile](textile "wikilink"). The
use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times;
fragments of cotton fabric dated to the fifth millennium BCE have been
found in the [Indus Valley
Civilization](Indus_Valley_Civilization "wikilink"), as well as fabric
remnants dated back to 6000 BCE in [Peru](Peru "wikilink"). Although
cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the [cotton
gin](cotton_gin "wikilink") that lowered the cost of production that led
to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used [natural
fiber](natural_fiber "wikilink") cloth in clothing today.

Current estimates for world production are about 25 million
[tonnes](tonne "wikilink") or 110 million bales annually, accounting for
2.5% of the world's arable land. China is the world's largest producer
of cotton, but most of this is used domestically. The United States has
been the largest exporter for many years.[2] In the United States,
cotton is usually measured in bales, which measure approximately and
weigh .[3]

## Types

There are four commercially grown species of cotton, all domesticated in
antiquity:

-   *[Gossypium hirsutum](Gossypium_hirsutum "wikilink")* – upland
    cotton, native to [Central America](Central_America "wikilink"),
    Mexico, the Caribbean and southern Florida (90% of world production)
-   *[Gossypium barbadense](Gossypium_barbadense "wikilink")* – known as
    extra-long staple cotton, native to tropical South America (8% of
    world production)
-   *[Gossypium arboreum](Gossypium_arboreum "wikilink")* – tree cotton,
    native to India and Pakistan (less than 2%)
-   *[Gossypium herbaceum](Gossypium_herbaceum "wikilink")* – Levant
    cotton, native to southern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (less
    than 2%)

The two New World cotton species account for the vast majority of modern
cotton production, but the two Old World species were widely used before
the 1900s. While cotton fibers occur naturally in colors of white,
brown, pink and green, fears of contaminating the genetics of white
cotton have led many cotton-growing locations to ban the growing of
colored cotton varieties.

## Etymology

The word "cotton" has [Arabic
origins](List_of_English_words_of_Arabic_origin "wikilink"), derived
from the [Arabic](Arabic "wikilink") word قطن (*qutn* or *qutun*). This
was the usual word for cotton in [medieval
Arabic](Classical_Arabic "wikilink").[4] The word entered the [Romance
languages](Romance_languages "wikilink") in the mid-12th century,[5] and
English a century later. Cotton fabric was known to the ancient
[Romans](Roman_Empire "wikilink") as an import but cotton was rare in
the [Romance-speaking lands](Romance-speaking_Europe "wikilink") until
imports from the Arabic-speaking lands in the later medieval era at
transformatively lower prices.[6][7]

## History

### Early history

#### South Asia

![](Mehrgarh_pakistan_rel96.JPG "fig:Mehrgarh_pakistan_rel96.JPG") The
earliest evidence of the use of cotton in the [Old
world](Old_world "wikilink"), dated to 5500 BCE and preserved in copper
beads, has been found at the [Neolithic](Neolithic "wikilink") site of
[Mehrgarh](Mehrgarh "wikilink"), at the foot of the [Bolan
Pass](Bolan_Pass "wikilink") in [Balochistan](Balochistan "wikilink"),
[Pakistan](Pakistan "wikilink").[8][9][10]

#### Americas

Cotton bolls discovered in a cave near
[Tehuacán](Tehuacán,_Puebla "wikilink"), [Mexico](Mexico "wikilink"),
have been dated to as early as 5500 BC, but this date has been
challenged.[11] More securely dated is the domestication of [Gossypium
hirsutum](Gossypium_hirsutum "wikilink") in Mexico between around 3400
and 2300 BC.[12]

In [Peru](Peru "wikilink"), cultivation of the indigenous cotton species
*[Gossypium barbadense](Gossypium_barbadense "wikilink")* has been
dated, from a find in Ancon, to c. 4200 BC,[13] and was the backbone of
the development of coastal cultures such as the [Norte
Chico](Norte_Chico_civilization "wikilink"),
[Moche](Moche_(culture) "wikilink"), and
[Nazca](Nazca_culture "wikilink"). Cotton was grown upriver, made into
nets, and traded with fishing villages along the coast for large
supplies of fish. The Spanish who came to Mexico and Peru in the early
16th century found the people growing cotton and wearing clothing made
of it.

#### Arabia

The Greeks and the Arabs were not familiar with cotton until the [Wars
of Alexander the Great](Wars_of_Alexander_the_Great "wikilink"), as his
contemporary [Megasthenes](Megasthenes "wikilink") told [Seleucus I
Nicator](Seleucus_I_Nicator "wikilink") of "there being trees on which
wool grows" in "Indica". This may be a reference to "tree cotton",
[Gossypium arboreum](Gossypium_arboreum "wikilink"), which is a native
of the Indian subcontinent.

According to the *[Columbia
Encyclopedia](Columbia_Encyclopedia "wikilink")*:[14]

#### Iran

In Iran ([Persia](Persia "wikilink")), the history of cotton dates back
to the [Achaemenid](Achaemenid "wikilink") era (5th century BC);
however, there are few sources about the planting of cotton in
pre-Islamic Iran. The planting of cotton was common in
[Merv](Merv "wikilink"), [Ray](Ray,_Iran "wikilink") and
[Pars](Fārs_Province "wikilink") of Iran. In [Persian
poets](Persian_poetry "wikilink")' poems, especially
[Ferdowsi](Ferdowsi "wikilink")'s [Shahname](Shahname "wikilink"), there
are references to cotton ("panbe" in
[Persian](Persian_language "wikilink")). [Marco
Polo](Marco_Polo "wikilink") (13th century) refers to the major products
of Persia, including cotton. [John Chardin](John_Chardin "wikilink"), a
French traveler of the 17th century who visited [Safavid
Persia](Safavid_dynasty "wikilink"), spoke approvingly of the vast
cotton farms of Persia.[15]

#### China

During the [Han dynasty](Han_dynasty "wikilink") (207 BC - 220 AD),
cotton was grown by Chinese peoples in the southern Chinese province of
[Yunnan](Yunnan "wikilink").[16]

### Middle Ages

#### Eastern world

[Egyptians](Egypt "wikilink") grew and spun cotton in the first seven
centuries of the Christian era.[17]

Handheld roller [cotton gins](cotton_gin "wikilink") had been used in
India since the 6th century, and was then introduced to other countries
from there.[18] Between the 12th and 14th centuries, dual-roller gins
appeared in India and China. The Indian version of the dual-roller gin
was prevalent throughout the Mediterranean cotton trade by the 16th
century. This mechanical device was, in some areas, driven by water
power.[19]

The earliest clear illustrations of the [spinning
wheel](spinning_wheel "wikilink") come from the [Islamic
world](Muslim_world "wikilink") in the eleventh century.[20] The
earliest unambiguous reference to a spinning wheel in India is dated to
1350, suggesting that the spinning wheel was likely introduced from Iran
to India during the [Delhi Sultanate](Delhi_Sultanate "wikilink").[21]

#### Europe

![](Mandeville_cotton.jpg "fig:Mandeville_cotton.jpg") in the 14th
century\]\] During the late medieval period, cotton became known as an
imported fiber in northern Europe, without any knowledge of how it was
derived, other than that it was a plant. Because
[Herodotus](Herodotus "wikilink") had written in his
*[Histories](Histories_(Herodotus) "wikilink")*, Book III, 106, that in
India trees grew in the wild producing wool, it was assumed that the
plant was a tree, rather than a shrub. This aspect is retained in the
name for cotton in several Germanic languages, such as German
*[Baumwolle](wikt:Baumwolle "wikilink")*, which translates as "tree
wool" (*Baum* means "tree"; *Wolle* means "wool"). Noting its
similarities to wool, people in the region could only imagine that
cotton must be produced by plant-borne sheep. [John
Mandeville](John_Mandeville "wikilink"), writing in 1350, stated as fact
that "There grew there \[India\] a wonderful tree which bore tiny lambs
on the endes of its branches. These branches were so pliable that they
bent down to allow the lambs to feed when they are hungry." (See
[Vegetable Lamb of
Tartary](Vegetable_Lamb_of_Tartary "wikilink").)![](Vegetable_lamb_(Lee,_1887).jpg "fig:Vegetable_lamb_(Lee,_1887).jpg")\]\]
Cotton manufacture was introduced to Europe during the [Muslim conquest
of the Iberian Peninsula](Umayyad_conquest_of_Hispania "wikilink") [and
Sicily](Muslim_conquest_of_Sicily "wikilink"). The knowledge of cotton
weaving was spread to northern Italy in the 12th century, when [Sicily
was conquered by the
Normans](Norman_conquest_of_southern_Italy "wikilink"), and consequently
to the rest of Europe. The [spinning wheel](spinning_wheel "wikilink"),
introduced to Europe circa 1350, improved the speed of cotton
spinning.[22] By the 15th century, [Venice](Venice "wikilink"),
[Antwerp](Antwerp "wikilink"), and [Haarlem](Haarlem "wikilink") were
important ports for cotton trade, and the sale and transportation of
cotton fabrics had become very profitable.[23]

### Early modern period

#### Mughal India

![](Renaldis_muslin_woman.jpg "fig:Renaldis_muslin_woman.jpg") clad in
fine [Bengali muslin](Muslin_trade_in_Bengal "wikilink"), 18th
century.\]\] Under the [Mughal Empire](Mughal_Empire "wikilink"), which
ruled in the [Indian subcontinent](Indian_subcontinent "wikilink") from
the early 16th century to the early 18th century, Indian cotton
production increased, in terms of both raw cotton and cotton textiles.
The Mughals introduced [agrarian reforms](agrarian_reform "wikilink")
such as a new revenue system that was biased in favour of higher value
[cash crops](cash_crops "wikilink") such as cotton and
[indigo](indigo "wikilink"), providing state incentives to grow cash
crops, in addition to rising market demand.[24]

The largest [manufacturing](manufacturing "wikilink") industry in the
Mughal Empire was cotton [textile
manufacturing](textile_manufacturing "wikilink"), which included the
production of [piece goods](wikt:piece_goods "wikilink"),
[calicos](calico "wikilink"), and [muslins](muslin "wikilink"),
available unbleached and in a variety of colours. The cotton [textile
industry](textile_industry "wikilink") was responsible for a large part
of the empire's international trade.[25] India had a 25% share of the
global textile trade in the early 18th century.[26] Indian cotton
[textiles](textile "wikilink") were the most important [manufactured
goods](manufactured_goods "wikilink") in world trade in the 18th
century, consumed across the world from the
[Americas](Americas "wikilink") to [Japan](Japan "wikilink").[27] The
most important center of cotton production was the [Bengal
Subah](Bengal_Subah "wikilink") province, particularly around its
capital city of [Dhaka](Dhaka "wikilink").[28]

The [worm gear](worm_gear "wikilink") roller [cotton
gin](cotton_gin "wikilink"), which was invented in India during the
early [Delhi Sultanate](Delhi_Sultanate "wikilink") era of the 13th–14th
centuries, came into use in the Mughal Empire some time around the 16th
century,[29] and is still used in India through to the present day.[30]
Another innovation, the incorporation of the
[crank](Crank_(mechanism) "wikilink") handle in the cotton gin, first
appeared in India some time during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early
Mughal Empire.[31] The production of cotton, which may have largely been
spun in the villages and then taken to towns in the form of yarn to be
woven into cloth textiles, was advanced by the diffusion of the
[spinning wheel](spinning_wheel "wikilink") across India shortly before
the Mughal era, lowering the costs of yarn and helping to increase
demand for cotton. The diffusion of the spinning wheel, and the
incorporation of the worm gear and crank handle into the roller cotton
gin, led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production during the
Mughal era.[32]

It was reported that, with an Indian cotton gin, which is half machine
and half tool, one man and one woman could clean 28 pounds of cotton per
day. With a modified Forbes version, one man and a boy could produce 250
pounds per day. If oxen were used to power 16 of these machines, and a
few people's labour was used to feed them, they could produce as much
work as 750 people did formerly.[33]

#### Egypt

In the early 19th century, a Frenchman named M. Jumel proposed to the
great ruler of [Egypt](Egypt "wikilink"), [Mohamed Ali
Pasha](Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt "wikilink"), that he could earn a
substantial income by growing an extra-long staple Maho (*[Gossypium
barbadense](Gossypium_barbadense "wikilink")*) cotton, in [Lower
Egypt](Lower_Egypt "wikilink"), for the French market. Mohamed Ali Pasha
accepted the proposition and granted himself the monopoly on the sale
and export of cotton in Egypt; and later dictated cotton should be grown
in preference to other crops.

[Egypt under Muhammad Ali](Egypt_under_Muhammad_Ali "wikilink") in the
early 19th century had the fifth most productive cotton industry in the
world, in terms of the number of
[spindles](Spindle_(textiles) "wikilink") per capita.[34] The industry
was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy
sources, such as [animal power](animal_power "wikilink"), [water
wheels](water_wheel "wikilink"), and [windmills](windmill "wikilink"),
which were also the principal energy sources in Western Europe up until
around 1870.[35] It was under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century
that [steam engines](steam_engine "wikilink") were introduced to the
Egyptian cotton industry.[36]

By the time of the American Civil war annual exports had reached $16
million (120,000 bales), which rose to $56 million by 1864, primarily
due to the loss of the Confederate supply on the world market. Exports
continued to grow even after the reintroduction of US cotton, produced
now by a paid workforce, and Egyptian exports reached 1.2 million bales
a year by 1903.

### Britain

#### East India Company

The [English East India Company](English_East_India_Company "wikilink")
(EIC) introduced the Britain to cheap
[calico](Calico_(textile) "wikilink") and [chintz](chintz "wikilink")
cloth on the restoration of the monarchy in the 1660s. Initially
imported as a novelty side line, from its spice trading posts in Asia,
the cheap colourful cloth proved popular and overtook the EIC's spice
trade by value in the late 17th century. The EIC embraced the demand,
particularly for [calico](Calico_(textile) "wikilink"), by expanding its
factories in Asia and producing and importing cloth in bulk, creating
competition for domestic woollen and linen textile producers. The
impacted weavers, spinners, dyers, shepherds and farmers objected and
the calico question became one of the major issues of National politics
between the 1680s and the 1730s. Parliament began to see a decline in
domestic textile sales, and an increase in imported textiles from places
like [China](China "wikilink") and [India](India "wikilink"). Seeing the
East India Company and their textile importation as a threat to domestic
textile businesses, Parliament passed the 1700 Calico Act, blocking the
importation of cotton cloth. As there was no punishment for continuing
to sell cotton cloth, smuggling of the popular material became
commonplace. In 1721, dissatisfied with the results of the first act,
Parliament passed a stricter addition, this time prohibiting the sale of
most cottons, imported and domestic (exempting only thread
[Fustian](Fustian "wikilink") and raw cotton). The exemption of raw
cotton from the prohibition initially saw 2 thousand bales of cotton
imported annually, to become the basis of a new indigenous industry,
initially producing [Fustian](Fustian "wikilink") for the domestic
market, though more importantly triggering the development of a series
of mechanised spinning and weaving technologies, to process the
material. This mechanised production was concentrated in new [cotton
mills](cotton_mill "wikilink"), which slowly expanded till by the
beginning of the 1770s seven thousand bales of cotton were imported
annually, and pressure was put on Parliament, by the new mill owners, to
remove the prohibition on the production and sale of pure cotton cloth,
as they could easily compete with anything the EIC could import.

The acts were repealed in 1774, triggering a wave of investment in mill
based cotton spinning and production, doubling the demand for raw cotton
within a couple of years, and doubling it again every decade, into the
1840s[37]

Indian cotton textiles, particularly those from
[Bengal](Bengal_Subah "wikilink"), continued to maintain a competitive
advantage up until the 19th century. In order to compete with India,
Britain invested in labour-saving technical progress, while implementing
[protectionist](protectionist "wikilink") policies such as bans and
[tariffs](tariff "wikilink") to restrict Indian imports.[38] At the same
time, the East India Company's [rule in
India](Company_rule_in_India "wikilink") contributed to its
[deindustrialization](deindustrialization "wikilink"), opening up a new
market for British goods,[39] while the capital amassed from Bengal
after its [1757 conquest](Battle_of_Plassey "wikilink") was used to
invest in British industries such as textile manufacturing and greatly
increase British wealth.[40][41] British colonization also forced open
the large Indian market to British goods, which could be sold in India
without tariffs or [duties](Duty_(economics) "wikilink"), compared to
local Indian producers who were heavily [taxed](tax "wikilink"), while
raw cotton was imported from India without tariffs to British factories
which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton, giving Britain a
monopoly over India's large market and cotton resources.[42][43][44]
India served as both a significant supplier of raw goods to British
manufacturers and a large [captive market](captive_market "wikilink")
for British manufactured goods.[45] Britain eventually surpassed India
as the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th
century.[46]

India's cotton-processing sector changed during EIC expansion in India
in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. From focusing on supplying
the British market to supplying East Asia with raw cotton. As the
Artisan produced textiles were no longer competitive with those produced
Industrially, and Europe preferring the cheaper slave produced, long
staple American, and Egyptian cottons, for its own materials.

#### Industrial Revolution

The advent of the [Industrial
Revolution](Industrial_Revolution "wikilink") in Britain provided a
great boost to cotton manufacture, as textiles emerged as Britain's
leading export. In 1738, [Lewis Paul](Lewis_Paul "wikilink") and [John
Wyatt](John_Wyatt_(inventor) "wikilink"), of
[Birmingham](Birmingham "wikilink"), England, patented the roller
spinning machine, as well as the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing
cotton to a more even thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled
at different speeds. Later, the invention of the [James
Hargreaves](James_Hargreaves "wikilink")' [spinning
jenny](spinning_jenny "wikilink") in 1764, [Richard
Arkwright](Richard_Arkwright "wikilink")'s [spinning
frame](spinning_frame "wikilink") in 1769 and [Samuel
Crompton](Samuel_Crompton "wikilink")'s [spinning
mule](spinning_mule "wikilink") in 1775 enabled British spinners to
produce cotton yarn at much higher rates. From the late 18th century on,
the British city of [Manchester](Manchester "wikilink") acquired the
nickname *"[Cottonopolis](Cottonopolis "wikilink")"* due to the cotton
industry's omnipresence within the city, and Manchester's role as the
heart of the global cotton trade.

Production capacity in Britain and the United States was improved by the
invention of the modern [cotton gin](cotton_gin "wikilink") by the
American [Eli Whitney](Eli_Whitney "wikilink") in 1793. Before the
development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the
seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s, a number of crude ginning
machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton
required over 600 hours of human labor,[47] making large-scale
production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of
humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes
design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although
Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a
prior design from [Henry Odgen Holmes](Henry_Odgen_Holmes "wikilink"),
for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796.[48] Improving technology and
increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a
commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased
from [colonial](British_Empire "wikilink")
[plantations](plantations "wikilink"), processed into cotton cloth in
the mills of [Lancashire](Lancashire "wikilink"), and then exported on
British ships to captive colonial markets in [West
Africa](British_West_Africa "wikilink"),
[India](British_Raj "wikilink"), and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).

By the 1840s, India was no longer capable of supplying the vast
quantities of cotton fibers needed by mechanized British factories,
while shipping bulky, low-price cotton from India to Britain was
time-consuming and expensive. This, coupled with the emergence of
American cotton as a superior type (due to the longer, stronger fibers
of the two domesticated Native American species, *[Gossypium
hirsutum](Gossypium_hirsutum "wikilink")* and *[Gossypium
barbadense](Gossypium_barbadense "wikilink")*), encouraged British
traders to purchase cotton from [plantations in the United
States](Plantations_in_the_American_South "wikilink") and
[plantations](plantations "wikilink") in the
[Caribbean](Caribbean "wikilink"). By the mid-19th century, "[King
Cotton](King_Cotton "wikilink")" had become the backbone of the
[southern American](antebellum_South "wikilink") economy. In the United
States, cultivating and harvesting cotton became the leading occupation
of [slaves](Slavery_in_the_United_States "wikilink").

During the [American Civil War](American_Civil_War "wikilink"), American
cotton exports slumped due to a
[Union](Union_(American_Civil_War) "wikilink")
[blockade](blockade "wikilink") on
[Southern](Confederate_States_of_America "wikilink")
[ports](port "wikilink"), and also because of a strategic decision by
the [Confederate](Confederate_States_of_America "wikilink") government
to cut exports, hoping to force Britain to recognize the Confederacy or
enter the war. This prompted the main purchasers of cotton,
[Britain](United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "wikilink") and
[France](France "wikilink"), to turn to [Egyptian](Egypt "wikilink")
cotton. British and French traders invested heavily in cotton
plantations. The Egyptian government of [Viceroy
Isma'il](Isma'il_Pasha "wikilink") took out substantial loans from
European bankers and stock exchanges. After the American Civil War ended
in 1865, British and French traders abandoned [Egyptian
cotton](Egyptian_cotton "wikilink") and returned to cheap American
exports, sending Egypt into a deficit spiral that led to the country
declaring [bankruptcy](bankruptcy "wikilink") in 1876, a key factor
behind Egypt's [occupation by the British Empire in
1882](History_of_Egypt_under_the_British "wikilink").

During this time, cotton cultivation in the [British
Empire](British_Empire "wikilink"), especially Australia and India,
greatly increased to replace the lost production of the American South.
Through tariffs and other restrictions, the British government
discouraged the production of cotton cloth in India; rather, the raw
fiber was sent to England for processing. The Indian [Mahatma
Gandhi](Gandhi,_Mohandas_K. "wikilink") described the process:

1.  English people buy Indian cotton in the field, picked by Indian
    labor at seven cents a day, through an optional monopoly.
2.  This cotton is shipped on British ships, a three-week journey across
    the Indian Ocean, down the Red Sea, across the Mediterranean,
    through Gibraltar, across the Bay of Biscay and the Atlantic Ocean
    to London. One hundred per cent profit on this freight is regarded
    as small.
3.  The cotton is turned into cloth in Lancashire. You pay shilling
    wages instead of Indian pennies to your workers. The English worker
    not only has the advantage of better wages, but the steel companies
    of England get the profit of building the factories and machines.
    Wages; profits; all these are spent in England.
4.  The finished product is sent back to India at European shipping
    rates, once again on British ships. The captains, officers, sailors
    of these ships, whose wages must be paid, are English. The only
    Indians who profit are a few lascars who do the dirty work on the
    boats for a few cents a day.
5.  The cloth is finally sold back to the kings and landlords of India
    who got the money to buy this expensive cloth out of the poor
    peasants of India who worked at seven cents a day.[49]

### United States

farming cotton under the [trusty
system](Trusty_system_(prison) "wikilink") in [Parchman
Farm](Parchman_Farm "wikilink"), [Mississippi](Mississippi "wikilink"),
1911\]\] In the United States, Southern cotton provided capital for the
continuing development of the North. The cotton was largely produced
through the labor of enslaved African Americans. It enriched both the
Southern landowners and the Northern merchants. Much of the Southern
cotton was trans-shipped through northern [ports](ports "wikilink"). In
this era the slogan "[Cotton is king](King_Cotton "wikilink")"
characterized the attitude of the South toward this
[monocrop](monocrop "wikilink").

Cotton remained a key crop in the Southern economy after
[emancipation](Emancipation_Proclamation "wikilink") and the end of the
Civil War in 1865. Across the South,
[sharecropping](sharecropping "wikilink") evolved, in which landless
farmers worked land owned by others in return for a share of the
profits. Some farmers rented the land and bore the production costs
themselves. Until mechanical [cotton pickers](cotton_picker "wikilink")
were developed, cotton farmers needed additional labor to hand-pick
cotton. Picking cotton was a source of income for families across the
South. Rural and small town school systems had split vacations so
children could work in the fields during "cotton-picking."

It was not until the 1950s that reliable harvesting machinery was
introduced (prior to this, cotton-harvesting machinery had been too
clumsy to pick cotton without shredding the fibers). During the first
half of the 20th century, employment in the cotton industry fell, as
machines began to replace laborers and the South's rural labor force
dwindled during the [World Wars](World_War "wikilink").

Cotton remains a major export of the [southern United
States](southern_United_States "wikilink"), and a majority of the
world's annual cotton crop is of the long-staple American variety.[50]

### The Moon

China's [Chang'e 4](Chang'e_4 "wikilink") brought cotton seeds to the
[Moon's far side](Far_side_of_the_Moon "wikilink"). On January 15, 2019,
China announced a cotton seed sprouted, the first "truly otherworldly
plant in history." Inside the [Von Kármán
Crater](Von_Kármán_(Martian_crater) "wikilink"), the capsule and seeds
sit inside the Chang'e 4 lander.[51]

Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long
[frost](frost "wikilink")-free period, plenty of sunshine, and a
moderate rainfall, usually from . [Soils](Soil "wikilink") usually need
to be fairly heavy, although the level of
[nutrients](nutrient "wikilink") does not need to be exceptional. In
general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and
subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large
proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less
rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop
for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding
autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to
help control pests.[52] Planting time in spring in the Northern
hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of
June. The area of the United States known as the [South
Plains](South_Plains "wikilink") is the largest contiguous
cotton-growing region in the world. While dryland (non-irrigated) cotton
is successfully grown in this region, consistent yields are only
produced with heavy reliance on [irrigation](irrigation "wikilink")
water drawn from the [Ogallala Aquifer](Ogallala_Aquifer "wikilink").
Since cotton is somewhat salt and drought tolerant, this makes it an
attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions. As [water
resources](water_resources "wikilink") get tighter around the world,
economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict, as well as
potential environmental problems.[53][54][55][56][57] For example,
improper cropping and irrigation practices have led to
[desertification](desertification "wikilink") in areas of
[Uzbekistan](Uzbekistan "wikilink"), where cotton is a major export. In
the days of the [Soviet Union](Soviet_Union "wikilink"), the [Aral
Sea](Aral_Sea "wikilink") was tapped for agricultural irrigation,
largely of cotton, and now [salination](salination "wikilink") is
widespread.[58][59]

Cotton can also be cultivated to have colors other than the yellowish
off-white typical of modern commercial cotton fibers. [Naturally colored
cotton](Naturally_colored_cotton "wikilink") can come in red, green, and
several shades of brown.[60]

### Genetic modification

[Genetically modified](Genetically_modified "wikilink") (GM) cotton was
developed to reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides. The bacterium
*[Bacillus thuringiensis](Bacillus_thuringiensis "wikilink")* (Bt)
naturally produces a chemical harmful only to a small fraction of
insects, most notably the larvae of [moths and
butterflies](Lepidoptera "wikilink"), [beetles](Coleoptera "wikilink"),
and [flies](Diptera "wikilink"), and harmless to other forms of
life.[61][62][63] The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into
cotton, causing cotton, called [Bt cotton](Bt_cotton "wikilink"), to
produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the
main pests in commercial cotton are
[lepidopteran](lepidoptera "wikilink") larvae, which are killed by the
Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need
to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran
pests (some of which have developed [pyrethroid](pyrethroid "wikilink")
resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology
and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.

But Bt cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests, however, such as
[plant bugs](plant_bug "wikilink"), [stink
bugs](Halyomorpha_halys "wikilink"), and [aphids](aphid "wikilink");
depending on circumstances it may still be desirable to use insecticides
against these. A 2006 study done by Cornell researchers, the Center for
Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on Bt
cotton farming in China found that after seven years these secondary
pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased,
necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-Bt cotton
and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM
seeds.[64] However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
Stanford University and Rutgers University refuted this.[65] They
concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm. The
secondary pests were mostly miridae (plant bugs) whose increase was
related to local temperature and rainfall and only continued to increase
in half the villages studied. Moreover, the increase in insecticide use
for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the
reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption. A 2012
Chinese study concluded that Bt cotton halved the use of pesticides and
doubled the level of ladybirds, lacewings and spiders.[66][67] The
[International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech
Applications](International_Service_for_the_Acquisition_of_Agri-biotech_Applications "wikilink")
(ISAAA) said that, worldwide, GM cotton was planted on an area of 25
million hectares in 2011.[68] This was 69% of the worldwide total area
planted in cotton.

GM cotton acreage in India grew at a rapid rate, increasing from 50,000
hectares in 2002 to 10.6 million hectares in 2011. The total cotton area
in India was 12.1 million hectares in 2011, so GM cotton was grown on
88% of the cotton area. This made India the country with the largest
area of GM cotton in the world.[69] A long-term study on the economic
impacts of Bt cotton in India, published in the Journal
[PNAS](PNAS "wikilink") in 2012, showed that Bt cotton has increased
yields, profits, and living standards of smallholder farmers.[70] The
U.S. GM cotton crop was 4.0 million hectares in 2011 the second largest
area in the world, the Chinese GM cotton crop was third largest by area
with 3.9 million hectares and Pakistan had the fourth largest GM cotton
crop area of 2.6 million hectares in 2011.[71] The initial introduction
of GM cotton proved to be a success in Australia – the yields were
equivalent to the non-transgenic varieties and the crop used much less
pesticide to produce (85% reduction).[72] The subsequent introduction of
a second variety of GM cotton led to increases in GM cotton production
until 95% of the Australian cotton crop was GM in 2009[73] making
Australia the country with the fifth largest GM cotton crop in the
world.[74] Other GM cotton growing countries in 2011 were Argentina,
Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, South Africa and Costa
Rica.[75]

Cotton has been genetically modified for resistance to
[glyphosate](glyphosate "wikilink") a broad-spectrum herbicide
discovered by Monsanto which also sells some of the Bt cotton seeds to
farmers. There are also a number of other cotton seed companies selling
GM cotton around the world. About 62% of the GM cotton grown from 1996
to 2011 was insect resistant, 24%
[stacked](Gene_stacked_event "wikilink") product and 14% herbicide
resistant.[76]

Cotton has [gossypol](gossypol "wikilink"), a toxin that makes it
inedible. However, scientists have silenced the gene that produces the
toxin, making it a potential food crop.[77] On October 17, 2018, the
[USDA](USDA "wikilink") deregulated [GE](Genetic_Engineering "wikilink")
low-gossypol cotton.[78][79]

### Organic production

[Organic cotton](Organic_cotton "wikilink") is generally understood as
cotton from plants not [genetically
modified](Transgenic_plant "wikilink") and that is certified to be grown
without the use of any synthetic agricultural chemicals, such as
[fertilizers](fertilizers "wikilink") or
[pesticides](pesticides "wikilink").[80] Its production also promotes
and enhances biodiversity and biological cycles.[81] In the United
States, organic cotton plantations are required to enforce the [National
Organic Program](National_Organic_Program "wikilink") (NOP). This
institution determines the allowed practices for pest control, growing,
fertilizing, and handling of organic crops.[82] As of 2007, 265,517
bales of organic cotton were produced in 24 countries, and worldwide
production was growing at a rate of more than 50% per year.[83]

## Pests and weeds

![](Greene_Co_Ga1941_Delano.jpg "fig:Greene_Co_Ga1941_Delano.jpg"), US,
1941\]\]
![](Cotton_Harlequin_Bugs.jpg "fig:Cotton_Harlequin_Bugs.jpg")\]\]

The cotton industry relies heavily on chemicals, such as
[herbicides](herbicide "wikilink"),
[fertilizers](fertilizers "wikilink") and
[insecticides](insecticides "wikilink"), although a very small number of
farmers are moving toward an [organic](Organic_farming "wikilink") model
of production, and organic cotton products are now available for
purchase at limited locations. These are popular for baby clothes and
[diapers](diapers "wikilink"). Under most definitions, organic products
do not use [genetic engineering](genetic_engineering "wikilink"). All
natural cotton products are known to be both sustainable and
hypoallergenic.

Historically, in North America, one of the most economically destructive
pests in cotton production has been the [boll
weevil](boll_weevil "wikilink"). Due to the [US Department of
Agriculture](US_Department_of_Agriculture "wikilink")'s highly
successful [Boll Weevil Eradication
Program](Boll_Weevil_Eradication_Program "wikilink") (BWEP), this pest
has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States. This
program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered
[Bt](Bacillus_thuringiensis "wikilink") cotton (which contains a
[bacterial](bacteria "wikilink") gene that codes for a plant-produced
[protein](protein "wikilink") that is toxic to a number of pests such as
[cotton bollworm](cotton_bollworm_(American) "wikilink") and [pink
bollworm](pink_bollworm "wikilink")), has allowed a reduction in the use
of synthetic insecticides.

Other significant global pests of cotton include the pink bollworm,
*[Pectinophora gossypiella](Pectinophora_gossypiella "wikilink")*; the
chili thrips, *[Scirtothrips
dorsalis](Scirtothrips_dorsalis "wikilink")*; the cotton seed bug,
*[Oxycarenus hyalinipennis](Oxycarenus_hyalinipennis "wikilink")*; the
tarnish plant bug, *[Lygus lineolaris](Lygus_lineolaris "wikilink")*;
and the fall armyworm, *[Spodoptera
frugiperda](Spodoptera_frugiperda "wikilink")*, *[Xanthomonas citri
subsp. malvacearum](Xanthomonas_citri_subsp._malvacearum "wikilink")*.

## Harvesting

previously built modules can be seen in the background\]\]
![](Cotton_picking_in_India.jpg "fig:Cotton_picking_in_India.jpg"),
2005.\]\]

Most cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is harvested
mechanically, either by a [cotton picker](cotton_picker "wikilink"), a
machine that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the
cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off
the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to
grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a
chemical [defoliant](defoliant "wikilink") or the natural defoliation
that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics,
and without defoliation or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.

Cotton continues to be picked by hand in [developing
countries](developing_country "wikilink").[84]

## Competition from synthetic fibers

The era of manufactured fibers began with the development of
[rayon](rayon "wikilink") in France in the 1890s. Rayon is derived from
a natural cellulose and cannot be considered synthetic, but requires
extensive processing in a manufacturing process, and led the less
expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials. A succession
of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the
following decades. [Acetate](Cellulose_acetate "wikilink") in fiber form
was developed in 1924. [Nylon](Nylon "wikilink"), the first fiber
synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a sewing
thread by DuPont in 1936, followed by DuPont's
[acrylic](acrylic_fiber "wikilink") in 1944. Some garments were created
from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women's
[hosiery](hosiery "wikilink") from nylon, but it was not until the
introduction of [polyester](polyester "wikilink") into the fiber
marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under
threat.[85] The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused
economic hardship in cotton-exporting economies, especially in Central
American countries, such as [Nicaragua](Nicaragua "wikilink"), where
cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the
advent of cheap chemical pesticides. Cotton production recovered in the
1970s, but crashed to pre-1960 levels in the early 1990s.[86]

## Uses

Cotton is used to make a number of textile products. These include
[terrycloth](terrycloth "wikilink") for highly absorbent bath
[towels](towel "wikilink") and [robes](robe "wikilink");
[denim](denim "wikilink") for [blue jeans](Jeans "wikilink");
[cambric](cambric "wikilink"), popularly used in the manufacture of blue
work shirts (from which we get the term
"[blue-collar](blue-collar "wikilink")"); and
[corduroy](corduroy "wikilink"), [seersucker](seersucker "wikilink"),
and cotton [twill](twill "wikilink"). [Socks](Sock "wikilink"),
[underwear](underwear "wikilink"), and most
[T-shirts](T-shirt "wikilink") are made from cotton. Bed sheets often
are made from cotton. Cotton also is used to make yarn used in
[crochet](crochet "wikilink") and [knitting](knitting "wikilink").
Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise
would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process.
While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend
cotton with other fibers, including [rayon](rayon "wikilink") and
[synthetic fibers](synthetic_fiber "wikilink") such as
[polyester](polyester "wikilink"). It can either be used in knitted or
woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier
thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans. Cotton
can be blended also with [linen](linen "wikilink") producing fabrics
with the benefits of both materials. Linen-cotton blends are wrinkle
resistant and retain heat more effectively than only linen, and are
thinner, stronger and lighter than only cotton.[87]

In addition to the [textile industry](textile_industry "wikilink"),
cotton is used in [fishing nets](fishing_net "wikilink"), [coffee
filters](coffee_filter "wikilink"), [tents](tent "wikilink"), explosives
manufacture (see [nitrocellulose](nitrocellulose "wikilink")), [cotton
paper](cotton_paper "wikilink"), and in
[bookbinding](bookbinding "wikilink"). The first Chinese
[paper](papermaking "wikilink") was made of cotton fiber. [Fire
hoses](Fire_hose "wikilink") were once made of cotton.

The cottonseed which remains after the cotton is ginned is used to
produce [cottonseed oil](cottonseed_oil "wikilink"), which, after
refining, can be consumed by humans like any other [vegetable
oil](vegetable_oil "wikilink"). The [cottonseed
meal](cottonseed_meal "wikilink") that is left generally is fed to
[ruminant](ruminant "wikilink") livestock; the
[gossypol](gossypol "wikilink") remaining in the meal is toxic to
[monogastric](monogastric "wikilink") animals. Cottonseed hulls can be
added to dairy cattle rations for roughage. During the American slavery
period, cotton root bark was used in [folk
remedies](folk_remedies "wikilink") as an
[abortifacient](abortifacient "wikilink"), that is, to induce a
miscarriage. Gossypol was one of the many substances found in all parts
of the cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as 'poisonous
pigment'. It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even
restrict the mobility of the sperm. Also, it is thought to interfere
with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain
hormones.[88]

Cotton linters are fine, silky fibers which adhere to the seeds of the
cotton plant after ginning. These curly fibers typically are less than
long. The term also may apply to the longer textile fiber staple lint as
well as the shorter fuzzy fibers from some upland species. Linters are
traditionally used in the manufacture of paper and as a raw material in
the manufacture of [cellulose](cellulose "wikilink"). In the UK, linters
are referred to as "cotton wool". This can also be a refined product
(*absorbent cotton* in U.S. usage) which has
[medical](medical "wikilink"), [cosmetic](Cosmetics "wikilink") and many
other practical uses. The first medical use of cotton wool was by
[Sampson Gamgee](Sampson_Gamgee "wikilink") at the Queen's Hospital
(later the General Hospital) in [Birmingham](Birmingham "wikilink"),
England.

Shiny cotton is a processed version of the fiber that can be made into
cloth resembling [satin](satin "wikilink") for shirts and suits.[89]
However, it is hydrophobic (does not absorb water easily), which makes
it unfit for use in bath and dish towels (although examples of these
made from shiny cotton are seen).

Long staple (LS cotton) is cotton of a longer fibre length and therefore
of higher quality, while [Extra-long staple
cotton](Gossypium_barbadense "wikilink") (ELS cotton) has longer fibre
length still and of even higher quality. The name "Egyptian cotton" is
broadly associated high quality cottons and is often an LS or (less
often) an ELS cotton.[90] The American cotton variety *Pima* cotton is
often compared to Egyptian cotton, as both are used in high quality bed
sheets and other cotton products. While Pima cotton is often grown in
the American southwest,[91] the Pima name is now used by
cotton-producing nations such as Peru, Australia and Israel.[92] Not all
products bearing the Pima name are made with the finest cotton:
American-grown ELS Pima cotton is trademarked as *Supima*<sup>®</sup>
cotton.[93]

![](Shimul_tula_(cotton).jpg "Shimul_tula_(cotton).jpg")

**Cotton lisle** is a finely-spun, tightly twisted type of cotton that
is noted for being strong and durable. Lisle is composed of two strands
that have each been twisted an extra twist per inch than ordinary yarns
and combined to create a single thread. The yarn is spun so that it is
compact and solid. This cotton is used mainly for underwear, stockings,
and gloves. Colors applied to this yarn are noted for being more
brilliant than colors applied to softer yarn. This type of thread was
first made in the city of Lisle, France (now [Lille](Lille "wikilink")),
hence its name.[94][95][96]

## International trade

![](CottonYield.png "CottonYield.png")

The largest producers of cotton, currently (2009), are China and India,
with annual production of about 34 million bales and 33.4 million bales,
respectively; most of this production is consumed by their respective
textile industries. The largest exporters of raw cotton are the United
States, with sales of $4.9 billion, and Africa, with sales of $2.1
billion. The total international trade is estimated to be $12 billion.
Africa's share of the cotton trade has doubled since 1980. Neither area
has a significant domestic textile industry, textile manufacturing
having moved to developing nations in Eastern and South Asia such as
India and China. In Africa, cotton is grown by numerous small holders.
Dunavant Enterprises, based in [Memphis,
Tennessee](Memphis,_Tennessee "wikilink"), is the leading cotton broker
in Africa, with hundreds of purchasing agents. It operates [cotton
gins](cotton_gin "wikilink") in Uganda, Mozambique, and Zambia. In
Zambia, it often offers loans for seed and expenses to the 180,000 small
farmers who grow cotton for it, as well as advice on farming methods.
[Cargill](Cargill "wikilink") also purchases cotton in Africa for
export.

The 25,000 cotton growers in the United States are heavily
[subsidized](subsidy "wikilink") at the rate of $2 billion per year
although China now provides the highest overall level of cotton sector
support.[97] The future of these subsidies is uncertain and has led to
anticipatory expansion of cotton brokers' operations in Africa. Dunavant
expanded in Africa by buying out local operations. This is only possible
in former British colonies and Mozambique; former French colonies
continue to maintain tight monopolies, inherited from their former
colonialist masters, on cotton purchases at low fixed prices.[98]

The five leading [exporters](export "wikilink") of cotton in 2019 are
(1) [India](India "wikilink"), (2) the [United
States](United_States "wikilink"), (3) [China](China "wikilink"), (4)
[Brazil](Brazil "wikilink"), and (5) [Pakistan](Pakistan "wikilink").

In [India](India "wikilink"), the states of
[Maharashtra](Maharashtra "wikilink") (26.63%),
[Gujarat](Gujarat "wikilink") (17.96%) and [Andhra
Pradesh](Andhra_Pradesh "wikilink") (13.75%) and also Madhya Pradesh are
the leading cotton producing states,[100] these states have a
predominantly tropical wet and dry climate.

In the United States, the state of [Texas](Texas "wikilink") led in
total production as of 2004,[101] while the state of
[California](California "wikilink") had the highest [yield per
acre](Crop_yield "wikilink").[102]

### Fair trade

Cotton is an enormously important commodity throughout the world.
However, many farmers in developing countries receive a low price for
their produce, or find it difficult to compete with developed countries.

This has led to an international dispute (see [United States – Brazil
cotton dispute](United_States_–_Brazil_cotton_dispute "wikilink")):

> On 27 September 2002, Brazil requested consultations with the US
> regarding prohibited and actionable subsidies provided to US
> producers, users and/or exporters of upland cotton, as well as
> legislation, regulations, statutory instruments and amendments thereto
> providing such subsidies (including export credits), grants, and any
> other assistance to the US producers, users and exporters of upland
> cotton.[103]
>
> On 8 September 2004, the Panel Report recommended that the United
> States "withdraw" export credit guarantees and payments to domestic
> users and exporters, and "take appropriate steps to remove the adverse
> effects or withdraw" the mandatory price-contingent subsidy
> measures.[104]

While Brazil was fighting the US through the WTO's Dispute Settlement
Mechanism against a heavily subsidized cotton industry, a group of four
least-developed African countries – Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and
Mali – also known as "Cotton-4" have been the leading protagonist for
the reduction of US cotton subsidies through negotiations. The four
introduced a "Sectoral Initiative in Favour of Cotton", presented by
Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaoré during the Trade Negotiations
Committee on 10 June 2003.[105]

In addition to concerns over subsidies, the cotton industries of some
countries are criticized for employing child labor and damaging workers'
health by exposure to pesticides used in production. The [Environmental
Justice Foundation](Environmental_Justice_Foundation "wikilink") has
campaigned against the prevalent use of forced child and adult labor in
cotton production in [Uzbekistan](Uzbekistan "wikilink"), the world's
third largest cotton exporter.[106] The international production and
trade situation has led to "[fair trade](fair_trade "wikilink")" cotton
clothing and footwear, joining a rapidly growing market for organic
clothing, fair fashion or "ethical fashion". The fair trade system was
initiated in 2005 with producers from [Cameroon](Cameroon "wikilink"),
[Mali](Mali "wikilink") and [Senegal](Senegal "wikilink").[107]

## Genome

There is a public effort to sequence the genome of cotton. It was
started in 2007 by a consortium of public researchers.[112] Their aim is
to sequence the genome of cultivated, tetraploid cotton. "Tetraploid"
means that its nucleus has two separate genomes, called A and D. The
consortium agreed to first sequence the D-genome wild relative of
cultivated cotton (*G. raimondii*, a Central American species) because
it is small and has few repetitive elements. It has nearly one-third of
the bases of tetraploid cotton, and each chromosome occurs only once.
Then, the A genome of *G. arboreum* would be sequenced. Its genome is
roughly twice that of *G. raimondii*. Part of the difference in size is
due the amplification of *retrotransposons* (GORGE). After both diploid
genomes are assembled, they would be used as models for sequencing the
genomes of tetraploid cultivated species. Without knowing the diploid
genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of AD genomes would co-assemble,
and their repetitive elements would assemble independently into A and D
sequences respectively. There would be no way to untangle the mess of AD
sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.

The public sector effort continues with the goal to create a
high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources.
The effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids, as
well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in
assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, the companies
[Monsanto](Monsanto "wikilink") and
[Illumina](Illumina_(company) "wikilink") completed enough Illumina
sequencing to cover the D genome of *G. raimondii* about 50x.[113] They
announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This
public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the
cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled from all of this raw
material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes
of cultivated varieties of cotton, but much work remains.

As of 2014, at least one assembled cotton genome had been reported.[114]

[4] A number of large dictionaries were written in Arabic during
medieval times. Searchable copies of nearly all of the main medieval
Arabic dictionaries are online at

[AlWaraq.net](http://www.alwaraq.net/Core/AlwaraqSrv/getsubjectex?fkey=4&offset=1&subjectid=37).
One of the most esteemed of the dictionaries is [Ismail ibn Hammad
al-Jawhari](Ismail_ibn_Hammad_al-Jawhari "wikilink")'s *"Al-Sihah"*
which is dated around and shortly after year 1000. The biggest is [Ibn
Manzur](Ibn_Manzur "wikilink")'s *"Lisan Al-Arab"* which is dated 1290
but most of its contents were taken from a variety of earlier sources,
including 9th- and 10th-century sources. Often Ibn Manzur names his
source then quotes from it. Therefore, if the reader recognizes the name
of Ibn Manzur's source, a date considerably earlier than 1290 can often
be assigned to what is said. A list giving the year of death of a number
of individuals who Ibn Manzur quotes from is in

[8] Quote: "One of the funerary chambers, dating to around 5500 BC, had
contained an adult male lying on his side with legs flexed backward and
a young child, approximately one or two years old, at his feet. Next to
the adult's left wrist were eight copper beads which had once formed a
bracelet. As such metal beads were only found in one other Neolithic
burial at Mehrgarh, he must have been an extraordinarily wealthy and
important person. Microscopic analysis showed that each bead had been
made by beating and heating copper ore into a thin sheet which had then
been rolled around a narrow rod. Substantial corrosion prevented a
detailed technological study of the beads; yet this turned out to be a
blessing as the corrosion had led to the preservation of something quite
remarkable inside one of the beads — a piece of cotton. ... After
further microscopic study, the fibres were unquestionably identified as
cotton; it was, in fact, a bundle of both unripe and ripe fibres that
had been wound together to make a thread, these being differentiated by
the thickness of their cell walls. As such, this copper bead contained
the earliest known use of cotton in the world by at least a thousand
years. The next earliest was also found at Mehrgarh: a collection of
cotton seeds discovered amidst charred wheat and barley grains outside
one of its mud-brick rooms."

[9] Quote: "The metallurgical analysis of a copper bead from a Neolithic
burial (6th millennium bc ) at Mehrgarh, Pakistan, allowed the recovery
of several threads, preserved by mineralization. They were characterized
according to new procedure, combining the use of a reflected-light
microscope and a scanning electron microscope, and identified as cotton
(Gossypium sp.). The Mehrgarh fibres constitute the earliest known
example of cotton in the Old World and put the date of the first use of
this textile plant back by more than a millennium. Even though it is not
possible to ascertain that the fibres came from an already domesticated
species, the evidence suggests an early origin, possibly in the Kachi
Plain, of one of the Old World cottons.

Old World. It was first domesticated near the Indus Valley before 6000
BC (Moulherat et al. 2002)."
