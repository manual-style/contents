[thumb\|upright\| white 100% [cotton](cotton "wikilink") coutil,
pre-washed](/File:White_coutil.jpg "wikilink")**Coutil** (or
**Coutille**) is [woven](/Weaving "wikilink") [cloth](/cloth "wikilink")
created specifically for making [corsets](/corset "wikilink").[1] It is
woven tightly to inhibit penetration of the corset's
[bones](/Bone_(corsetry) "wikilink") and resist stretching. Coutil has a
high [cotton](/cotton "wikilink") content. Cotton has good dimensional
stability, or a resistance to stretching, which makes it a good choice
for such a stressed garment. Coutil may be made to be plain (similar to
100% cotton facing), [satin](/satin "wikilink"), or
[brocade](/brocade "wikilink"). It is common for coutil to have a
[herringbone](/Herringbone_(cloth) "wikilink") texture, or a similar
woven texture.[2]
