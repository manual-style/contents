**Drill** is stout durable [cotton](/cotton "wikilink") fabric with a
strong bias (diagonal) in the [weave](/weaving "wikilink").[1] It can be
used unbleached, although it is more often
[bleached](/Bleach_(chemical) "wikilink") or [dyed](/dye "wikilink").[2]

## Use in clothing

Light weight drill is used in clothing items such as
[shirts](/shirt "wikilink"), [safari
jackets](/safari_jacket "wikilink"), [blouses](/blouse "wikilink"), and
some types of [sports
clothing](/sportswear_(activewear) "wikilink").[3][4] The heavier
weights were often used in corsets,[5] and are commonly used in work
clothing and uniforms.[6]

The most common use of drill in [uniforms](/uniform "wikilink") and
casual wear is in the form of [khaki drill](/khaki_drill "wikilink").
Usually taken to be a green colour (rather than the tan or sandy color
which has since come to be called [khaki](/khaki "wikilink")), the word
comes from the Hindustani "khak", meaning the color of dust; a term that
became current in mid-19th-century India. In the late 1840s native
regiments raised for frontier service in the newly conquered Punjab were
supplied with 'drab' coloured uniforms to make them "invisible in a land
of dust." Learning from this practice, British troops took to dyeing
their white drill uniforms to obtain more serviceable campaign clothing;
a practice that became widespread during the crisis of the [Indian
Mutiny](/Indian_Mutiny "wikilink"). Initially, improvised dyes produced
clothing that range in shade from lavender grey to earth brown, although
all were referred to as 'khaki.' In the mid-1880s standardised cotton
drill uniforms were produced using a colourfast mineral dye of the shade
now recognised universally as khaki. The fabric soon became a popular
material for military uniforms, and, in the United States following
[World War II](/World_War_II "wikilink"), as veterans returned to
college campuses, it became popular in casual dress as well.[7]

## Other uses

Drill is a versatile fabric that has been used in a variety of
applications. Boat sail drill is a lightweight, unbleached drill used to
make [sails](/sails "wikilink") for sailing craft.[8][9][10] Although
[duck](/Cotton_duck "wikilink") (canvas) was more commonly used for
these purposes,[11] drill has also been used to make tarpaulins, tents,
awnings and canopies,[12] but the use of both fabrics has been
supplanted in modern times with synthetic fabrics. Like duck, drill is
used as a covering for furniture and cushions.[13]
