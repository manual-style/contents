***Eisengarn***, meaning "iron yarn" in English, is a light-reflecting,
strong, waxed-cotton thread. It was invented and manufactured in Germany
in the mid-19th century, but is now most well known for its use in cloth
woven for the tubular-steel chairs designed by [Marcel
Breuer](Marcel_Breuer "wikilink") while he was a teacher at the
[Bauhaus](Bauhaus "wikilink") design school.

The yarn is also known as ***Glanzgarn*** ('gloss' or 'glazed' yarn).
[1]

## Manufacture

Despite the name, there is no iron in *eisengarn*. The name refers to
its strength and metallic shine. It is made by soaking cotton threads in
a starch and [paraffin wax](paraffin_wax "wikilink") solution. The
threads are dried and then stretched and polished by steel rollers and
brushes. The end result of the process is a lustrous, tear-resistant
yarn which is extremely hardwearing.[2][3]

## History

![](Barmen_(1870).jpg "fig:Barmen_(1870).jpg")
![](Netz.jpg "fig:Netz.jpg") The *eisengarn* manufacturing process was
invented in the mid-19th century in a factory in
[Barmen](Barmen "wikilink"), now part of the city of
[Wuppertal](Wuppertal "wikilink"), east of the river
[Rhine](Rhine "wikilink").[4]

It was used as a sewing thread and for making lace, shoe laces, hat
strings, ribbons, lining materials and in the cable industry.[5]

The manufacture of the yarn gave a considerable boost to the textile
industry of Barmen and the surrounding region. By 1875, the Wuppertal
company Barthels & Feldhoff employed more than 300 people in eisengarn
production.[6]

In 1927 the weaver and textile designer [Margaretha
Reichardt](Margaretha_Reichardt "wikilink") (1907–1984), then a student
at the Bauhaus design school, experimented and improved the quality of
the thread and developed cloth and strapping material made from
*eisengarn* for use on Marcel Breuer's tubular steel chairs, such as the
[Wassily Chair](Wassily_Chair "wikilink").[7][8]

Light-weight tubular steel seating was also used in aircraft seating in
the 1930s and Reichardt's improved version of *eisengarn* was used as a
covering for the seats.[9][10]

A more prosaic use for the strong eisengarn thread was, and still is,
for making colourful [string shopping bags](String_bag "wikilink"),
which were popular in the former [East
Germany](East_Germany "wikilink"), and are now an
[Ostalgie](Ostalgie "wikilink") item.[11] When the bag is not in use,
the nature of the eisengarn yarn enables it to be compressed so that it
takes up very little space.[12]
