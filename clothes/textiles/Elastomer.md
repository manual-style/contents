An **elastomer** is a [polymer](polymer "wikilink") with
[viscoelasticity](viscoelasticity "wikilink") (i.e., both
[viscosity](viscosity "wikilink") and
[elasticity](Elasticity_(physics) "wikilink")) and has very weak
[intermolecular forces](intermolecular_force "wikilink"), generally low
[Young's modulus](Young's_modulus "wikilink") and high [failure
strain](Deformation_(mechanics) "wikilink") compared with other
materials.[1] The term, a [portmanteau](portmanteau "wikilink") of
*elastic polymer*,[2] is often used interchangeably with
[rubber](Synthetic_rubber "wikilink"), although the latter is preferred
when referring to [vulcanisates](vulcanization "wikilink").[3] Each of
the [monomers](monomer "wikilink") which link to form the polymer is
usually a compound of several [elements](chemical_elements "wikilink")
among [carbon](carbon "wikilink"), [hydrogen](hydrogen "wikilink"),
[oxygen](oxygen "wikilink") and [silicon](silicon "wikilink").
Elastomers are [amorphous polymers](amorphous_polymer "wikilink")
maintained above their [glass transition
temperature](glass_transition_temperature "wikilink"), so that
considerable [molecular reconformation](segmental_motion "wikilink"),
without breaking of [covalent bonds](covalent_bonds "wikilink"), is
feasible. At [ambient temperatures](ambient_temperature "wikilink"),
such rubbers are thus relatively soft ([E](Young's_modulus "wikilink") ≈
3 M[Pa](Pascal_(unit) "wikilink")) and deformable. Their primary uses
are for [seals](Seal_(mechanical) "wikilink"),
[adhesives](adhesive "wikilink") and molded flexible parts. Application
areas for different types of rubber are manifold and cover segments as
diverse as tires, [soles for shoes](sole_(shoe) "wikilink"), and
[damping](damping "wikilink") and
[insulating](Thermal_insulation "wikilink") elements. The importance of
these rubbers can be judged from the fact that global revenues are
forecast to rise to US$56 billion in 2020.[4][5]

[IUPAC](International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry "wikilink")
defines the term "elastomer" by "[Polymer](Polymer "wikilink") that
displays rubber-like elasticity."[6]

Manufacturers of Elastomeric parts include NoProto, PrintForm, 3D
Systems, and Afformativ.

Rubber-like solids with elastic properties are called elastomers.
Polymer chains are held together in these materials by relatively weak
[intermolecular bonds](molecule "wikilink"), which permit the polymers
to stretch in response to macroscopic stresses. [Natural
rubber](Natural_rubber "wikilink"), [neoprene
rubber](neoprene_rubber "wikilink"), [buna-s](buna-s "wikilink") and
[buna-n](buna-n "wikilink") are all examples of such elastomers.

![](Polymer_picture.svg "Polymer_picture.svg")

Elastomers are usually [thermosets](thermoset "wikilink") (requiring
[vulcanization](vulcanization "wikilink")) but may also be
[thermoplastic](thermoplastic "wikilink") (see [thermoplastic
elastomer](thermoplastic_elastomer "wikilink")). The long polymer chains
[cross-link](cross-link "wikilink") during curing, i.e., vulcanizing.
The molecular structure of elastomers can be imagined as a 'spaghetti
and meatball' structure, with the meatballs signifying cross-links. The
elasticity is derived from the ability of the long chains to reconfigure
themselves to distribute an applied stress. The covalent cross-linkages
ensure that the elastomer will return to its original configuration when
the stress is removed. As a result of this extreme flexibility,
elastomers can reversibly extend from 5–700%, depending on the specific
material. Without the cross-linkages or with short, uneasily
reconfigured chains, the applied stress would result in a permanent
deformation.

Temperature effects are also present in the demonstrated elasticity of a
polymer. Elastomers that have cooled to a glassy or crystalline phase
will have less mobile chains, and consequentially less elasticity, than
those manipulated at temperatures higher than the glass transition
temperature of the polymer.

It is also possible for a polymer to exhibit elasticity that is not due
to covalent cross-links, but instead for [thermodynamic
reasons](Thermodynamic_theory_of_polymer_elasticity "wikilink").
