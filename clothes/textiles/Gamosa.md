[thumb\|350px\|A Gamusa made from [Pat silk](Assam_silk "wikilink") with

(Assamese: গামোচা)is an article of great significance for the people of
[Assam](/Assam "wikilink").

It is generally a white rectangular piece of cloth with primarily a red
border on three sides and red woven motifs on the fourth (in addition to
red, other colors are also used). Although [cotton](/cotton "wikilink")
yarn is the most common material for making/weaving gamosas, there are
special occasion ones made from [Pat
silk](/Assam_silk#Pat_silk "wikilink").

A 1,455.3 meter long Gamocha displayed in Delhi created world record as
it became world’s longest hand woven piece of cloth.[1]

## Origin of the name

Literally translated, it means 'something to wipe the body with'
(*Ga*=body, *musa*=to wipe) however, interpreting the word *gamosa* as
the body-wiping towel is misleading.[2] The word gamosa is derived from
the [Kamrupi](/Kamarupi_Prakrit "wikilink") word *gamsaw*, the cloth
used to cover the [Bhagavad](/Bhagavad_Gita "wikilink") Purana at the
altar.

## Usage

[thumb\|[Bihu dancer](Bihu_dance "wikilink") wearing a Gamusa around the
head](/Image:Bihu_dancer_with_a_horn.jpg "wikilink") Though it may be
used daily to wipe the body after a bath (an act of purification), the
use is not restricted to this.

-   It is used to cover the altar at the prayer hall or cover the
    scriptures. An object of
    [reverence](/reverence_(attitude) "wikilink") is never placed on the
    bare ground, but always on a *gamusa*.
-   It is used by the farmer as a waistcloth (*tongali*) or a loincloth
    (*suriya*); a [Bihu dancer](/Bihu_dance "wikilink") wraps it around
    the head with a fluffy knot (see picture).
-   It is hung around the neck at the prayer hall (*naamghar*) and was
    thrown over the shoulder in the past to signify social status.
-   Guests are welcomed with the offering of a *gamusa* and *tamul*
    ([betel nut](/betel_nut "wikilink")) and elders are offered gamusas
    (referred to as *bihuwaan* in this case) during
    [Bihu](/Bihu "wikilink").[3]

One can therefore, very well say, that the *gamusa* symbolizes the
indigenous life and culture of Assam.

## Cultural significance

Significantly the *gamusa* is used equally by all irrespective of
religious and ethnic backgrounds.

At par with *gamusa*, there are beautifully woven symbolic clothes with
attractive graphic designs being used by different cultural sub-systems
and ethno-cultural groups as well. [thumb\|A Gamusa border with a

There were various other symbolic elements and designs traditionally in
use, which are now only found in literature, art, sculpture,
architecture, etc. or used for only religious purposes (in particular
occasions only). The typical designs of Assamese-lion, dragon,
flying-lion, etc. were used for symbolizing various purposes and
occasions.

There are efforts underway to have the Gamosa registered with the
[Geographical Indication](/Geographical_Indication "wikilink").[4]
