**Goatskin** refers to the [skin](skin "wikilink") of a
[goat](goat "wikilink"), which by long term usage, is denoted by the
term *[Morocco leather](Morocco_leather "wikilink")*.[1]
[Kidskin](Kidskin "wikilink"), used for gloves, shoes and other
accessories, is traditionally goatskin, although other leathers such as
sheep and kangaroo can be used to make kid.[2][3]

[Tanned](Tanning_(leather) "wikilink") [leather](leather "wikilink")
from goatskin is considered extremely durable and is commonly used to
make [rugs](Carpet "wikilink") (for example in Indonesia) and [carpet
binding](Carpet#Carpet_binding "wikilink"). It is often used for
[gloves](glove "wikilink"), [boots](boot "wikilink"), and other products
that require a soft hide. Kid gloves, popular in [Victorian
times](Victorian_times "wikilink"), are still made today. It has been a
major material for leather [bookbindings](bookbinding "wikilink") for
centuries, and the oldest European binding, that of the [St Cuthbert
Gospel](St_Cuthbert_Gospel "wikilink") in the [British
Library](British_Library "wikilink") is in red goatskin. Goatskin is
used for a traditional Spanish container for wine [bota
bag](bota_bag "wikilink") (or called goatskin). Traditional
[kefir](kefir "wikilink") was made in bags from goatskin.

Non tanned goatskin is used for [parchment](parchment "wikilink") or for
[drumheads](drumhead "wikilink") or [sounding
boards](sounding_board "wikilink") of some musical instruments, e.g.,
[mi코nice](mi코nice "wikilink") in medieval Europe,
[bodhr치n](bodhr치n "wikilink") in Ireland, [esraj](esraj "wikilink") in
India and for instrumental drum skin named *[bedug](bedug "wikilink")*
in Indonesia.

In [Roman mythology](Roman_mythology "wikilink") priests of god
[Lupercalia](Lupercalia "wikilink") wore goatskins.[4]

A breed of goat that provides high-quality skin is for example the
[Black Bengal](Black_Bengal_goat "wikilink") breed, native to
[Bangladesh](Bangladesh "wikilink").

In 1974, there was controversy in the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") surrounding goatskin products
originating in [Haiti](Haiti "wikilink").[5] The U.S. [Centers for
Disease Control](Centers_for_Disease_Control "wikilink") discovered that
some of these products contained deadly [anthrax](anthrax "wikilink")
spores. All Haitian goatskin products in the USA were recalled, although
no fatalities were reported.
