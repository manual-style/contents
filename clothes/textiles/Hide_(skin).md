A **hide** or **skin** is an animal [skin](skin "wikilink") treated for
human use. The word "hide" is related to the German word "Haut" which
means [skin](skin "wikilink"). The industry defines hides as "skins" of
large animals *e.g*. cow, buffalo; the skins refer to "skins" of smaller
animals: [goat](goat "wikilink"), [sheep](sheep "wikilink"),
[deer](deer "wikilink"), [pig](pig "wikilink"), [fish](fish "wikilink"),
[alligator](alligator "wikilink"), [snake](snake "wikilink"), etc.
Common commercial hides include [leather](leather "wikilink") from
[cattle](cattle "wikilink") and other [livestock](livestock "wikilink")
animals, [buckskin](buckskin_(leather) "wikilink"), [alligator
skin](alligator "wikilink") and [snake skin](snake_skin "wikilink"). All
are used for [shoes](shoes "wikilink"), [clothes](clothes "wikilink"),
leather bags, belts and other [fashion](fashion "wikilink")
[accessories](Fashion_accessory "wikilink"). Leather is also used in
[cars](Car "wikilink"), [upholstery,](Upholstery "wikilink") [interior
decorating](interior_decorating "wikilink"), [horse
tack](horse_tack "wikilink") and [harnesses](horse_harness "wikilink").
Skins are sometimes still gathered from [hunting](hunting "wikilink")
and processed at a domestic or artisanal level but most [leather
making](leather_making "wikilink") is now
[industrialized](industrialization "wikilink") and large-scale. Various
[tannins](tannin "wikilink") are used for this purpose.

The term "skin" is sometimes expanded to include
[furs](furs "wikilink"), which are harvested from various species,
including [cats](felidae "wikilink"),
[mustelids](mustelidae "wikilink"), and [bears](bear "wikilink").

## History

Archaeologists believe that animal hides provided an important source of
[clothing](clothing "wikilink") and [shelter](hut_(dwelling) "wikilink")
for all prehistoric humans and their use continued among
non-agricultural societies into modern times. The
[Inuit](Inuit "wikilink"), for example, used animal hides for summer
[tents](tent "wikilink"), [waterproof](waterproof "wikilink") clothes,
and [kayaks](kayak "wikilink"). In [early medieval
ages](Early_Middle_Ages "wikilink") hides were used to protect wooden
castles and defense buildings from setting alight during a
[siege](siege "wikilink"). Various [American
Indian](Native_Americans_in_the_United_States "wikilink") tribes used
hides in the construction of [tepees](tepee "wikilink") and
[wigwams](wigwam "wikilink"), [moccasins](moccasins "wikilink"), and
[buckskins](buckskin_(leather) "wikilink"). They were sometimes used as
[window](window "wikilink") coverings. Until the invention of
[plastic](plastic "wikilink") [drum heads](drum_head "wikilink") in the
1950s, animal hides or [metal](metal "wikilink") was used.

[Parchment](Parchment "wikilink") and [vellum](vellum "wikilink")—a kind
of [paper](paper "wikilink") made from processed skins—was introduced to
the Eastern Mediterranean during the [Iron Age](Iron_Age "wikilink"),
supposedly at [Pergamon](Pergamon "wikilink").

The [Assize of Weights and
Measures](Assize_of_Weights_and_Measures "wikilink")—one of the
[statutes of uncertain date](statutes_of_uncertain_date "wikilink") from
—mentions [rawhide](rawhide_(textile) "wikilink"),
[gloves](glove "wikilink"), [parchment](parchment "wikilink"), and
[vellum](vellum "wikilink") among the principal items of
[England](Kingdom_of_England "wikilink")'s commerce. A standardized
shipload of leather (a [last](last_(unit) "wikilink")) consisted of 20
[dicker](dicker_(unit) "wikilink") of 10 cowhides.
[Rabbit](European_rabbit "wikilink") and
[squirrel](gray_squirrel "wikilink") skins were traded and taxed in
[timbers](timber_(unit) "wikilink") of 40 hides each. Skins were also
traded in [binds](bind_(unit) "wikilink") of 32 or 33 skins each, while
gloves were sold in dickers of 10 pair and dozens of 12 pair. The
parchment and vellum was traded based on dozens of the original
[sheepskins](sheepskin "wikilink") from which they were prepared.[1][2]

Rare furs have been a notable [status symbol](status_symbol "wikilink")
throughout history. [Ermine](Ermine "wikilink") fur was particularly
associated with European nobility, with the black-tipped tails arranged
around the edges of the robes to produce a pattern of black diamonds on
a white field. Demand for [beaver](beaver "wikilink")
[hats](hat "wikilink") in the 17th and 18th century drove some of the
initial exploration of [North America](North_America "wikilink"),
particularly in [Canada](Canada "wikilink"), and even prompted wars
among native tribes competing for the most productive areas. Natural
leather continues to be used for many expensive products from
[limousine](limousine "wikilink") upholstery to designer [cellular
phone](cellular_phone "wikilink") cases. There are, however, many forms
of [artificial leather](artificial_leather "wikilink") and fur now
available, which are usually cheaper alternatives.

## Production

![](Tanned_leather.JPG "fig:Tanned_leather.JPG")
![](Finishgradingleather.jpg "fig:Finishgradingleather.jpg") Animal
hides and skins are usually processed fresh or salted and tanned. Skins
sometimes are stretched, dried, and tanned. Most hides are processed
from domesticated animals; the most common wild animals used for
fur—[mink](mink "wikilink") and [rabbit](rabbit "wikilink")—are
similarly raised in captivity and farmed. Some others—including
[lynx](lynx "wikilink") and [wolves](wolves "wikilink")—are still
[trapped](Trapping_(Animal) "wikilink") in the wild for their fur.

## Use

Currently, hides are mainly used for [footwear](footwear "wikilink"),
[upholstery](upholstery "wikilink"), leather goods; skins are used for
[clothing](clothing "wikilink"), particularly as
[coats](coat_(clothing) "wikilink"), [gloves](Glove "wikilink"), leather
goods and [footwear](footwear "wikilink"). It is also used for
[bookbinding](bookbinding "wikilink").

Many traditional [drums](drum "wikilink"), especially [hand
drums](hand_drum "wikilink") like the [pandeiro](pandeiro "wikilink"),
continue to be made using natural skins. The [alligator
drum](alligator_drum "wikilink") was formerly important in [Chinese
music](Chinese_music "wikilink"). The
[Chinese](Chinese_music "wikilink") [sanxian](sanxian "wikilink") and
[Okinawan](Ryukyuan_music "wikilink") [sanshin](sanshin "wikilink") are
usually prepared from [snakeskin](snakeskin "wikilink"), while their
[Japanese](Japanese_music "wikilink") equivalent, the
[shamisen](shamisen "wikilink"), is made from [dogskin](dog "wikilink")
in the case of students and [catskin](cat "wikilink") in the case of
professional players. The
[African-American](African-Americans "wikilink")
[banjo](banjo "wikilink") was originally made from skins but is now
often synthetic. "Hides" is used as a slang term to refer to a
drumset.[3]

[Kangaroo leather](Kangaroo_leather "wikilink") is the most common
material for the construction of [bullwhips](bullwhip "wikilink").
[Stingray](Stingray "wikilink") rawhide is a common material for the
grips of [Chinese](Chinese_swords "wikilink"),
[Japanese](Japanese_swords "wikilink"), and [Scottish
swords](Scottish_sword "wikilink").

[Pig](Pig "wikilink") skins are processed as [pork
rinds](pork_rind "wikilink").

[Rabbit](Rabbit "wikilink") fur is popular for hats, coats, and glove
linings.

## Controversy

[Animal rights](Animal_rights "wikilink") activists generally protest
the use of animal hides for human clothing. Forms of protest range from
[PETA](PETA "wikilink")'s "I would rather go naked than wear fur"
campaign, although more shocking and direct action, like damaging furs
with red [paint](paint "wikilink") in imitation of
[blood](blood "wikilink"), has been toned down, like the "Ink, not Mink"
campaign.
