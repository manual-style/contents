**Jersey** is a [knit](/Knitting "wikilink")
[fabric](/Textile "wikilink") used predominantly for
[clothing](/clothing "wikilink") manufacture. It was originally made of
[wool](/wool "wikilink"), but is now made of [wool](/wool "wikilink"),
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink"), and [synthetic
fibers](/synthetic_fiber "wikilink"). Since
[medieval](/Middle_ages "wikilink") times, [Jersey](/Jersey "wikilink"),
[Channel Islands](/Channel_Islands "wikilink"), where the material was
first produced, had been an important exporter of knitted goods[1] and
the fabric in wool from Jersey became well known. The fabric can be a
very stretchy [single knitting](/knitting "wikilink"), usually
light-weight, jersey with one flat side and one piled side.[2] When made
with a lightweight yarn, this is the fabric most often used to make
[T-shirts](/T-shirt "wikilink").[3] Or it can be a [double
knitted](/Double_knitting "wikilink") jersey (interlock jersey), with
less stretch, that creates a heavier fabric of two single jerseys
knitted together to leave the two flat sides on the outsides of the
fabric, with the piles in the middle.[4] Interlock jersey is sometimes
used as a more formal alternative knit to the traditional
[piqué](/Piqué_(weaving) "wikilink") knit for [polo
shirts](/polo_shirt "wikilink"), and is generally the preferred knit for
those made from [pima cotton](/pima_cotton "wikilink"). Jersey is
considered to be an excellent fabric for [draped
garments](/draped_garment "wikilink"), such as dresses, and women's
tops.

The following types of jersey can be distinguished:

-   Single jersey—weight: 140 g/m²
-   Double jersey
-   Interlock jersey
-   Jacquard jersey
-   Clocqué jersey
-   Stretch jersey (per [American
    Eagle](/American_Eagle_Outfitters "wikilink"))

## History

In 1916, [Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel](/Coco_Chanel "wikilink") upset the
fashion industry by using jersey at a time when it was strictly
associated with underwear. "This designer made jersey what it is
today—we hope she's satisfied," said
*[Vogue](/Vogue_(magazine) "wikilink")* in 1999. "It's almost as much
part of our lives as blue [serge](/serge_(fabric) "wikilink") is."[5]
