**Jute** is a long, soft, shiny [vegetable
fiber](/Fiber_crop "wikilink") that can be spun into coarse, strong
threads. It is produced primarily from plants in the genus
*[Corchorus](/Corchorus "wikilink")*, which was once classified with the
family [Tiliaceae](/Tiliaceae "wikilink"), and more recently with
[Malvaceae](/Malvaceae "wikilink"). The primary source of the fiber is
*[Corchorus olitorius](/Corchorus_olitorius "wikilink")*, but it is
considered inferior to *[Corchorus
capsularis](/Corchorus_capsularis "wikilink")*.[1] "Jute" is the name of
the plant or fiber used to make [burlap, hessian or
gunny](/Hessian_(cloth) "wikilink") cloth.

Jute is one of the most affordable [natural
fibers](/natural_fiber "wikilink"), and second only to
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink") in the amount produced and variety of uses.
Jute fibers are composed primarily of the plant materials
[cellulose](/cellulose "wikilink") and [lignin](/lignin "wikilink"). It
falls into the [bast fiber](/bast_fiber "wikilink") category (fiber
collected from bast, the [phloem](/phloem "wikilink") of the plant,
sometimes called the "skin") along with [kenaf](/kenaf "wikilink"),
[industrial hemp](/Hemp "wikilink"), [flax](/flax "wikilink")
([linen](/linen "wikilink")), [ramie](/ramie "wikilink"), etc. The
industrial term for jute fiber is *raw jute*. The fibers are off-white
to brown, and 1–4 metres (3–13 feet) long. Jute is also called the
*golden fiber* for its color and high cash value.

## Cultivation

[thumb\|Jute plants (*Corchorus olitorius* and *Corchorus
capsularis*)](/File:Jute_plant.gif "wikilink") The jute plant needs a
plain [alluvial](/alluvial "wikilink") soil and standing water. The
suitable climate for growing jute (warm and wet) is offered by the
[monsoon](/monsoon "wikilink") climate, during the monsoon season.
Temperatures from 20˚C to 40˚C and relative humidity of 70%–80% are
favourable for successful cultivation. Jute requires 5–8 cm of rainfall
weekly, and more during the sowing time. Soft water is necessary for
jute production.

### White jute (*Corchorus capsularis*)

Historical documents (including
*[Ain-e-Akbari](/Ain-e-Akbari "wikilink")* by [Abul
Fazal](/Abu'l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak "wikilink") in 1590) state that the poor
villagers of [India](/India "wikilink") used to wear clothes made of
jute. The weavers used simple hand spinning wheels and hand looms, and
spun cotton yarns as well. History also suggests that Indians,
especially [Bengalis](/Bengali_people "wikilink"), used ropes and twines
made of white jute from ancient times for household and other uses. It
is highly functional for carrying grains or other agricultural products.

### Tossa jute (*Corchorus olitorius*)

Tossa jute (*[Corchorus olitorius](/Corchorus_olitorius "wikilink")*) is
a variety thought native to [South Asia](/South_Asia "wikilink"). It is
grown for both fiber and culinary purposes. People use the leaves as an
ingredient in a [mucilaginous](/Mucilage "wikilink")
[potherb](/Leaf_vegetable "wikilink") called
"[molokhiya](/molokhiya "wikilink")" ([ملوخية](/ملوخية "wikilink"), of
uncertain etymology). It is popular in some
[Arabian](/Arabian "wikilink") countries such as
[Egypt](/Egypt "wikilink"), [Jordan](/Jordan "wikilink"), and
[Syria](/Syria "wikilink") as a soup-based dish, sometimes with meat
over rice or [lentils](/lentil "wikilink"). The [Book of
Job](/Book_of_Job "wikilink") (chapter 30, verse 4), in the King James
translation of the [Hebrew Bible](/Hebrew_Bible "wikilink") מלוח
*MaLOo-aĤ* "salty",[2] mentions this vegetable potherb as "mallow,
giving rise to the term [Jew](/Jew "wikilink")'s Mallow.[3] It is high
in [protein](/protein "wikilink"), [vitamin C](/vitamin_C "wikilink"),
[beta-carotene](/beta-carotene "wikilink"),
[calcium](/calcium "wikilink"), and [iron](/iron "wikilink").

[Bangladesh](/Bangladesh "wikilink") and other countries in [Southeast
Asia](/Southeast_Asia "wikilink"), and the [South
Pacific](/Pacific_Ocean "wikilink") mainly use jute for its fiber in.
Tossa jute fiber is softer, silkier, and stronger than white jute. This
variety shows good sustainability in the [Ganges
Delta](/Ganges_Delta "wikilink") climate. Along with white jute, tossa
jute has also been cultivated in the soil of
[Bengal](/Bengal "wikilink") where it is known as *paat* from the start
of the 19th century. Coremantel, Bangladesh, is the largest global
producer of the tossa jute variety.

## History

Jute was used for making textiles in the [Indus valley
civilization](/Indus_Valley_Civilisation "wikilink") since the 3rd
millennium BC[4]. For centuries, jute has been an integral part of the
culture of [East Bengal](/East_Bengal "wikilink") and some parts of
[West Bengal](/West_Bengal "wikilink"), precisely in the southwest of
Bangladesh. Since the seventeenth century the British started trading in
jute. During the reign of the [British
Empire](/British_Empire "wikilink"), jute was also used in the military.
British jute barons grew rich by processing jute and selling
manufactured products made from it. Dundee Jute Barons and the British
East India Company set up many jute mills in Bengal, and by 1895 jute
industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish [jute
trade](/jute_trade "wikilink"). Many Scots emigrated to Bengal to set up
jute factories. More than a billion jute sandbags were exported from
Bengal to the trenches of [World War I](/World_War_I "wikilink"), and to
the United States south to bag cotton. It was used in the fishing,
construction, art and the arms industries. Initially, due to its
texture, it could only be processed by hand until someone in Dundee
discovered that treating it with [whale oil](/whale_oil "wikilink") made
it machine processable.[5] The industry boomed throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries ("jute weaver" was a recognised trade
occupation in the 1900 UK census), but this trade had largely ceased by
about 1970 due to the emergence of synthetic fibers. In the 21st
century, jute again has become an important export crop around the
world, mainly in Bangladesh.

## Production

[thumb\|Jute stems being [retted](retting "wikilink") in water to
separate the fibers](/File:পাট_পঁচানো.jpg "wikilink") The jute fiber
comes from the stem and ribbon (outer skin) of the jute plant. The
fibers are first extracted by [retting](/retting "wikilink"). The
retting process consists of bundling jute stems together and immersing
them in slow running water. There are two types of retting: stem and
ribbon. After the retting process, stripping begins; women and children
usually do this job. In the stripping process, non-fibrous matter is
scraped off, then the workers dig in and grab the fibers from within the
jute stem.[6]

Jute is a rain-fed crop with little need for fertilizer or pesticides,
in contrast to [cotton](/cotton "wikilink")'s heavy requirements.
Production is concentrated mostly in Bangladesh, as well as
[India](/India "wikilink")'s states of Assam, Bihar, and West Bengal.[7]
India is the world's largest producer of jute,[8] but imported
approximately 162,000 tonnes[9] of raw fiber and 175,000 tonnes[10] of
jute products in 2011. India, [Pakistan](/Pakistan "wikilink"), and
[China](/China "wikilink") import significant quantities of jute fiber
and products from Bangladesh, as do the [United
Kingdom](/United_Kingdom "wikilink"), [Japan](/Japan "wikilink"),
[United States](/United_States "wikilink"),
[France](/France "wikilink"), [Spain](/Spain "wikilink"), [Ivory
Coast](/Ivory_Coast "wikilink"), [Germany](/Germany "wikilink") and
[Brazil](/Brazil "wikilink").

Top ten jute producers, by metric ton, as of 2014[11]

## Genome

At the beginning of the 21st century, in 2002 Bangladesh commissioned a
consortium of researchers from [University of
Dhaka](/University_of_Dhaka "wikilink"), [Bangladesh Jute Research
Institute](/Bangladesh_Jute_Research_Institute "wikilink") (BJRI) and
private software firm DataSoft Systems Bangladesh Ltd., in collaboration
with Centre for Chemical Biology, [University of Science
Malaysia](/University_of_Science_Malaysia "wikilink") and [University of
Hawaii](/University_of_Hawaii "wikilink"), to research different fibers
and hybrid fibers of jute. The draft genome of jute (*Corchorus
olitorius*) was completed.[12]

## Uses

Making twine, rope, and matting are among its uses.

In combination with sugar, the possibility of using jute to build
aeroplane panels has been considered. [13]

Jute is in great demand due to its cheapness, softness, length, lustre
and uniformity of its fiber. It is called the 'brown paper bag' as it is
also the most used product in [gunny sacks](/gunny_sacks "wikilink") to
store rice, wheat, grains, etc. It is also called the 'golden fiber' due
to its versatile nature.

### Fibers

[thumb\|Jute
[fabric](fabric "wikilink")](/File:Tessuto_iuta.jpg "wikilink")
[thumb\|[Coffee](Coffee "wikilink") sacks made of
jute.](/File:Coffee_sacks.jpg "wikilink") [thumb\|Jute fiber is
extracted from retted stem of jute
plants](/File:Jute_fibre_extraction.jpg "wikilink")

Jute matting is used to prevent flood erosion while natural vegetation
becomes established. For this purpose, a natural and biodegradable fiber
is essential.

Jute is the second most important vegetable fiber after cotton due to
its versatility. Jute is used chiefly to make [cloth](/cloth "wikilink")
for wrapping bales of raw cotton, and to make sacks and coarse cloth.
The fibers are also woven into [curtains](/curtain "wikilink"),
[chair](/chair "wikilink") coverings, [carpets](/carpet "wikilink"),
area rugs, [hessian cloth](/Hessian_(cloth) "wikilink"), and backing for
[linoleum](/linoleum "wikilink").

While jute is being replaced by synthetic materials in many of these
uses, some uses take advantage of jute's
[biodegradable](/Biodegradation "wikilink") nature, where synthetics
would be unsuitable. Examples of such uses include containers for
planting young trees, which can be planted directly with the container
without disturbing the roots, and land restoration where jute cloth
prevents erosion occurring while natural vegetation becomes established.

The fibers are used alone or blended with other types of fiber to make
[twine](/twine "wikilink") and [rope](/rope "wikilink"). Jute butts, the
coarse ends of the plants, are used to make inexpensive cloth.
Conversely, very fine threads of jute can be separated out and made into
*imitation silk*. As jute fibers are also being used to make pulp and
paper, and with increasing concern over forest destruction for the [wood
pulp](/wood_pulp "wikilink") used to make most paper, the importance of
jute for this purpose may increase. Jute has a long history of use in
the sackings, carpets, wrapping fabrics (cotton bale), and construction
fabric manufacturing industry.

Jute was used in traditional textile machinery as fibers having
cellulose (vegetable fiber content) and [lignin](/lignin "wikilink")
(wood fiber content). But, the major breakthrough came when the
automobile, pulp and paper, and the furniture and bedding industries
started to use jute and its allied fibers with their non-woven and
composite technology to manufacture nonwovens, [technical
textiles](/technical_textiles "wikilink"), and composites. Therefore,
jute has changed its textile fiber outlook and steadily heading towards
its newer identity, i.e., wood fiber. As a textile fiber, jute has
reached its peak from where there is no hope of progress, but as a wood
fiber jute has many promising features.[14]

Jute is used in the manufacture of a number of fabrics, such as [Hessian
cloth](/Hessian_(cloth) "wikilink"), sacking,
[scrim](/Scrim_(material) "wikilink"), carpet backing cloth (CBC), and
[canvas](/canvas "wikilink"). Hessian, lighter than sacking, is used for
bags, wrappers, wall-coverings, upholstery, and home furnishings.
Sacking, a fabric made of heavy jute fibers, has its use in the name.
CBC made of jute comes in two types. Primary CBC provides a tufting
surface, while secondary CBC is bonded onto the primary backing for an
overlay. Jute packaging is used as an eco-friendly substitute.

Diversified jute products are becoming more and more valuable to the
consumer today. Among these are [espadrilles](/espadrilles "wikilink"),
soft [sweaters](/sweaters "wikilink") and
[cardigans](/Cardigan_(sweater) "wikilink"), floor coverings, home
textiles, high performance technical textiles, geotextiles, composites,
and more.

Jute floor coverings consist of woven and tufted and piled carpets. Jute
mats and mattings with 5/6 mts width and of continuous length are easily
being woven in southern parts of India, in solid and fancy shades, and
in different weaves, like bouclé, Panama, herringbone, etc. Jute mats
and rugs are made both by powerloom and handloom in large volume in
Kerala, India. The traditional Satranji mat is becoming very popular in
home décor. Jute non-wovens and composites can be used for underlay,
linoleum substrate, and more.

Jute has many advantages as a home textile, either replacing cotton or
blending with it. It is a strong, durable, color and light-fast fiber.
Its UV protection, sound and heat insulation, low thermal conduction and
anti-static properties make it a wise choice in home décor. Also,
fabrics made of jute fibers are carbon-dioxide neutral and naturally
decomposable. These properties are also why jute can be used in high
performance technical textiles.[15]

Moreover, jute can be grown in 4–6 months with a huge amount of
cellulose being produced from the jute hurd (inner woody core or
[parenchyma](/parenchyma "wikilink") of the jute stem) that can meet
most of the wood needs of the world. Jute is the major crop among others
that is able to protect deforestation by industrialisation.

Thus, jute is the most environment-friendly fiber starting from the seed
to expired fiber, as the expired fibers can be recycled more than once.

Jute is also used to make ghillie suits, which are used as camouflage
and resemble grasses or brush.

Another diversified jute product is geotextiles, which made this
agricultural commodity more popular in the agricultural sector. It is a
lightly woven fabric made from natural fibers that is used for soil
erosion control, seed protection, weed control, and many other
agricultural and [landscaping](/landscaping "wikilink") uses. The
geotextiles can be used more than a year and the bio-degradable jute
geotextile left to rot on the ground keeps the ground cool and is able
to make the land more fertile.

### Culinary uses

*Corchous olitorius* leaves are used to make
[mulukhiya](/mulukhiya "wikilink"), sometimes considered the Egyptian
national dish, but consumed in Cyprus and other Middle Eastern countries
as well. It is an ingredient for stews, typically cooked with lamb or
chicken.

In Nigeria, leaves of *Corchorus olitorius* are prepared in sticky soup
called *ewedu* together with ingredients such as sweet potato, dried
small fish or shrimp.[16] The leaves are rubbed until foamy or sticky
before adding to the soup. Amongst the Yoruba of Nigeria, the leaves are
called *Ewedu*, and in the Hausa-speaking northern Nigeria, the leaves
are called *turgunuwa* or *lallo*. The cook cuts jute leaves into shreds
and adds them to the soup, which normally also contains ingredients such
as meat or fish, pepper, onions, and spices. Likewise, the
[Lugbara](/Lugbara_people "wikilink") of [Northwestern
Uganda](/West_Nile_sub-region "wikilink") eat the leaves in a soup they
call *pala bi*. Jute is also a [totem](/totem "wikilink") for Ayivu, one
of the Lugbara [clans](/clan "wikilink").

In the Philippines, especially in Ilocano-dominated areas, this
vegetable, locally known as *saluyot*, can be mixed with either bitter
gourd, bamboo shoots, loofah, or sometimes all of them. These have a
slimy and slippery texture.

### Other

[thumb\|Jute stalks drying under the sun for use as
[fuel](fuel "wikilink").](/File:Jute_cane.jpg "wikilink") Diversified
byproducts from jute can be used in [cosmetics](/cosmetics "wikilink"),
[medicine](/medicine "wikilink"), [paints](/paints "wikilink"), and
other products.

## Features

[thumb\|right\|Picture of cutting lower part of the long jute fiber. The
lower part is hard fiber, which is called *jute cuttings* in Bangladesh
and India (commonly called *jute butts* or *jute tops* elsewhere). Jute
cuttings are lower in quality, but have commercial value for the paper,
carded yarn, and other fiber processing industries. Jute fibers are kept
in bundles in the background in a warehouse in
Bangladesh.](/File:cutting_jute.gif "wikilink")

-   Jute fiber is 100% bio-degradable and recyclable and thus
    environmentally friendly.
-   Jute has low pesticide and fertilizer needs.
-   It is a natural fiber with golden and silky shine and hence called
    *The Golden Fiber*.
-   It is the cheapest vegetable fiber procured from the bast or skin of
    the plant's stem.
-   It is the second most important vegetable fiber after cotton, in
    terms of usage, global consumption, production, and availability.
-   It has high tensile strength, low
    [extensibility](/extensibility "wikilink"), and ensures better
    [breathability](/Waterproof_fabric "wikilink") of fabrics.
    Therefore, jute is very suitable in agricultural commodity bulk
    packaging.
-   It helps to make top quality industrial yarn, fabric, net, and
    sacks. It is one of the most versatile natural fibers that has been
    used in raw materials for packaging, textiles, non-textile,
    construction, and agricultural sectors. Bulking of
    [yarn](/yarn "wikilink") results in a reduced breaking tenacity and
    an increased breaking extensibility when blended as a ternary blend.
-   The best source of jute in the world is the Bengal Delta Plain in
    the Ganges Delta, most of which is within the borders of Bangladesh.
-   Advantages of jute include good insulating and
    [antistatic](/static_electricity "wikilink") properties, as well as
    having low [thermal conductivity](/thermal_conductivity "wikilink")
    and a moderate [moisture regain](/moisture_regain "wikilink"). Other
    advantages of jute include [acoustic
    insulating](/Soundproofing "wikilink") properties and manufacture
    with no [skin irritations](/Irritation "wikilink").
-   Jute can be blended with other fibers, both synthetic and natural,
    and accepts cellulosic [dye](/dye "wikilink") classes such as
    [natural](/natural_dye "wikilink"), [basic](/basic_dye "wikilink"),
    [vat](/vat_dye "wikilink"), [sulfur](/Sulfur_dye "wikilink"),
    [reactive](/reactive_dye "wikilink"), and [pigment
    dyes](/dye "wikilink"). As demand for natural comfort fibers
    increases, demand for jute and other natural fibers that can be
    blended with cotton will increase. To meet this demand, some
    manufactures in the natural fiber industry plan to modernize
    processing with the [Rieter](/Rieter "wikilink")'s
    [Elitex](/Elitex "wikilink") system. Resulting jute/cotton yarns
    produce fabrics with a reduced cost of wet processing treatments.
    Jute can also be blended with wool. By treating jute with [caustic
    soda](/caustic_soda "wikilink"), crimp, softness, pliability, and
    appearance is improved, aiding in its ability to be spun with wool.
    Liquid [ammonia](/ammonia "wikilink") has a similar effect on jute,
    as well as the added characteristic of improving flame resistance
    when treated with [flameproofing](/fireproofing "wikilink") agents.
-   Some noted disadvantages include poor drapability and crease
    resistance, [brittleness](/brittleness "wikilink"), fiber shedding,
    and yellowing in sunlight. However, preparation of fabrics with
    [castor oil](/castor_oil "wikilink")
    [lubricants](/lubricant "wikilink") result in less yellowing and
    less fabric weight loss, as well as increased dyeing brilliance.
    Jute has a decreased strength when wet, and also becomes subject to
    [microbial](/Microorganism "wikilink") attack in humid climates.
    Jute can be processed with an [enzyme](/enzyme "wikilink") to reduce
    some of its brittleness and stiffness. Once treated with an enzyme,
    jute shows an affinity to readily accept natural dyes, which can be
    made from [marigold](/Asteraceae "wikilink") flower extract. In one
    attempt to dye jute fabric with this extract, bleached fabric was
    [mordanted](/mordant "wikilink") with [ferrous
    sulphate](/Iron(II)_sulfate "wikilink"), increasing the fabric's dye
    uptake value. Jute also responds well to [reactive
    dyeing](/reactive_dye "wikilink"). This process is used for bright
    and fast coloured value-added diversified products made from jute.
