**Kevlar** is a heat-resistant and strong [synthetic
fiber](synthetic_fiber "wikilink"), related to other
[aramids](aramid "wikilink") such as [Nomex](Nomex "wikilink") and
[Technora](Technora "wikilink"). Developed by [Stephanie
Kwolek](Stephanie_Kwolek "wikilink") at [DuPont](DuPont "wikilink") in
1965,[1][2][3] this high-strength material was used first commercially
in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires. Typically
it is spun into ropes or [fabric](fabric "wikilink") sheets that can be
used as such or as an ingredient in [composite
material](composite_material "wikilink") components.

Kevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle
[tires](tire "wikilink") and [racing sails](sailcloth#Kevlar "wikilink")
to [bulletproof vests](bulletproof_vest "wikilink"), because of its high
[tensile strength-to-weight ratio](Specific_strength "wikilink"); by
this measure it is five times stronger than steel.[4] It also is used to
make modern marching [drumheads](drumhead "wikilink") that withstand
high impact. When used as a woven material, it is suitable for mooring
lines and other underwater applications.

A similar fiber called [Twaron](Twaron "wikilink") with the same
chemical structure was developed by [Akzo](Akzo "wikilink") in the
1970s; commercial production started in 1986, and Twaron is now
manufactured by [Teijin](Teijin "wikilink").[5][6]

## History

![](Stephanie_Kwolek_Women_in_Chemistry_from_video.png "fig:Stephanie_Kwolek_Women_in_Chemistry_from_video.png"),
an American chemist of Polish origin \]\] Poly-paraphenylene
terephthalamide – branded Kevlar – was invented by Polish-American
chemist [Stephanie Kwolek](Stephanie_Kwolek "wikilink") while working
for DuPont, in anticipation of a gasoline shortage. In 1964, her group
began searching for a new lightweight strong fiber to use for light, but
strong, tires.[7] The polymers she had been working with at the time,
poly-p-phenylene-terephthalate and polybenzamide,[8] formed [liquid
crystal](liquid_crystal "wikilink") while in solution, something unique
to those polymers at the time.[9]

The solution was "cloudy, [opalescent](opalescent "wikilink") upon being
stirred, and of low [viscosity](viscosity "wikilink")" and usually was
thrown away. However, Kwolek persuaded the technician, Charles Smullen,
who ran the [spinneret](Spinneret_(polymers) "wikilink"), to test her
solution, and was amazed to find that the fiber did not break, unlike
[nylon](nylon "wikilink"). Her supervisor and her laboratory director
understood the significance of her discovery and a new field of [polymer
chemistry](polymer_chemistry "wikilink") quickly arose. By 1971, modern
Kevlar was introduced.[10] However, Kwolek was not very involved in
developing the applications of Kevlar.[11]

## Production

Kevlar is [synthesized](Chemical_synthesis "wikilink") in solution from
the monomers
1,4-[phenylene](phenylene "wikilink")-di[amine](amine "wikilink")
([*para*-phenylenediamine](P-Phenylenediamine "wikilink")) and
[terephthaloyl chloride](terephthaloyl_chloride "wikilink") in a
[condensation reaction](Condensation_polymer "wikilink") yielding
[hydrochloric acid](hydrochloric_acid "wikilink") as a byproduct. The
result has [liquid-crystalline](liquid_crystal "wikilink") behavior, and
mechanical drawing orients the polymer chains in the fiber's direction.
[Hexamethylphosphoramide](Hexamethylphosphoramide "wikilink") (HMPA) was
the solvent initially used for the
[polymerization](polymerization "wikilink"), but for safety reasons,
DuPont replaced it by a solution of *N*-methyl-pyrrolidone and calcium
chloride. As this process had been patented by Akzo (see above) in the
production of [Twaron](Twaron "wikilink"), a [patent
war](patent_war "wikilink") ensued.[12]

![](Poly(p-phenylenterephthalamid)-Synthese.svg "Poly(p-phenylenterephthalamid)-Synthese.svg")

Kevlar (poly paraphenylene terephthalamide) production is expensive
because of the difficulties arising from using concentrated [sulfuric
acid](sulfuric_acid "wikilink"), needed to keep the water-insoluble
polymer in solution during its synthesis and
[spinning](spinning_(textiles) "wikilink").

Several grades of Kevlar are available:


*Kevlar K-29* – in industrial applications, such as cables,
[asbestos](asbestos "wikilink") replacement, brake linings, and
body/vehicle armor.

*Kevlar K49* – high modulus used in cable and rope products.

*Kevlar K100* – colored version of Kevlar

*Kevlar K119* – higher-elongation, flexible and more fatigue resistant

*Kevlar K129* – higher tenacity for ballistic applications

*Kevlar AP* – 15% higher tensile strength than K-29[13]

*Kevlar XP* – lighter weight resin and KM2 plus fiber combination[14]

*[Kevlar KM2](Kevlar_KM2 "wikilink")* – enhanced ballistic resistance
for armor applications[15]

The [ultraviolet](Ultraviolet_light "wikilink") component of sunlight
degrades and decomposes Kevlar, a problem known as *[UV
degradation](UV_degradation "wikilink")*, and so it is rarely used
outdoors without protection against sunlight.[16]

## Structure and properties

![](Kevlar_chemical_structure_H-bonds.svg "fig:Kevlar_chemical_structure_H-bonds.svg")
unit, **dashed** lines indicate hydrogen bonds.\]\] When Kevlar is
[spun](spinneret_(polymers) "wikilink"), the resulting fiber has a
[tensile strength](tensile_strength "wikilink") of about 3,620 MPa,[17]
and a [relative density](relative_density "wikilink") of 1.44. The
polymer owes its high strength to the many inter-chain bonds. These
inter-molecular [hydrogen bonds](hydrogen_bonds "wikilink") form between
the carbonyl groups and N*H* centers. Additional strength is derived
from [aromatic stacking
interactions](aromatic_stacking_interaction "wikilink") between adjacent
strands. These interactions have a greater influence on Kevlar than the
[van der Waals](Van_der_Waals_bonding "wikilink") interactions and chain
length that typically influence the properties of other synthetic
polymers and fibers such as [Dyneema](Dyneema "wikilink"). The presence
of [salts](Salt_(chemistry) "wikilink") and certain other impurities,
especially [calcium](calcium "wikilink"), could interfere with the
strand interactions and care is taken to avoid inclusion in its
production. Kevlar's structure consists of relatively rigid molecules
which tend to form mostly planar sheet-like structures rather like
[silk](silk "wikilink") protein.[18]

## Thermal properties

Kevlar maintains its strength and resilience down to cryogenic
temperatures (−196 °C); in fact, it is slightly stronger at low
temperatures. At higher temperatures the tensile strength is immediately
reduced by about 10–20%, and after some hours the strength progressively
reduces further. For example: enduring 160 °C (320 °F) for 500 hours,
reduces strength by about 10%; and enduring 260 °C (500 °F) for 70
hours, reduces strength by about 50%.[19]

## Applications

### Protection

#### Cryogenics

Kevlar is often used in the field of [cryogenics](cryogenics "wikilink")
for its low [thermal conductivity](thermal_conductivity "wikilink") and
high strength relative to other materials for
[suspension](wiktionary:suspension "wikilink") purposes. It is most
often used to suspend a [paramagnetic](paramagnetic "wikilink") salt
enclosure from a [superconducting
magnet](superconducting_magnet "wikilink") mandrel in order to minimize
any heat leaks to the paramagnetic material. It is also used as a
thermal standoff or structural support where low heat leaks are desired.

#### Armor

![](Dunham_helmet.jpg "fig:Dunham_helmet.jpg") Kevlar is a well-known
component of [personal armor](personal_armor "wikilink") such as [combat
helmets](combat_helmet "wikilink"), [ballistic face
masks](ballistic_face_mask "wikilink"), and [ballistic
vests](ballistic_vest "wikilink"). The [PASGT helmet and
vest](Personnel_Armor_System_for_Ground_Troops "wikilink") used by
[United States](United_States "wikilink") military forces, use Kevlar as
a key component in their construction. Other military uses include
bulletproof face masks and [spall
liners](spall#Antitank_warfare "wikilink") used to protect the crews of
[armoured fighting vehicles](armoured_fighting_vehicle "wikilink").
[*Nimitz*-class aircraft
carriers](Nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier "wikilink") use Kevlar
reinforcement in vital areas. Civilian applications include: high heat
resistance uniforms worn by firefighters, body armour worn by police
officers, security, and police tactical teams such as
[SWAT](SWAT "wikilink").[20]

#### Personal protection

Kevlar is used to manufacture gloves, sleeves, jackets,
[chaps](chaps "wikilink") and other articles of clothing[21] designed to
protect users from cuts, abrasions and heat. Kevlar-based protective
gear is often considerably lighter and thinner than equivalent gear made
of more traditional materials.[22]

### Sports

![](Kevlar_canoe_algonquin.JPG "Kevlar_canoe_algonquin.JPG")

#### Personal protection

It is used for [motorcycle safety
clothing](motorcycle_safety_clothing "wikilink"), especially in the
areas featuring padding such as shoulders and elbows. In
[fencing](fencing "wikilink") it is used in the protective jackets,
breeches, plastrons and the bib of the masks. It is increasingly being
used in the *peto*, the padded covering which protects the
[picadors](picador "wikilink")' horses in the bullring. [Speed
skaters](Speed_skating "wikilink") also frequently wear an under-layer
of Kevlar fabric to prevent potential wounds from skates in the event of
a fall or collision.

#### Equipment

In *[kyudo](kyudo "wikilink")*, or Japanese
[archery](archery "wikilink"), it may be used as an alternative to more
expensive[23] [hemp](hemp "wikilink") for [bow
strings](bow_string "wikilink"). It is one of the main materials used
for [paraglider](paraglider "wikilink") suspension lines.[24] It is used
as an inner lining for some [bicycle tires](bicycle_tire "wikilink") to
prevent punctures. In [table tennis](table_tennis "wikilink"), plies of
Kevlar are added to custom ply blades, or paddles, in order to increase
bounce and reduce weight. [Tennis racquets](Tennis_racquets "wikilink")
are sometimes strung with Kevlar. It is used in sails for high
performance racing boats.

#### Shoes

In 2013, with advancements in technology, [Nike](Nike,_Inc "wikilink")
used Kevlar in shoes for the first time. It launched the Elite II
Series,[25] with enhancements to its earlier version of [basketball
shoes](basketball_shoe "wikilink") by using Kevlar in the
[anterior](Welt_(shoe) "wikilink") as well as the [shoe
laces](shoe_lace "wikilink"). This was done to decrease the elasticity
of the tip of the shoe in contrast to nylon used conventionally as
Kevlar expanded by about 1% against nylon which expanded by about 30%.
Shoes in this range included LeBron, HyperDunk and Zoom Kobe VII.
However these shoes were launched at a price range much higher than
average cost of basketball shoes. It was also used in the laces for the
[Adidas](Adidas "wikilink") F50 adiZero Prime football boot.

#### Cycle tires

Several companies, including [Continental
AG](Continental_AG "wikilink"), manufacture cycle tires with Kevlar to
protect against punctures.[26]

Folding-bead bicycle tires, introduced to cycling by [Tom
Ritchey](Tom_Ritchey "wikilink") in 1984,[27] use Kevlar as a bead in
place of steel for weight reduction and strength. A side effect of the
folding bead is a reduction in shelf and floor space needed to display
cycle tires in a retail environment, as they are folded and placed in
small boxes.

### Music

#### Audio equipment

Kevlar has also been found to have useful acoustic properties for
[loudspeaker](loudspeaker "wikilink") cones, specifically for bass and
mid range drive units.[28] Additionally, Kevlar has been used as a
[strength member](strength_member "wikilink") in fiber optic cables such
as the ones used for audio data transmissions.[29]

#### Bowed string instruments

Kevlar can be used as an acoustic core on bows for [string
instruments](string_instruments "wikilink").[30] Kevlar's physical
properties provide strength, flexibility, and stability for the bow's
user. To date, the only manufacturer of this type of bow is
[CodaBow](CodaBow "wikilink").[31]

Kevlar is also presently used as a material for tailcords (a.k.a.
tailpiece adjusters), which connect the
[tailpiece](tailpiece "wikilink") to the [endpin](endpin "wikilink") of
bowed string instruments.[32]

#### Drumheads

Kevlar is sometimes used as a material on marching snare drums. It
allows for an extremely high amount of tension, resulting in a cleaner
sound. There is usually a resin poured onto the Kevlar to make the head
airtight, and a nylon top layer to provide a flat striking surface. This
is one of the primary types of marching snare drum heads.
[Remo](Remo "wikilink")'s Falam Slam patch is made with Kevlar and is
used to reinforce bass drum heads where the beater strikes.[33]

#### Woodwind reeds

Kevlar is used in the [woodwind](Woodwind_instrument "wikilink") reeds
of Fibracell. The material of these reeds is a composite of aerospace
materials designed to duplicate the way nature constructs cane reed.
Very stiff but sound absorbing Kevlar fibers are suspended in a
lightweight resin formulation.[34]

### Motor vehicles

#### Chassis and bodywork

Kevlar is sometimes used in structural components of cars, especially
high-value performance cars such as the [Ferrari
F40](Ferrari_F40 "wikilink")[35]

#### Brakes

The chopped fiber has been used as a replacement for asbestos in [brake
pads](brake_pad "wikilink").[36] Indeed, aramids release a lower level
of airborne fibres than [asbestos](asbestos "wikilink") brakes. Asbestos
fibres are known for their carcinogenic properties.[37]

### Other uses

#### Fire dancing

![](Fire_Dancing_Golden_Gate_Bridge.jpg "fig:Fire_Dancing_Golden_Gate_Bridge.jpg")\]\]
Wicks for [fire dancing](fire_dancing "wikilink") props are made of
composite materials with Kevlar in them. Kevlar by itself does not
absorb fuel very well, so it is blended with other materials such as
[fiberglass](fiberglass "wikilink") or [cotton](cotton "wikilink").
Kevlar's high heat resistance allows the wicks to be reused many times.

#### Frying pans

Kevlar is sometimes used as a substitute for [Teflon](Teflon "wikilink")
in some non-stick frying pans.[38]

#### Rope, cable, sheath

![](US_Navy_111203-N-WJ771-066_Seaman_Apprentice_Luis_Silva_repairs_a_Kevlar_mooring_line_on_the_forecastle_of_the_forward-deployed_amphibious_dock_lan.jpg "fig:US_Navy_111203-N-WJ771-066_Seaman_Apprentice_Luis_Silva_repairs_a_Kevlar_mooring_line_on_the_forecastle_of_the_forward-deployed_amphibious_dock_lan.jpg")\]\]
The fiber is used in woven rope and in cable, where the fibers are kept
parallel within a [polyethylene](polyethylene "wikilink") sleeve. The
cables have been used in [suspension
bridges](suspension_bridge "wikilink") such as the bridge at
[Aberfeldy](Aberfeldy,_Scotland "wikilink") in
[Scotland](Scotland "wikilink"). They have also been used to stabilize
cracking concrete cooling towers by circumferential application followed
by tensioning to close the cracks. Kevlar is widely used as a protective
outer sheath for [optical fiber cable](optical_fiber_cable "wikilink"),
as its strength protects the cable from damage and kinking. When used in
this application it is commonly known by the trademarked name
Parafil.[39]

#### Electricity generation

Kevlar was used by scientists at [Georgia Institute of
Technology](Georgia_Institute_of_Technology "wikilink") as a base
textile for an experiment in electricity-producing clothing. This was
done by weaving [zinc oxide](zinc_oxide "wikilink")
[nanowires](nanowire "wikilink") into the fabric. If successful, the new
fabric will generate about 80 milliwatts per square meter.[40]

#### Building construction

A retractable roof of over 60,000 square feet (5,575 square metres) of
Kevlar was a key part of the design of [Montreal's Olympic
stadium](Olympic_Stadium_(Montreal) "wikilink") for the [1976 Summer
Olympics](1976_Summer_Olympics "wikilink"). It was spectacularly
unsuccessful, as it was completed 10 years late and replaced just 10
years later in May 1998 after a series of problems.[41][42]

#### Expansion joints and hoses

Kevlar can be found as a reinforcing layer in
[rubber](rubber "wikilink") [bellows](bellows "wikilink") [expansion
joints](expansion_joints "wikilink") and rubber
[hoses](hose_(tubing) "wikilink"), for use in high temperature
applications, and for its high strength. It is also found as a braid
layer used on the outside of hose assemblies, to add protection against
sharp objects.[43][44][45]

#### Particle physics

A thin Kevlar window has been used by the [NA48
experiment](NA48_experiment "wikilink") at [CERN](CERN "wikilink") to
separate a vacuum vessel from a vessel at nearly atmospheric pressure,
both 192 cm in diameter. The window has provided vacuum tightness
combined with reasonably small amount of material (only 0.3% to 0.4% of
[radiation length](radiation_length "wikilink")).

#### Smartphones

The [Motorola RAZR Family](Droid_RAZR "wikilink"), the [Motorola Droid
Maxx](Droid_Maxx "wikilink"), and the [OnePlus 2](OnePlus_2 "wikilink")
have a Kevlar backplate, chosen over other materials such as carbon
fiber due to its resilience and lack of interference with signal
transmission.[46]

#### Marine current turbines and wind turbines

The Kevlar fiber/epoxy matrix composite materials can be used in marine
current turbines (MCT) or wind turbines due to their high specific
strength and light weight compared to other fibers.[47]

## Composite materials

Aramid fibers are widely used for reinforcing composite materials, often
in combination with [carbon fiber](carbon_fiber "wikilink") and [glass
fiber](glass_(fiber) "wikilink"). The matrix for high performance
composites is usually [epoxy resin](epoxy_resin "wikilink"). Typical
applications include [monocoque](monocoque "wikilink") bodies for F1
[racing cars](racing_car "wikilink"),
[helicopter](helicopter "wikilink") rotor blades,
[tennis](tennis "wikilink"), [table tennis](table_tennis "wikilink"),
[badminton](badminton "wikilink") and
[squash](squash_(sport) "wikilink") [rackets](racquet "wikilink"),
[kayaks](kayak "wikilink"), [cricket](cricket "wikilink") bats, and
[field hockey](field_hockey "wikilink"), [ice
hockey](ice_hockey "wikilink") and [lacrosse](lacrosse "wikilink")
sticks.[48][49][50][51]

Kevlar is an alternative in certain parts of light aircraft
construction. The wing leading edge is one application, Kevlar being
less prone than carbon or glass fiber to break in bird collision.
