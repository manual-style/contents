M.54.21.4a-b\]\] **Kidskin** or **kid leather** is a type of soft, thin
[leather](leather "wikilink") that is traditionally used for
[gloves](glove "wikilink") (hence the phrase '[kid
gloves](wikt:kid_gloves "wikilink"),' used since at least 1888 as a
metaphor for careful handling).[1] It is widely used for other fashion
purposes such as footwear and clothing. Kidskin is traditionally made
from [goatskin](goatskin_(material) "wikilink") - more specifically, the
skin of young [goats](goat "wikilink") (or 'kids'), although equivalent
leathers such as [lambskin](sheepskin "wikilink") and chickenskin
(actually a form of [calfskin](calfskin "wikilink")) give the same
effect.[2]

## Usage

Kid leather is, and has been used for a number of purposes other than
gloves and footwear. Early flexible [hair
rollers](hair_roller "wikilink") were sometimes made from kidskin,
giving a very tight curl.[3]

### Papermaking

While [vellum](vellum "wikilink") is often made using calfskin, kidskin
can also be used and in some cases, was preferred. [David Laurent de
Lara](David_Laurent_de_Lara "wikilink"), describing himself as
[illuminating artist](limner "wikilink") to [Queen
Victoria](Queen_Victoria "wikilink"), favoured Italian kid vellum for
his work.[4]

A form of early medieval parchment, called *carta lustra*, acting as
[tracing paper](tracing_paper "wikilink") was made using kidskin.[5]

### Dolls

Kid was particularly widely used in doll-making during the nineteenth
and early twentieth century as a popular material for both French and
German doll bodies, particularly [fashion
dolls](fashion_doll "wikilink").[6][7]

### Musical instruments

Kid-leather is often used in the construction of musical instruments
such as the bag of the [tsampouna](tsampouna "wikilink"), a form of
Greek [bagpipes](bagpipes "wikilink").[8] It was also an option for
[drumheads](drumhead "wikilink") such as those on
[tambourines](tambourine "wikilink"),[9] and specifically, on the
Bulgarian [daire](dayereh "wikilink").[10]

### Industrial uses

The [Dalén light](Dalén_light "wikilink"), used in lighthouses, uses a
paraffin-wax saturated kidskin
[diaphragm](Diaphragm_(mechanical_device) "wikilink") in its
construction.[11]

## Types

In 1916 it was noted that there were over sixty types of goatskin,
distinguished by the [tanning](Tanning_(leather) "wikilink") and
finishing processes used.[12] Some of these types are:

-   *Bronze kid* - [Cochineal](Cochineal "wikilink")-dyed for a
    [bronzed](bronze "wikilink") finish.[13]
-   *Cadet kid*[14]
-   *Cheveril* - A very flexible kid leather used in the late 16th and
    early 17th centuries.[15]
-   *Diphera* - Mid-19th century type of fine kid used for
    [bonnets](bonnet_(headgear) "wikilink").[16][17]
-   *Dongola* - Skin from the sheep, kangaroo or goat.[18]
-   *French kid* - A high quality kidskin.[19]
-   *Glacé (or glazed) kid* - Extremely glossy, shiny finish, often made
    in more readily available sheepskin, although true kidskin makes
    better quality glacé kid.[20]
-   *Gold (or silver) kid* - Kidskin [gilded](gilded "wikilink") for a
    metallic finish.[21]
-   *Kangaroo kid* - Kidskin finished to emulate
    [kangaroo](kangaroo "wikilink") leather.[22]
-   *Mat kid* - Beeswax and olive-oil treated kidskin with a dull, soft
    matte finish.[23][24]
-   *[Morocco](Morocco_leather "wikilink")*[25]
-   *[Patent](Patent_leather "wikilink") kid* -
    [japanned](Japanning "wikilink") leather.[26]
-   *Pebbled*[27]
-   *Royal kid*[28]
-   *[Suede](Suede "wikilink") kid* - Kidskin with a suede finish.[29]
-   *Vici kid* - A trademark for high quality chrome-tanned kidskin with
    a soap and oil finish, developed by Robert Foederer in Philadelphia
    in the mid-1880s.[30]
