![](leathertools.jpg "fig:leathertools.jpg") **Leather** is a durable
and flexible material created by [tanning](Tanning_(leather) "wikilink")
animal [rawhide](Rawhide_(textile) "wikilink") and skins. The most
common raw material is [cattle](cattle "wikilink") hide. It can be
produced at manufacturing scales ranging from
[artisan](artisan "wikilink") to modern [industrial
scale](heavy_industry "wikilink").

Leather is used to make a variety of articles, including footwear,
automobile seats, clothing, bags, book bindings, fashion accessories,
and furniture. It is produced in a wide variety of types and styles and
decorated by a wide range of techniques. The earliest record of leather
artifacts dates back to 2200 BC.

The leather manufacturing process is divided into three fundamental
subprocesses: preparatory stages, tanning, and crusting. A further
subprocess, finishing, can be added into the leather process sequence,
but not all leathers receive finishing.

The preparatory stages are when the hide is prepared for tanning.
Preparatory stages may include: soaking, hair removal,
[liming](liming_(leather_processing) "wikilink"),
[deliming](deliming "wikilink"), bating,
[bleaching](bleaching "wikilink"), and [pickling](pickling "wikilink").

[Tanning](Tanning_(leather) "wikilink") is a process that stabilizes the
[proteins](protein "wikilink"), particularly
[collagen](collagen "wikilink"), of the raw hide to increase the
thermal, chemical and microbiological stability of the hides and skins,
making it suitable for a wide variety of end applications. The principal
difference between raw and tanned hides is that raw hides dry out to
form a hard, inflexible material that, when rewetted, will putrefy,
while tanned material dries to a flexible form that does not become
putrid when rewetted.

Many tanning methods and materials exist. The typical process sees
tanners load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a tank that
contains the tanning "liquor". The hides soak while the drum slowly
rotates about its axis, and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through
the full thickness of the hide. Once the process achieves even
penetration, workers slowly raise the liquor's pH in a process called
basification, which fixes the tanning material to the leather. The more
tanning material fixed, the higher the leather's hydrothermal stability
and [shrinkage](Shrinkage_(fabric) "wikilink") temperature resistance.

Crusting is a process that thins and lubricates leather. It often
includes a coloring operation. Chemicals added during crusting must be
fixed in place. Crusting culminates with a drying and softening
operation, and may include splitting, shaving,
[dyeing](dyeing "wikilink"),
[whitening](Whitening_(leather_processing) "wikilink") or other methods.

For some leathers, tanners apply a surface coating, called "finishing".
Finishing operations can include oiling, brushing, buffing, coating,
polishing, embossing, [glazing](Glaze_(painting_technique) "wikilink"),
or [tumbling](Tumble_finishing "wikilink"), among others.

Leather can be oiled to improve its water resistance. This
[currying](currying_(leather) "wikilink") process after tanning
supplements the natural oils remaining in the leather itself, which can
be washed out through repeated exposure to water. Frequent oiling of
leather, with [mink oil](mink_oil "wikilink"), [neatsfoot
oil](neatsfoot_oil "wikilink"), or a similar material keeps it supple
and improves its lifespan dramatically.[1]

### Tanning methods

Tanning processes largely differ in which chemicals are used in the
tanning liquor. Some common types include:

-   **** is tanned using [tannins](tannin "wikilink") extracted from
    [vegetable matter](vegetable_matter "wikilink"), such as tree
    [bark](tanbark "wikilink") prepared in [bark
    mills](bark_mill "wikilink"). It is the oldest known method. It is
    supple and light brown in color, with the exact shade depending on
    the mix of materials and the color of the skin. The [color
    tan](tan_(color) "wikilink") derives its name from the appearance of
    undyed vegetable-tanned leather. Vegetable-tanned leather is not
    stable in water; it tends to discolor, and if left to soak and then
    dry, it shrinks and becomes harder. This is a feature of
    vegetable-tanned leather that is exploited in traditional
    shoemaking. In hot water, it shrinks drastically and partly
    congeals, becoming rigid and eventually brittle. [Boiled
    leather](Boiled_leather "wikilink") is an example of this, where the
    leather has been hardened by being immersed in hot water, or in
    boiled [wax](wax "wikilink") or similar substances. Historically, it
    was occasionally used as [armor](armor "wikilink") after hardening,
    and it has also been used for [book
    binding](book_binding "wikilink").
-   **Chrome-tanned leather**, invented in 1858, is tanned using
    [chromium sulfate](Chromium_(III)_sulfate "wikilink") and other
    [chromium](chromium "wikilink") [salts](salt_(chemistry) "wikilink")
    . It is also known as "wet blue" for the pale blue color of the
    undyed leather. The chrome tanning method usually takes
    approximately one day to complete, making it best suited for
    large-scale industrial use. This is the most common method in modern
    use. It is more supple and pliable than vegetable-tanned leather and
    does not discolor or lose shape as drastically in water as
    vegetable-tanned. However, there are environmental concerns with
    this tanning method, as chromium is a heavy metal.
-   **Aldehyde-tanned leather** is tanned using
    [glutaraldehyde](glutaraldehyde "wikilink") or
    [oxazolidine](oxazolidine "wikilink") compounds. It is referred to
    as "wet white" due to its pale cream color. It is the main type of
    "chrome-free" leather, often seen in shoes for infants and
    automobiles. [Formaldehyde](Formaldehyde "wikilink") has been used
    for tanning in the past; it is being phased out due to danger to
    workers and sensitivity of many people to formaldehyde.
    -   **[Chamois leather](Chamois_leather "wikilink")** is a form of
        aldehyde tanning that produces a porous and highly
        water-absorbent leather. Chamois leather is made using marine
        oils (traditionally cod oil) that oxidize to produce the
        aldehydes that tan the leather.
-   **Brain tanned leathers** are made by a labor-intensive process that
    uses emulsified oils, often those of animal brains such as deer,
    cattle, and buffalo. They are known for their exceptional softness
    and washability.
-   **Alum leather** is transformed using
    [aluminium](aluminium "wikilink") salts mixed with a variety of
    binders and [protein](protein "wikilink") sources, such as flour and
    egg yolk. Alum leather is not actually tanned; rather the process is
    called "tawing", and the resulting material reverts to rawhide if
    soaked in water long enough to remove the alum salts.

## Grades

In general, leather is produced in the following grades:

-   **Top-grain leather** includes the outer layer of the hide, known as
    the grain, which features finer, more densely packed fibers,
    resulting in strength and durability. Depending on thickness, it may
    also contain some of the more fibrous under layer, known as the
    corium. Types of top-grain leather include:
    -   **Full-grain leather** contains the entire grain layer, without
        any removal of the surface. Rather than wearing out, it develops
        a [patina](patina "wikilink") during its useful lifetime. It is
        usually considered the highest quality leather. Furniture and
        footwear are often made from full-grain leather. Full-grain
        leather is typically finished with a soluble
        [aniline](Aniline_leather "wikilink") dye. [Russia
        leather](Russia_leather "wikilink") is a form of full-grain
        leather.
    -   **Corrected grain leather** has the surface subjected to
        finishing treatments to create a more uniform appearance. This
        usually involves buffing or sanding away flaws in the grain,
        then dyeing and embossing the surface.
    -   **[Nubuck](Nubuck "wikilink")** is top-grain leather that has
        been sanded or buffed on the grain side to give a slight nap of
        short protein fibers, producing a velvet-like surface.
-   **Split leather** is created from the corium left once the top-grain
    has been separated from the hide, known as the drop split. In
    thicker hides, the drop split can be further split into a middle
    split and a flesh split.
    -   **[Suede](Suede "wikilink")** is made from the underside of a
        split to create a soft, napped finish. It is often made from
        younger or smaller animals, as the skins of adults often result
        in a coarse, shaggy nap.
    -   **[Bicast leather](Bicast_leather "wikilink")** is split leather
        that has a polyurethane or vinyl layer applied to the surface
        and embossed to give it the appearance of a grain. It is
        slightly stiffer than top-grain leather but has a more
        consistent texture.
    -   **[Patent leather](Patent_leather "wikilink")** is leather that
        has been given a high-gloss finish by the addition of a coating.
        Dating to the late 1700s, it became widely popular after
        inventor [Seth Boyden](Seth_Boyden "wikilink") developed the
        first mass-production process, using a linseed-oil-based
        lacquer, in 1818. Modern versions are usually a form of bicast
        leather.
-   **[Bonded leather](Bonded_leather "wikilink")**, also called
    *reconstituted leather*, is a material that uses leather scraps that
    are shredded and bonded together with polyurethane or
    [latex](latex "wikilink") onto a fiber mesh. The amount of leather
    fibers in the mix varies from 10% to 90%, affecting the properties
    of the product.[2]

## From other animals

![](«PhoneCases».png "fig:«PhoneCases».png")\]\] Today, most leather is
made of [cattle](cattle "wikilink") hides, which constitute about 65% of
all leather produced. Other animals that are used include sheep, about
13%, goats, about 11%, and pigs, about 10%. Obtaining accurate figures
from around the world is difficult, especially for areas where the skin
may be eaten.[3][4] Other animals mentioned below only constitute a
fraction of a percent of total leather production.

Horse hides are used to make particularly durable leathers. [Shell
cordovan](Shell_cordovan "wikilink") is a horse leather made not from
the outer skin but an under layer found only in equine species called
the shell. It is prized for its mirror-like finish and anti-creasing
properties.

Lamb and deerskin are used for soft leather in more expensive apparel.
Deerskin is widely used in work gloves and indoor shoes.

Reptilian skins, such as [alligator](Alligator_leather "wikilink"),
crocodile, and [snake](snakeskin "wikilink"), are noted for their
distinct patterns that reflect the scales of their species. This has led
to hunting and farming of these species in part for their skins.

[Kangaroo leather](Kangaroo_leather "wikilink") is used to make items
that must be strong and flexible. It is the material most commonly used
in [bullwhips](bullwhip "wikilink"). Some
[motorcyclists](motorcycle "wikilink") favor kangaroo leather for
[motorcycle leathers](Motorcycle_safety_clothing#Leathers "wikilink")
because of its light weight and abrasion resistance.[5] Kangaroo leather
is also used for falconry jesses, soccer footwear,[6] and boxing speed
bags.[7]

Although originally raised for their feathers in the 19th century,
[ostriches](ostrich "wikilink") are now more popular for both meat and
leather.[8] [Ostrich leather](Ostrich_leather "wikilink") has a
characteristic "goose bump" look because of the large follicles where
the feathers grew. Different processes produce different finishes for
many applications, including upholstery, footwear, automotive products,
accessories, and clothing.

In [Thailand](Thailand "wikilink"), [stingray](stingray "wikilink")
leather is used in wallets and belts. Stingray leather is tough and
durable. The leather is often dyed black and covered with tiny round
bumps in the natural pattern of the back ridge of an animal. These bumps
are then usually dyed white to highlight the decoration. Stingray
rawhide is also used as grips on Chinese swords, Scottish basket hilted
swords, and Japanese [katanas](katana "wikilink"). Stingray leather is
also used for high abrasion areas in motorcycle racing leathers
(especially in gloves, where its high abrasion resistance helps prevent
wear through in the event of an accident.)

For a given thickness, fish leather is typically much stronger due to
its criss-crossed fibers.[9]

## Environmental impact

Leather produces some environmental impact, most notably due to:

-   The carbon footprint of cattle rearing
-   Use of chemicals in the tanning process (e.g.,
    [chromium](chromium "wikilink"), [phthalate
    esters](phthalate "wikilink"), [nonyl phenol ethoxylate
    soaps](nonoxynols "wikilink"),
    [pentachlorophenol](pentachlorophenol "wikilink") and
    [solvents](solvent "wikilink"))
-   Air pollution due to the transformation process ([hydrogen
    sulfide](hydrogen_sulfide "wikilink") is formed during mixing with
    acids and [ammonia](ammonia "wikilink") liberated during deliming,
    solvent vapors)

### Carbon footprint

One estimate of the [carbon footprint](carbon_footprint "wikilink") of
leather goods is 0.51 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per £1 of output
at 2010 retail prices, or 0.71 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq per £1 of output at
2010 industry prices.[10]

### Water footprint

One ton of hide or skin generally produces 20 to 80 m<sup>3</sup> of
waste water, including chromium levels of 100–400 mg/l, sulfide levels
of 200–800 mg/l, high levels of fat and other solid wastes, and notable
pathogen contamination. Producers often add pesticides to protect hides
during transport. With solid wastes representing up to 70% of the wet
weight of the original hides, the tanning process represents a
considerable strain on water treatment installations.[11]

### Disposal

Leather [biodegrades](biodegrade "wikilink") slowly—taking 25 to 40
years to [decompose](decompose "wikilink").[12] However, vinyl and
petrochemical-derived materials take 500 or more years to decompose.[13]

### Chemical waste disposal

![](Rajasthani_style_Leather_Jooti,local_artwork_Jaipur_India.jpg "fig:Rajasthani_style_Leather_Jooti,local_artwork_Jaipur_India.jpg"),
Jaipur, India\]\] Tanning is especially polluting in countries where
environmental regulations are lax, such as in India, the world's
third-largest producer and exporter of leather. To give an example of an
efficient pollution prevention system, chromium loads per produced tonne
are generally abated from 8 kg to 1.5 kg.
[VOC](Volatile_organic_compounds "wikilink") emissions are typically
reduced from 30 kg/t to 2 kg/t in a properly managed facility. A review
of the total pollution load decrease achievable according to the [United
Nations Industrial Development
Organization](United_Nations_Industrial_Development_Organization "wikilink")[14]
posts precise data on the abatement achievable through industrially
proven low-waste advanced methods, while noting, "even though the chrome
pollution load can be decreased by 94% on introducing advanced
technologies, the minimum residual load 0.15 kg/t raw hide can still
cause difficulties when using landfills and composting sludge from
wastewater treatment on account of the regulations currently in force in
some countries."

In [Kanpur](Kanpur "wikilink"), the self-proclaimed "Leather City of
World"—with 10,000 tanneries as of 2011 and a city of three million on
the banks of the [Ganges](Ganges "wikilink")—pollution levels were so
high, that despite an industry crisis, the pollution control board
decided to shut down 49 high-polluting tanneries out of 404 in July
2009.[15] In 2003 for instance, the main tanneries' effluent disposal
unit was dumping 22 tonnes of chromium-laden solid waste per day in the
open.[16]

In the Hazaribagh neighborhood of Dhaka in
[Bangladesh](Bangladesh "wikilink"), chemicals from tanneries end up in
Dhaka's main river. Besides the environmental damage, the health of both
local factory workers and the end consumer is also negatively
affected.[17] After approximately 15 years of ignoring high court
rulings, the government shut down more than 100 tanneries the weekend of
8 April 2017 in the neighborhood.[18]

The higher cost associated with the treatment of effluents than to
untreated effluent discharging leads to illegal dumping to save on
costs. For instance, in [Croatia](Croatia "wikilink") in 2001, proper
pollution abatement cost US$70–100 per ton of raw hides processed
against $43/t for irresponsible behavior.[19] In November 2009, one of
Uganda's main leather making companies was caught directly dumping waste
water into a wetland adjacent to [Lake
Victoria](Lake_Victoria "wikilink").[20]

## Role of enzymes

[Enzymes](Enzyme "wikilink") like [proteases](protease "wikilink"),
[lipases](lipase "wikilink"), and [amylases](amylase "wikilink") have an
important role in the soaking, dehairing, degreasing, and bating
operations of leather manufacturing. Proteases are the most commonly
used enzymes in leather production. The enzyme must not damage or
dissolve [collagen](collagen "wikilink") or
[keratin](keratin "wikilink"), but should hydrolyze
[casein](casein "wikilink"), [elastin](elastin "wikilink"),
[albumin](albumin "wikilink"), [globulin](globulin "wikilink")-like
proteins, and nonstructural proteins that are not essential for leather
making. This process is called bating.[21]

Lipases are used in the degreasing operation to hydrolyze fat particles
embedded in the skin.[22]

Amylases are used to soften skin, to bring out the grain, and to impart
strength and flexibility to the skin. These enzymes are rarely used.

## Preservation and conditioning

The natural fibers of leather break down with the passage of time.
Acidic leathers are particularly vulnerable to [red
rot](red_rot "wikilink"), which causes powdering of the surface and a
change in consistency. Damage from red rot is aggravated by high
temperatures and relative humidities. Although it is chemically
irreversible, treatments can add handling strength and prevent
disintegration of red rotted leather.

Exposure to long periods of low relative humidities (below 40%) can
cause leather to become desiccated, irreversibly changing the fibrous
structure of the leather. Chemical damage can also occur from exposure
to environmental factors, including ultraviolet light, ozone, acid from
sulfurous and nitrous pollutants in the air, or through a chemical
action following any treatment with tallow or oil compounds. Both
oxidation and chemical damage occur faster at higher temperatures.

Various treatments are available such as
[conditioners](Conditioner_(chemistry) "wikilink"). [Saddle
soap](Saddle_soap "wikilink") is used for cleaning, conditioning, and
softening leather. Leather shoes are widely conditioned with [shoe
polish](shoe_polish "wikilink").[23]

## In modern culture

Due to its excellent resistance to abrasion and wind, leather found a
use in rugged occupations. The enduring image of a
[cowboy](cowboy "wikilink") in leather [chaps](chaps "wikilink") gave
way to the leather-jacketed and leather-helmeted
[aviator](aviator "wikilink"). When [motorcycles](motorcycle "wikilink")
were invented, some riders took to wearing heavy leather
[jackets](jackets "wikilink") to protect from [road
rash](road_rash "wikilink") and wind blast; some also wear chaps or full
leather pants to protect the lower body.

Leather's flexibility allows it to be formed and shaped into balls and
protective gear. Subsequently, many sports use equipment made from
leather, such as [baseball gloves](baseball_glove "wikilink") and the
[ball](Ball_(gridiron_football) "wikilink") used in [American
football](American_football "wikilink").

[Leather fetishism](Leather_fetishism "wikilink") is the name popularly
used to describe a [fetishistic](sexual_fetishism "wikilink") attraction
to people wearing leather, or in certain cases, to the garments
themselves.

Many [rock groups](rock_group "wikilink") (particularly [heavy
metal](Heavy_Metal_music "wikilink") and
[punk](punk_subculture "wikilink") groups in the 1980s) are well known
for wearing leather clothing. [Extreme metal](Extreme_metal "wikilink")
bands (especially [black metal](black_metal "wikilink") bands) and [Goth
rock](Goth_rock "wikilink") groups have extensive [black
leather](black_leather "wikilink") clothing. Leather has become less
common in the punk community over the last three decades, as there is
opposition to the use of leather from [punks who support animal
rights](Punk_ideologies#Animal_rights_and_veganism "wikilink").

Many cars and trucks come with optional or standard leather or "leather
faced" seating.

## Religious sensitivities

In countries with significant populations of individuals observing
religions which place restrictions on material choices, leather vendors
typically clarify the kinds of leather in their products. For example,
leather shoes bear a label that identifies the animal from which the
leather came. This helps a [Muslim](Muslim "wikilink") not accidentally
purchase pigskin, and a [Hindu](Hindu "wikilink") to avoid cattleskin,
this is to adhere to religious observance and respect. Many vegetarian
Hindus do not use any kind of leather. Such [taboos](taboo "wikilink")
increase the demand for religiously neutral leathers such as
[ostrich](ostrich "wikilink") and [deer](deer "wikilink").

[Judaism](Judaism "wikilink") forbids the comfort of wearing leather
shoes on [Yom Kippur](Yom_Kippur "wikilink"), [Tisha
B'Av](Tisha_B'Av "wikilink"), and during mourning.[24] Also, see
[Teffilin](Tefillin "wikilink") and [Torah
Scroll](Sefer_Torah "wikilink").

[Jainism](Jainism "wikilink") prohibits the use of leather, since it is
obtained by killing animals.

## Alternatives

Many forms of [artificial leather](artificial_leather "wikilink") have
been developed, usually involving polyurethane or vinyl coatings applied
to a cloth backing. Many names and brands for such artificial leathers
exist, including "pleather", a portmanteau of "plastic leather", and the
brand name [Naugahyde](Naugahyde "wikilink").[25]

Another alternative is cultured leather which is lab-grown using [cell
culture](cell_culture "wikilink") methods.[26][27]
