A **material** is the building block of clothing and accessories and the
most basic element of clothes in the fashion system. Although it cannot
be readily worn in its original state, the material in its manufactured
form makes up a [garment](/Garments "wikilink") or an
[accessory](/Accessories "wikilink"), which in turn makes up an
[outfit](/Outfits "wikilink"). It is comprised of a wide range of
natural and synthetic resources, including fibers, hides, fabrics,
textiles, metals and plastics. The selection of materials vary greatly
depending on the [person](/People "wikilink") who designs, produces and
wears the garment, the [scene](/Scenes "wikilink") in which it is made
into garments and worn, as well the preferences of
[style](/Styles "wikilink") and [theme](/Themes "wikilink") by different
people and regions.
