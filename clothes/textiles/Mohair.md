**Mohair** is a [fabric](textile "wikilink") or [yarn](yarn "wikilink")
made from the hair of the [Angora goat](Angora_goat "wikilink") (not to
be confused with the [Angora rabbit](Angora_rabbit "wikilink") which
produces [Angora wool](Angora_wool "wikilink")). Both durable and
resilient, mohair is notable for its high luster and sheen,[1] which has
helped gain it the nickname the "Diamond Fiber",[2] and is often used in
fiber blends to add these qualities to a textile. Mohair takes
[dye](dye "wikilink") exceptionally well. It feels warm in winter as it
has excellent insulating properties, while remaining cool in summer due
to its moisture-wicking properties. It is durable, naturally elastic,
flame-resistant and crease-resistant. It is considered a luxury fiber,
like [cashmere](cashmere_wool "wikilink"),
[angora](angora_wool "wikilink") and silk, and can be more expensive
than most [wool](wool "wikilink") that is produced by sheep.

Mohair is composed mostly of [keratin](keratin "wikilink"), a protein
found in the hair, wool, horns and skin of all
[mammals](mammals "wikilink"), but mohair's special properties are
unique to the Angora goat. While it has scales like wool, the scales are
not fully developed, merely indicated.[3] Thus, mohair does not
[felt](felt "wikilink") in the same way wool does.

Mohair fiber is approximately 25–45
[microns](Wool_measurement "wikilink") in
[diameter](diameter "wikilink").[4] It increases in diameter with the
age of the goat, growing along with the animal. Finer, softer hair from
younger animals is used (for example) in scarves and shawls; the
thicker, coarser hair from older animals is more often used for
[carpets](carpet "wikilink") and in heavy fabrics intended for
outerwear.

The term *mohair* is sometimes used to describe a type of material used
for the folding roof on [convertible](Convertible_(car) "wikilink")
cars. In this instance, *mohair* refers to a form of
[denim](denim "wikilink")-like [canvas](canvas "wikilink").

## Production

![](Mohair_sign,_Camp_Wood,_TX_IMG_1326.JPG "fig:Mohair_sign,_Camp_Wood,_TX_IMG_1326.JPG"),
including the [Real County](Real_County,_Texas "wikilink") community of
[Camp Wood](Camp_Wood,_Texas "wikilink").\]\]

[Shearing](Sheep_shearing "wikilink") is done twice a year, in the
spring and in the fall. One goat will produce of mohair a year. Shearing
is done on a cleanly-swept floor and extra care is taken to keep the
hair clean and free of debris. The hair is then processed to remove
natural grease, dirt and vegetable matter. Mohair grows in uniform
locks. The Angora goat is a single-coat breed, and unlike
[pygora](Pygora_Goat "wikilink") or
[cashmere](cashmere_goat "wikilink"), there is no need to dehair a
mohair fleece to separate the coarse hair from the down hair.

[South Africa](South_Africa "wikilink") is the world's largest mohair
producer as of 2013, supplying around 50% of the total world
production.[5] Due to animal cruelty in the South African farms, Zara,
H&M, Gap, Topshop, [Lacoste](Lacoste "wikilink"), and many more[6] will
no longer sell Mohair clothing.[7]

## History

Specials](The_Specials "wikilink") wearing a two-tone suit, so called
because the mohair fabric changes color from grey to purple\]\]

Mohair is one of the oldest textile fibers in use. The Angora goat is
thought to originate from the mountains of [Tibet](Tibet "wikilink"),
reaching [Turkey](Turkey "wikilink") in the 16th century. However,
fabric made of mohair was known in England as early as the 8th
century.[8] The word "mohair" was adopted into English sometime before
1570 from the [Arabic](Arabic_language "wikilink"): *mukhayyar*,[9] a
type of haircloth, literally 'choice', from *khayyara*, 'he chose'.[10]

In about 1820, raw mohair was first exported from Turkey to England,
which then became the leading manufacturer of mohair products. The
[Yorkshire](Yorkshire "wikilink") mills spun yarn that was exported to
[Russia](Russia "wikilink"), Germany, [Austria](Austria "wikilink"),
etc., as well as woven directly in Yorkshire.[11]

Until 1849, the Turkish province of Ankara was the sole producer of
Angora goats. [Charles V](Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "wikilink") is
believed to be the first to bring Angora goats to Europe. Due to the
great demand for mohair fiber, throughout the 1800s there was a great
deal of crossbreeding between Angora goats and common goats. The growing
demand for mohair further resulted in attempts on a commercial scale to
introduce the goat into [South Africa](South_Africa "wikilink") (where
it was crossed with the native goat) in 1838, the United States in 1849,
[Australia](Australia "wikilink") from 1856–1875, and later still [New
Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink").[12] In 1849, Angora goats made their
way to America as a gift from Turkey.

During the [1960s](1960s_in_fashion "wikilink"), a blend of mohair and
wool suiting fabric known as Tonik or Tonic was developed in England.
This had a shiny, color changing appearance and was popular among [rude
boys](rude_boy "wikilink") and the [mod
subculture](mod_subculture "wikilink").[13] Similar suits were worn by
[mod revivalists](mod_revival "wikilink"),
[skinheads](skinhead "wikilink"), and fans of [ska
punk](ska_punk "wikilink") and [Two Tone
music](Two_Tone_music "wikilink") during the [early to
mid-1980s](1980s_in_fashion "wikilink").[14][15]

Today, South Africa is the largest mohair producer in the world, with
the majority of South African mohair being produced in the [Eastern
Cape](Eastern_Cape "wikilink"). The United States is the second-largest
producer, with the majority of American mohair being produced in
[Texas](Texas "wikilink"). Turkey also produces good-quality mohair.
Because the goats are sheared once a year (different than South Africa),
Turkey produces the longest mohair of the world.

In December 2006, the [General Assembly of the United
Nations](General_Assembly_of_the_United_Nations "wikilink") proclaimed
2009 to be the [International Year of Natural
Fibres](International_Year_of_Natural_Fibres "wikilink"), so as to raise
the profile of mohair and other [natural
fibers](natural_fiber "wikilink").

Mohair is used in scarves, winter hats, suits, sweaters, coats, socks
and home furnishing. Mohair fiber is also found in carpets, wall
fabrics, craft yarns, and many other fabrics, and may be used as a
substitute for fur. Because its texture resembles fine human hair,
mohair is often used in making high grade [doll](doll "wikilink")
[wigs](Wig_(hair) "wikilink") or in rooting customized dolls.

Mohair is a very soft yarn when compared with other natural and
synthetic fibers. Due to mohair lacking prominent, protruding scales
along the hair's surface, it is often blended with wool or alpaca.
Blending the heavily scaled wool helps the smooth mohair fibers hold
their shape and stick together when spun into yarn. Mohair is also
valued for certain other unique characteristics: it is warmer than other
fibers, even when used to make a light-weight garment, and is often
blended with wool for this reason; and mohair fibers have a distinctive
luster created by the way they reflect light. Combined with mohair's
ability to absorb dyes exceptionally well, pure mohair yarns are usually
recognizable for their vivid saturated colours.

Fibers from young goats are softest and are used to manufacture yarn for
clothing. Fibers from mature goats are used to produce such things as
rugs and carpets.[16] Mohair is also used in ['climbing
skins'](Ski_skins "wikilink") for [randonnée
skiing](Ski_mountaineering "wikilink") and [ski
touring](ski_touring "wikilink"). The mohair is used in a carpet
allowing the skier an appropriate ascension method without sliding
downhill.

## Mohair industry worldwide

As of 2009, world output of mohair was estimated at around 5,000 tonnes
a year, down from a high of 25,000 tonnes in the 1990s. South Africa
accounts for 60% of total production. South African mohair is generally
exported raw or semi-processed to textile makers in Europe, the UK and
the Far East.[17] Prices for adult mohair declined in 2010 while prices
for kid mohair remained the same. An emerging market for mohair
producers has been China.[18]

## US subsidies for mohair production

During [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), U.S. soldiers wore
uniforms made of [wool](wool "wikilink"). Worried that domestic
producers could not supply enough for future wars, Congress enacted loan
and price support programs for wool and mohair in the [National Wool Act
of 1954](National_Wool_Act_of_1954 "wikilink") as part of the [1954 Farm
Bill](1954_Farm_Bill "wikilink").[19] Despite these subsidies, wool and
mohair production declined. The strategic importance declined as well;
the US military adopted uniforms made of synthetic fibers, such as
[dacron](dacron "wikilink"), and officially removed wool from the list
of [strategic materials](strategic_material "wikilink") in 1960.[20]
Nevertheless, the U.S. government continued to provide subsidies to
mohair producers until 1995, when the subsidies were "eliminated
effective with the marketing year ending December 31, 1995".[21] In
*[The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and
Abroad](The_Future_of_Freedom "wikilink")*[22] [Fareed
Zakaria](Fareed_Zakaria "wikilink") points out that the subsidies were
reinstated a few years later, due in large part to the lobbying on
behalf of the special interests of the subsidy recipients. By 2000,
Congress had appropriated US$20 million for goat and sheep
producers.[23] As of 2002, mohair producers were still able to receive
special assistance loans from the U.S. government, after an amendment to
eliminate the subsidy was defeated.[24] The U.S. currently subsidizes
mohair production under the [Marketing Assistance Loan
Program](Marketing_Assistance_Loan_Program "wikilink") of the [2014 Farm
Act](2014_Farm_Act "wikilink").[25]
