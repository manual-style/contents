**Nylon** is a generic designation for a family of [synthetic
polymers](synthetic_polymer "wikilink"), based on
[aliphatic](aliphatic "wikilink") or
[semi-aromatic](Aromaticity "wikilink")
[polyamides](polyamide "wikilink"). Nylon is a
[thermoplastic](thermoplastic "wikilink") silky material[1] that can be
melt-processed into fibers, [films](Thin_film "wikilink"), or shapes.[2]
It is made of [repeating units](polymer "wikilink") linked by amide
links[3] similar to the [peptide bonds](peptide_bond "wikilink") in
[proteins](protein "wikilink"). Nylon polymers can be mixed with a wide
variety of additives to achieve many different property variations.
Nylon polymers have found significant commercial applications in
[fabric](fabric "wikilink") and fibers (apparel, flooring and rubber
reinforcement), in shapes (molded parts for cars, electrical equipment,
etc.), and in films (mostly for food packaging).[4]

Nylon was the first commercially successful synthetic
[thermoplastic](thermoplastic "wikilink") polymer.[5]
[DuPont](DuPont_(1802–2017) "wikilink") began its research project in
1927.[6] The first example of nylon ([nylon 6,6](Nylon_66 "wikilink"))
was produced using [diamines](diamine "wikilink") on February 28, 1935,
by [Wallace Hume Carothers](Wallace_Hume_Carothers "wikilink") at
DuPont's research facility at the [DuPont Experimental
Station](DuPont_Experimental_Station "wikilink").[7][8] In response to
Carothers' work, [Paul Schlack](Paul_Schlack "wikilink") at [IG
Farben](IG_Farben "wikilink") developed [nylon 6](nylon_6 "wikilink"), a
different molecule based on [caprolactam](caprolactam "wikilink"), on
January 29, 1938.[9][10]

Nylon was first used commercially in a
nylon-[bristled](bristle "wikilink") [toothbrush](toothbrush "wikilink")
in 1938,[11][12] followed more famously in women's
[stockings](stocking "wikilink") or "nylons" which were shown at the
[1939 New York World's Fair](1939_New_York_World's_Fair "wikilink") and
first sold commercially in 1940.[13] During World War II, almost all
nylon production was diverted to the military for use in
[parachutes](parachutes "wikilink") and [parachute
cord](parachute_cord "wikilink"). Wartime uses of nylon and other
[plastics](plastics "wikilink") greatly increased the market for the new
materials.[14]

## History

![](Wallace_Carothers,_in_the_lab.jpg "fig:Wallace_Carothers,_in_the_lab.jpg")\]\]

### DuPont and the invention of Nylon

DuPont, founded by [Éleuthère Irénée du
Pont](Éleuthère_Irénée_du_Pont "wikilink"), first produced gunpowder and
later cellulose-based paints. Following [WWI](World_War_I "wikilink"),
DuPont produced synthetic [ammonia](ammonia "wikilink") and other
chemicals. DuPont began experimenting with the development of cellulose
based fibers, eventually producing the synthetic fiber
[rayon](rayon "wikilink"). DuPont's experience with rayon was an
important precursor to its development and marketing of nylon.[15]

DuPont's invention of nylon spanned an eleven-year period, ranging from
the initial research program in polymers in 1927 to its announcement in
1938, shortly before the opening of the 1939 [New York World's
Fair](1939_New_York_World's_Fair "wikilink").[16] The project grew from
a new organizational structure at DuPont, suggested by [Charles
Stine](Charles_Stine "wikilink") in 1927, in which the chemical
department would be composed of several small research teams that would
focus on "pioneering research" in chemistry and would "lead to practical
applications".[17] Harvard instructor Wallace Hume Carothers was hired
to direct the polymer research group. Initially he was allowed to focus
on pure research, building on and testing the theories of German chemist
[Hermann Staudinger](Hermann_Staudinger "wikilink").[18] He was very
successful, as research he undertook greatly improved the knowledge of
polymers and contributed to science.[19]

In the spring of 1930, Carothers and his team had already synthesized
two new polymers. One was [neoprene](neoprene "wikilink"), a synthetic
rubber greatly used during World War II.[20] The other was a white
elastic but strong paste that would later become nylon. After these
discoveries, Carothers' team was made to shift its research from a more
pure research approach investigating general polymerization to a more
practically-focused goal of finding "one chemical combination that would
lend itself to industrial applications".[21]

It wasn't until the beginning of 1935 that a polymer called "polymer
6-6" was finally produced. Carothers' coworker, [Washington
University](Washington_University_in_St._Louis "wikilink") alumnus
[Julian W. Hill](Julian_W._Hill "wikilink") had used a [cold
drawing](Drawing_(manufacturing)#Plastic%20drawing "wikilink") method to
produce a [polyester](polyester "wikilink") in 1930.[22] This cold
drawing method was later used by Carothers in 1935 to fully develop
nylon.[23] The first example of nylon (nylon 6,6) was produced on
February 28, 1935, at DuPont's research facility at the DuPont
Experimental Station.[24] It had all the desired properties of
elasticity and strength. However, it also required a complex
manufacturing process that would become the basis of industrial
production in the future. DuPont obtained a patent for the polymer in
September 1938,[25] and quickly achieved a monopoly of the fiber.[26]
Carothers died 16 months before the announcement of nylon, therefore he
was never able to see his success. [27]

The production of nylon required interdepartmental collaboration between
three departments at DuPont: the Department of Chemical Research, the
Ammonia Department, and the Department of Rayon. Some of the key
ingredients of nylon had to be produced using [high pressure
chemistry](high_pressure_chemistry "wikilink"), the main area of
expertise of the Ammonia Department. Nylon was considered a “godsend to
the Ammonia Department”,[28] which had been in financial difficulties.
The reactants of nylon soon constituted half of the Ammonia department's
sales and helped them come out of the period of the [Great
Depression](Great_Depression "wikilink") by creating jobs and revenue at
DuPont.[29]

DuPont's nylon project demonstrated the importance of [chemical
engineering](chemical_engineering "wikilink") in industry, helped create
jobs, and furthered the advancement of chemical engineering techniques.
In fact, it developed a chemical plant that provided 1800 jobs and used
the latest technologies of the time, which are still used as a model for
chemical plants today.[30] The ability to acquire a large number of
chemists and engineers quickly was a huge contribution to the success of
DuPont's nylon project.[31] The first nylon plant was located at
Seaford, Delaware, beginning commercial production on December 15, 1939.
On October 26, 1995, the Seaford plant was designated a [National
Historic Chemical
Landmark](National_Historic_Chemical_Landmark "wikilink") by the
[American Chemical Society](American_Chemical_Society "wikilink").[32]

### Early marketing strategies

An important part of nylon's popularity stems from DuPont's marketing
strategy. DuPont promoted the fiber to increase demand before the
product was available to the general market. Nylon's commercial
announcement occurred on October 27, 1938, at the final session of the
*[Herald Tribune](New_York_Herald_Tribune "wikilink")*{{'}}s yearly
"Forum on Current Problems", on the site of the approaching New York
City world's fair.[33][34] The "first man-made organic textile fiber"
which was derived from "coal, water and air" and promised to be "as
strong as steel, as fine as the spider's web" was received
enthusiastically by the audience, many of them middle-class women, and
made the headlines of most newspapers.[35] Nylon was introduced as part
of "The world of tomorrow" at the 1939 New York World's Fair[36] and was
featured at DuPont's "Wonder World of Chemistry" at the [Golden Gate
International
Exposition](Golden_Gate_International_Exposition "wikilink") in San
Francisco in 1939.[37][38] Actual nylon stockings were not shipped to
selected stores in the national market until May 15, 1940. However, a
limited number were released for sale in Delaware before that.[39] The
first public sale of nylon stockings occurred on October 24, 1939, in
Wilmington, Delaware. 4,000 pairs of stockings were available, all of
which were sold within three hours.[40]

Another added bonus to the campaign was that it meant reducing silk
imports from Japan, an argument that won over many wary customers. Nylon
was even mentioned by [President
Roosevelt](Franklin_D._Roosevelt "wikilink")'s cabinet, which addressed
its "vast and interesting economic possibilities" five days after the
material was formally announced.[41]

However, the early excitement over nylon also caused problems. It fueled
unreasonable expectations that nylon would be better than silk, a
miracle fabric as strong as steel that would last forever and never
run.[42][43] Realizing the danger of claims such as "New Hosiery Held
Strong as Steel" and "No More Runs", DuPont scaled back the terms of the
original announcement, especially those stating that nylon would possess
the strength of steel.[44]

Also, DuPont executives marketing nylon as a revolutionary man-made
material did not at first realize that some consumers experienced a
sense of unease and distrust, even fear, towards synthetic fabrics.[45]
A particularly damaging news story, drawing on DuPont's 1938 patent for
the new polymer, suggested that one method of producing nylon might be
to use [cadaverine](cadaverine "wikilink") (pentamethylenediamine), a
chemical extracted from corpses. Although scientists asserted that
cadaverine was also extracted by heating coal, the public often refused
to listen. A woman confronted one of the lead scientists at DuPont and
refused to accept that the rumour was not true.[46]

DuPont changed its campaign strategy, emphasizing that nylon was made
from "coal, air and water", and started focusing on the personal and
aesthetic aspects of nylon, rather than its intrinsic qualities.[47]
Nylon was thus domesticated,[48] and attention shifted to the material
and consumer aspect of the fiber with slogans like "If it's nylon, it's
prettier, and oh! How fast it dries!".[49]

### Production of nylon fabric

![](NMA.0028271,_Fashion_Photo_by_Erik_Liljeroth_1954.jpg "fig:NMA.0028271,_Fashion_Photo_by_Erik_Liljeroth_1954.jpg"),
[Sweden](Sweden "wikilink"), in 1954\]\] After nylon's nationwide
release in 1940, production was increased. 1300 tons of the fabric were
produced during 1940.[50] During their first year on the market, 64
million pairs of nylon stockings were sold.[51] In 1941, a second plant
was opened in [Martinsville,
Virginia](Martinsville,_Virginia "wikilink") due to the success of the
fabric.[52]

![](Particolare_di_calza_di_nylon.jpg "Particolare_di_calza_di_nylon.jpg")

![](Nylon_fibre_SEM.tif "fig:Nylon_fibre_SEM.tif")\]\]

While nylon was marketed as the durable and indestructible material of
the people, it was sold at almost twice the price of
[silk](silk "wikilink") stockings ($4.27 per pound of nylon versus $2.79
per pound of silk).[53] Sales of nylon stockings were strong in part due
to changes in women's fashion. As Lauren Olds explains: "by 1939
\[hemlines\] had inched back up to the knee, closing the decade just as
it started off". The shorter skirts were accompanied by a demand for
stockings that offered fuller coverage without the use of garters to
hold them up.[54]

However, as of February 11, 1942, nylon production was redirected from
being a consumer material to one used by the military.[55] DuPont's
production of nylon stockings and other lingerie stopped, and most
manufactured nylon was used to make parachutes and tents for [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink").[56] Although nylon stockings already made
before the war could be purchased, they were generally sold on the black
market for as high as $20.[57]

Once the war ended, the return of nylon was awaited with great
anticipation. Although DuPont projected yearly production of 360 million
pairs of stockings, there were delays in converting back to consumer
rather than wartime production.[58] In 1946, the demand for nylon
stockings could not be satisfied, which led to the [Nylon
riots](Nylon_riots "wikilink"). In one case, an estimated 40,000 people
lined up in Pittsburgh to buy 13,000 pairs of nylons.[59] In the
meantime, women cut up nylon tents and parachutes left from the war in
order to make blouses and wedding dresses.[60][61] Between the end of
the war and 1952, production of stockings and lingerie used 80% of the
world's nylon. DuPont put a lot of focus on catering to the civilian
demand, and continually expanded its production.

### Introduction of nylon blends

As pure nylon hosiery was sold in a wider market, problems became
apparent. Nylon stockings were found to be fragile, in the sense that
the thread often tended to unravel lengthwise, creating 'runs'.[62]
People also reported that pure nylon textiles could be uncomfortable due
to nylon's lack of absorbency.[63] Moisture stayed inside the fabric
near the skin under hot or moist conditions instead of being "wicked"
away.[64] Nylon fabric could also be itchy, and tended to cling and
sometimes spark as a result of static electrical charge built up by
friction.[65][66] Also, under some conditions stockings could
decompose[67] turning back into nylon's original components of air,
coal, and water. Scientists explained this as a result of air pollution,
attributing it to London smog in 1952, as well as poor air quality in
New York and Los Angeles.[68][69][70]

The solution found to problems with pure nylon fabric was to blend nylon
with other existing fibers or polymers such as
[cotton](cotton "wikilink"), [polyester](polyester "wikilink"), and
[spandex](spandex "wikilink"). This led to the development of a wide
array of blended fabrics. The new nylon blends retained the desirable
properties of nylon (elasticity, durability, ability to be dyed) and
kept clothes prices low and affordable.[71] As of 1950, the New York
Quartermaster Procurement Agency (NYQMPA), which developed and tested
textiles for the army and navy, had committed to developing a wool-nylon
blend. They were not the only ones to introduce blends of both natural
and synthetic fibers. *America's Textile Reporter* referred to 1951 as
the "Year of the blending of the fibers".[72] Fabric blends included
mixes like "Bunara" (wool-rabbit-nylon) and "Casmet"
(wool-nylon-fur).[73] In Britain in November 1951, the inaugural address
of the 198th session of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures and Commerce focused on the blending of textiles.[74]

DuPont's Fabric Development Department cleverly targeted French fashion
designers, supplying them with fabric samples. In 1955, designers such
as [Coco Chanel](Coco_Chanel "wikilink"), [Jean
Patou](Jean_Patou "wikilink"), and [Christian
Dior](Christian_Dior "wikilink") showed gowns created with DuPont
fibers, and fashion photographer [Horst P.
Horst](Horst_P._Horst "wikilink") was hired to document their use of
DuPont fabrics.[75] *American Fabrics* credited blends with providing
"creative possibilities and new ideas for fashions which had been
hitherto undreamed of."[76]

## Origin of the name

DuPont went through an extensive process to generate names for its new
product.[77] In 1940, John W. Eckelberry of DuPont stated that the
letters "nyl" were arbitrary and the "on" was copied from the suffixes
of other fibers such as [cotton](cotton "wikilink") and Rayon. A later
publication by DuPont (*Context*, vol. 7, no. 2, 1978) explained that
the name was originally intended to be "No-Run" ("run" meaning
"unravel"), but was modified to avoid making such an unjustified claim.
Since the products were not really run-proof, the vowels were swapped to
produce "nuron", which was changed to "nilon" "to make it sound less
like a nerve tonic". For clarity in pronunciation, the "i" was changed
to "y."[78][79]

## Longer-term popularity

In spite of oil shortages in the 1970s, consumption of nylon textiles
continued to grow by 7.5 per cent per annum between the 1960s and
1980s.[80] Overall production of synthetic fibers, however, dropped from
63% of the worlds textile production in 1965, to 45% of the world's
textile production in early 1970s.[81] The appeal of "new" technologies
wore off, and nylon fabric "was going out of style in the 1970s".[82]
Also, consumers became concerned about environmental costs throughout
the production cycle: obtaining the raw materials (oil), energy use
during production, waste produced during creation of the fiber, and
eventual waste disposal of materials that were not biodegradable.[83]
Synthetic fibers have not dominated the market since the 1950s and
1960s. , nylon continued to represent about 12% (8 million pounds) of
the world's production of synthetic fibers.[84] As one of the largest
engineering polymer families, the global demand of nylon resins and
compounds was valued at roughly US$20.5 billion in 2013. The market is
expected to reach US$30 billion by 2020 by following an average annual
growth of 5.5%.[85]

Although pure nylon has many flaws and is now rarely used, its
derivatives have greatly influenced and contributed to society. From
scientific discoveries relating to the production of plastics and
polymerization, to economic impact during the depression and the
changing of women's fashion, nylon was a revolutionary product.[86] The
[Lunar Flag Assembly](Lunar_Flag_Assembly "wikilink"), the first flag
planted on the moon in a symbolic gesture of celebration, was made of
nylon. The flag itself cost $5.50, but had to have a specially-designed
flagpole with a horizontal bar so that it would appear to "fly".[87][88]
One historian describes nylon as "an object of desire", comparing the
invention to Coca-Cola in the eyes of 20th century consumers.[89]

## Chemistry

Nylons are [condensation polymers](condensation_polymer "wikilink") or
[copolymers](copolymer "wikilink"), formed by reacting difunctional
monomers containing equal parts of [amine](amine "wikilink") and
[carboxylic acid](carboxylic_acid "wikilink"), so that
[amides](amide "wikilink") are formed at both ends of each monomer in a
process analogous to [polypeptide](polypeptide "wikilink")
[biopolymers](biopolymer "wikilink"). Most nylons are made from the
reaction of a [dicarboxylic acid](dicarboxylic_acid "wikilink") with a
diamine (e.g. PA66) or a lactam or amino acid with itself (e.g.
PA6).[90] In the first case, the "repeating unit" consists of one of
each monomer, so that they alternate in the chain, similar to the
so-called ABAB structure of [polyesters](polyester "wikilink") and
[polyurethanes](polyurethane "wikilink"). Since each monomer in this
copolymer has the same [reactive group](functional_group "wikilink") on
both ends, the direction of the [amide bond](peptide_bond "wikilink")
reverses between each monomer, unlike natural
[polyamide](polyamide "wikilink") [proteins](protein "wikilink"), which
have overall directionality: [C terminal](carboxyl "wikilink") →
[N terminal](amino "wikilink"). In the second case (so called AA), the
repeating unit corresponds to the single monomer.[91][92]

### Nomenclature

In common usage, the prefix "PA" ([polyamide](polyamide "wikilink")) or
the name "Nylon" are used interchangeably and are equivalent in meaning.

The nomenclature used for nylon polymers was devised during the
synthesis of the first simple aliphatic nylons and uses numbers to
describe the number of carbons in each monomer unit, including the
carbon(s) of the carboxylic acid(s).[93][94] Subsequent use of cyclic
and aromatic monomers required the use of letters or sets of letters.
One number after "PA" or "Nylon" indicates a
[homopolymer](homopolymer "wikilink") which is *monadic* or based on one
amino acid (minus H<sub>2</sub>O) as monomer:


PA 6 or Nylon 6: \[NH−(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>−CO\]<sub>n</sub> made
from ε-Caprolactam.

Two numbers or sets of letters indicate a *dyadic* homopolymer formed
from two monomers: one diamine and one dicarboxylic acid. The first
number indicates the number of carbons in the diamine. The two numbers
should be separated by a comma for clarity, but the comma is often
omitted.


PA or Nylon 6,10 (or 610) :
\[NH−(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>−NH−CO−(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>8</sub>−CO\]<sub>n</sub>
made from [hexamethylenediamine](hexamethylenediamine "wikilink") and
[sebacic acid](sebacic_acid "wikilink");

For copolymers the comonomers or pairs of comonomers are separated by
slashes:


PA 6/66 :
\[NH-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>−NH−CO−(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>−CO\]<sub>n</sub>−\[NH−(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>−CO\]<sub>m</sub>
made from caprolactam, hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid ;

PA 66/610 :
\[NH−(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>−NH−CO−(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>−CO\]<sub>n</sub>−\[NH−(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>−NH−CO−(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>8</sub>−CO\]<sub>m</sub>
made from hexamethylenediamine, adipic acid and sebacic acid.

The term [polyphthalamide](polyphthalamide "wikilink") (abbreviated to
PPA) is used when 60% or more moles of the carboxylic acid portion of
the repeating unit in the polymer chain is composed of a combination of
[terephthalic acid](terephthalic_acid "wikilink") (TPA) and [isophthalic
acid](isophthalic_acid "wikilink") (IPA).

### Types of nylon

#### Nylon 66

Wallace Carothers at DuPont patented [nylon 66](nylon_66 "wikilink")
using amides.[95][96][97] In the case of nylons that involve reaction of
a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid, it is difficult to get the
proportions exactly correct, and deviations can lead to chain
termination at molecular weights less than a desirable 10,000
[daltons](atomic_mass_unit "wikilink")
([u](unified_atomic_mass_unit "wikilink")). To overcome this problem, a
[crystalline](crystal "wikilink"), solid "nylon
[salt](Salt_(chemistry) "wikilink")" can be formed at [room
temperature](room_temperature "wikilink"), using an exact 1:1
[ratio](ratio "wikilink") of the [acid](acid "wikilink") and the
[base](Base_(chemistry) "wikilink") to neutralize each other. The salt
is crystallized to purify it and obtain the desired precise
stoichiometry. Heated to 285 °C (545 °F), the salt reacts to form nylon
polymer with the production of water.

#### Nylon 6

The synthetic route using lactams (cyclic amides) was developed by [Paul
Schlack](Paul_Schlack "wikilink") at [IG Farben](IG_Farben "wikilink"),
leading to nylon 6, or [polycaprolactam](caprolactam "wikilink") —
formed by a [ring-opening
polymerization](ring-opening_polymerization "wikilink"). The peptide
bond within the caprolactam is broken with the exposed [active
groups](functional_group "wikilink") on each side being incorporated
into two new bonds as the monomer becomes part of the polymer backbone.

The 428 °F (220 °C) melting point of nylon 6 is lower than the 509 °F
(265 °C) melting point of [nylon 66](nylon_66 "wikilink").[98]

#### Nylon 510

Nylon 510, made from [pentamethylene
diamine](pentamethylene_diamine "wikilink") and sebacic acid, was
studied by Carothers even before nylon 66 and has superior properties,
but is more expensive to make. In keeping with this naming convention,
"nylon 6,12" or "PA 612" is a copolymer of a 6C diamine and a 12C
diacid. Similarly for PA 510 PA 611; PA 1012, etc. Other nylons include
copolymerized dicarboxylic acid/diamine products that are *not* based
upon the monomers listed above. For example, some fully
[aromatic](aromatic "wikilink") nylons (known as
"[aramids](aramids "wikilink")") are polymerized with the addition of
diacids like terephthalic acid (→ [Kevlar](Kevlar "wikilink"),
[Twaron](Twaron "wikilink")) or isophthalic acid (→
[Nomex](Nomex "wikilink")), more commonly associated with polyesters.
There are copolymers of PA 66/6; copolymers of PA 66/6/12; and others.
In general linear polymers are the most useful, but it is possible to
introduce branches in nylon by the condensation of dicarboxylic acids
with [polyamines](polyamine "wikilink") having three or more [amino
groups](amino_group "wikilink").

The general reaction is:
![centre](Condensation_polymerization_diacid_diamine.svg "fig:centre")

Two molecules of [water](water_(molecule) "wikilink") are given off and
the nylon is formed. Its properties are determined by the R and R'
groups in the monomers. In nylon 6,6, R = 4C and R' = 6C
[alkanes](alkane "wikilink"), but one also has to include the two
carboxyl [carbons](carbon "wikilink") in the diacid to get the number it
donates to the chain. In Kevlar, both R and R' are
[benzene](benzene "wikilink") rings.

Industrial synthesis is usually done by heating the acids, amines or
lactams to remove water, but in the laboratory, diacid chlorides can be
reacted with diamines. For example, a popular demonstration of
interfacial polymerization (the "[nylon rope
trick](nylon_rope_trick "wikilink")") is the synthesis of nylon 66 from
[adipoyl chloride](adipoyl_chloride "wikilink") and hexamethylene
diamine.

#### Nylon 1,6

Nylons can also be synthesized from dinitriles using acid catalysis. For
example, this method is applicable for preparation of [nylon
1,6](nylon_1,6 "wikilink") from [adiponitrile](adiponitrile "wikilink"),
[formaldehyde](formaldehyde "wikilink") and water.[99] Additionally,
nylons can be synthesized from [diols](diol "wikilink") and dinitriles
using this method as well.[100]

### Monomers

cases from crude oil but sometimes from biomass. Those in current
production are described below.

    [m-xylene](m-xylene "wikilink") → isophthalic acid

#### Diamines

Various diamine components can be used, which are derived from a variety
of sources. Most are [petrochemicals](petrochemical "wikilink"), but
[bio-based materials](bio-based_material "wikilink") are also being
developed.

-   Tetramethylene diamine ([putrescine](putrescine "wikilink")): Crude
    oil → [propylene](propylene "wikilink") →
    [acrylonitrile](acrylonitrile "wikilink") →
    [succinonitrile](succinonitrile "wikilink") → tetramethylene diamine

-   1,5-pentanediamine ([cadaverine](cadaverine "wikilink")) (PMD):
    [starch](starch "wikilink") (e.g. [cassava](cassava "wikilink")) →
    [glucose](glucose "wikilink") → [lysine](lysine "wikilink") →
    PMD.[104]

### Polymers

Due to the large number of diamines, diacids and aminoacids that can be
synthesized, many nylon polymers have been made experimentally and
characterized to varying degrees. A smaller number have been scaled up
and offered commercially, and these are detailed below.

#### Homopolymers

Homopolymer nylons derived from one monomer

| Monomer                 | Polymer                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|

| 11-aminoundecanoic acid | [11](Nylon_11 "wikilink") |

have been offered commercially either as homopolymers or as a part of a
copolymer.

Commercial homopolymer polyamides

Examples of these polymers that are or were commercially available

-   PA46 DSM Stanyl[108]
-   PA410 DSM Ecopaxx[109]
-   PA4T DSM Four Tii[110]
-   PA66 DuPont Zytel[111]

#### Copolymers

It is easy to make mixtures of the monomers or sets of monomers used to
make nylons to obtain copolymers. This lowers
[crystallinity](crystallinity "wikilink") and can therefore lower the
melting point.

Some copolymers that have been or are commercially available are listed
below:

-   PA6/66 DuPont Zytel[112]
-   PA6/6T BASF Ultramid T (6/6T copolymer)[113]
-   PA6I/6T DuPont Selar PA[114]
-   PA66/6T DuPont Zytel HTN[115]
-   PA12/MACMI EMS Grilamid TR[116]

#### Blends

Most nylon polymers are miscible with each other allowing a range of
blends to be made. The two polymers can react with one another by
transamidation to form random copolymers.[117]

According to their crystallinity, polyamides can be:

-   semi-[crystalline](crystal "wikilink"):
    -   high crystallinity: PA46 and PA66;
    -   low crystallinity: PAMXD6 made from m-xylylenediamine and adipic
        acid;
-   [amorphous](Amorphous_solid "wikilink"): PA6I made from
    hexamethylenediamine and isophthalic acid.

According to this classification, PA66, for example, is an aliphatic
semi-crystalline homopolyamide.

### Hydrolysis and degradation

All nylons are susceptible to [hydrolysis](hydrolysis "wikilink"),
especially by [strong acids](strong_acid "wikilink"), a reaction
essentially the reverse of the synthetic reaction shown above. The
[molecular weight](molecular_weight "wikilink") of nylon products so
attacked drops, and cracks form quickly at the affected zones. Lower
members of the nylons (such as nylon 6) are affected more than higher
members such as nylon 12. This means that nylon parts cannot be used in
contact with [sulfuric acid](sulfuric_acid "wikilink") for example, such
as the electrolyte used in [lead–acid
batteries](Lead–acid_battery "wikilink").

When being molded, nylon must be dried to prevent hydrolysis in the
molding machine barrel since water at high temperatures can also degrade
the polymer.[118] The reaction is of the type:


![Image:amide
hydrolysis.svg](amide_hydrolysis.svg "fig:Image:amide hydrolysis.svg")

### Environmental impact, incineration and recycling

Berners-Lee calculates the average [greenhouse gas
footprint](GHG_footprint "wikilink") of nylon in manufacturing carpets
at 5.43 kg CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per kg, when produced in Europe.
This gives it almost the same carbon footprint as
[wool](wool "wikilink"), but with greater durability and therefore a
lower overall carbon footprint.[119]

Data published by PlasticsEurope indicates for nylon 66 a [greenhouse
gas footprint](GHG_footprint "wikilink") of 6.4 kg CO<sub>2</sub>
equivalent per kg, and an energy consumption of 138 kJ/kg.[120] When
considering the environmental impact of nylon, it is important to
consider the use phase. In particular when cars are lightweight,
significant savings in fuel consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are
achieved.

Various nylons break down in fire and form hazardous smoke, and toxic
fumes or ash, typically containing [hydrogen
cyanide](hydrogen_cyanide "wikilink").
[Incinerating](Incineration "wikilink") nylons to recover the high
energy used to create them is usually expensive, so most nylons reach
the garbage dumps, decaying slowly. Discarded nylon fabric takes 30–40
years to decompose.[121] Nylon is a robust polymer and lends itself well
to recycling. Much nylon resin is recycled directly in a closed loop at
the injection molding machine, by grinding sprues and runners and mixing
them with the virgin granules being consumed by the molding
machine.[122] Aquafil has demonstrated recycling fishing nets lost in
the ocean into apparel [123]

## Bulk properties

Above their [melting
temperatures](glass_transition_temperature "wikilink"), *T*<sub>m</sub>,
[thermoplastics](thermoplastic "wikilink") like nylon are [amorphous
solids](amorphous_solid "wikilink") or viscous
[fluids](fluid "wikilink") in which the chains approximate [random
coils](random_coil "wikilink"). Below *T*<sub>m</sub>, amorphous regions
alternate with regions which are
[lamellar](lamellae_(materials) "wikilink")
[crystals](crystal "wikilink").[124] The amorphous regions contribute
elasticity and the crystalline regions contribute strength and rigidity.
The [planar](Plane_(geometry) "wikilink") amide (-CO-NH-) groups are
very [polar](chemical_polarity "wikilink"), so nylon forms multiple
[hydrogen bonds](hydrogen_bond "wikilink") among adjacent strands.
Because the nylon backbone is so regular and symmetrical, especially if
all the amide bonds are in the [*trans*
configuration](geometric_isomerism "wikilink"), nylons often have high
crystallinity and make excellent fibers. The amount of crystallinity
depends on the details of formation, as well as on the kind of nylon.

![](Nylon-3D-h_bond.png "Nylon-3D-h_bond.png")

Nylon 66 can have multiple parallel strands aligned with their
neighboring peptide bonds at coordinated separations of exactly 6 and 4
carbons for considerable lengths, so the [carbonyl](carbonyl "wikilink")
[oxygens](oxygen "wikilink") and amide [hydrogens](hydrogen "wikilink")
can line up to form interchain hydrogen bonds repeatedly, without
interruption (see the figure opposite). Nylon 510 can have coordinated
runs of 5 and 8 carbons. Thus parallel (but not antiparallel) strands
can participate in extended, unbroken, multi-chain [β-pleated
sheets](beta_sheet "wikilink"), a strong and tough supermolecular
structure similar to that found in natural [silk
fibroin](keratin#Molecular_biology_and_biochemistry "wikilink") and the
[β-keratins](keratin "wikilink") in [feathers](feather "wikilink").
(Proteins have only an amino acid α-carbon separating sequential -CO-NH-
groups.) Nylon 6 will form uninterrupted
[H-bonded](hydrogen_bond "wikilink") sheets with mixed directionalities,
but the β-sheet wrinkling is somewhat different. The three-dimensional
disposition of each [alkane](alkane "wikilink") [hydrocarbon
chain](hydrocarbon_chain "wikilink") depends on
[rotations](rotation "wikilink") about the 109.47°
[tetrahedral](alkane#Molecular_geometry "wikilink") bonds of singly
bonded carbon atoms.

When [extruded](extrusion "wikilink") into fibers through pores in an
industry [spinneret](Spinneret_(polymers) "wikilink"), the individual
polymer chains tend to align because of [viscous](viscosity "wikilink")
[flow](rheology "wikilink"). If subjected to [cold
drawing](cold_drawing "wikilink") afterwards, the fibers align further,
increasing their crystallinity, and the material acquires additional
[tensile strength](tensile_strength "wikilink"). In practice, nylon
fibers are most often drawn using heated rolls at high speeds.[125]

Block nylon tends to be less crystalline, except near the surfaces due
to [shearing](Shear_(fluid) "wikilink")
[stresses](stress_(physics) "wikilink") during formation. Nylon is clear
and [colorless](color "wikilink"), or milky, but is easily
[dyed](dye "wikilink"). Multistranded nylon cord and rope is slippery
and tends to unravel. The ends can be [melted](melting "wikilink") and
fused with a heat source such as a [flame](flame "wikilink") or
[electrode](electrode "wikilink") to prevent this.

Nylons are hygroscopic, and will absorb or desorb moisture as a function
of the ambient humidity. Variations in moisture content have several
effects on the polymer. Firstly, the dimensions will change, but more
importantly moisture acts as a plasticizer, lowering the [glass
transition temperature](glass_transition_temperature "wikilink")
(*T*<sub>g</sub>), and consequently the elastic modulus at temperatures
below the *T*<sub>g</sub>[126]

When dry, polyamide is a good electrical insulator. However, polyamide
is [hygroscopic](hygroscopic "wikilink"). The absorption of water will
change some of the material's properties such as its [electrical
resistance](electrical_resistance "wikilink"). Nylon is less absorbent
than wool or cotton.

### Characteristics

The characteristic features of nylon 6,6 include:

-   Pleats and creases can be heat-set at higher temperatures
-   More compact molecular structure
-   Better weathering properties; better sunlight resistance
-   Softer "Hand"
-   High melting point (256 °C/492.8 °F)
-   Superior colorfastness
-   Excellent abrasion resistance

On the other hand, nylon 6 is easy to dye, more readily fades; it has a
higher impact resistance, a more rapid moisture absorption, greater
elasticity and elastic recovery.

-   Variation of luster: nylon has the ability to be very lustrous,
    semi-lustrous or dull.
-   Durability: its high tenacity fibers are used for seatbelts, tire
    cords, ballistic cloth and other uses.
-   High elongation
-   Excellent abrasion resistance
-   Highly resilient (nylon fabrics are heat-set)
-   Paved the way for easy-care garments
-   High resistance to insects, fungi, animals, as well as molds,
    mildew, rot and many chemicals
-   Used in carpets and nylon stockings
-   Melts instead of burning
-   Used in many military applications
-   Good [specific strength](specific_strength "wikilink")
-   Transparent to infrared light (−12 dB)[127]

#### Flammability

Nylon clothing tends to be less flammable than cotton and rayon, but
nylon fibers may melt and stick to skin.[128][129]

## Uses

Nylon was first used commercially in a
nylon-[bristled](bristle "wikilink") [toothbrush](toothbrush "wikilink")
in 1938,[130][131] followed more famously in women's
[stockings](stocking "wikilink") or "nylons" which were shown at the
[1939 New York World's Fair](1939_New_York_World's_Fair "wikilink") and
first sold commercially in 1940.[132] Its use increased dramatically
during World War II, when the need for fabrics increased dramatically.

### Nylon fibers

![](Blue_nylon_ball_gown_2007.154.jpg "fig:Blue_nylon_ball_gown_2007.154.jpg")
\]\]

[Bill Pittendreigh](Bill_Pittendreigh "wikilink"),
[DuPont](DuPont "wikilink"), and other individuals and corporations
worked diligently during the first few months of World War II to find a
way to replace Asian [silk](silk "wikilink") and [hemp](hemp "wikilink")
with nylon in parachutes. It was also used to make
[tires](tire "wikilink"), [tents](tent "wikilink"),
[ropes](rope "wikilink"), [ponchos](poncho "wikilink"), and other
[military](armed_forces "wikilink") supplies. It was even used in the
production of a high-grade paper for U.S.
[currency](currency "wikilink"). At the outset of the war,
[cotton](cotton "wikilink") accounted for more than 80% of all fibers
used and manufactured, and [wool](wool "wikilink") fibers accounted for
nearly all of the rest. By August 1945, manufactured fibers had taken a
market share of 25%, at the expense of cotton. After the war, because of
shortages of both silk and nylon, nylon parachute material was sometimes
repurposed to make dresses.[133]

Nylon 6 and 66 fibers are used in [carpet](Carpet#Nylon "wikilink")
manufacture.

Nylon is one kind of fibers used in [tire
cord](Tire#Materials "wikilink"). [Herman E.
Schroeder](Herman_E._Schroeder "wikilink") pioneered application of
nylon in tires.

### Molds and resins

Nylon resins are widely used in the automobile industry especially in
the engine compartment.[134][135]

Molded nylon is used in hair combs and [mechanical](machine "wikilink")
parts such as [machine screws](machine_screw "wikilink"),
[gears](gear "wikilink"), gaskets, and other low- to medium-stress
components previously cast in metal.[136][137] Engineering-grade nylon
is processed by [extrusion](extrusion "wikilink"),
[casting](casting "wikilink"), and [injection
molding](injection_molding "wikilink"). Type 6,6 Nylon 101 is the most
common commercial grade of nylon, and Nylon 6 is the most common
commercial grade of molded nylon.[138][139] For use in tools such as
[spudgers](spudger "wikilink"), nylon is available in [glass-filled
variants](glass-filled_polymer "wikilink") which increase structural and
impact strength and rigidity, and [molybdenum
disulfide](molybdenum_disulfide "wikilink")-filled variants which
increase [lubricity](lubricity "wikilink"). Nylon can be used as the
matrix material in [composite materials](composite_material "wikilink"),
with reinforcing fibers like glass or carbon fiber; such a composite has
a higher [density](density "wikilink") than pure nylon.[140] Such
thermoplastic composites (25% to 30% glass fiber) are frequently used in
car components next to the engine, such as intake manifolds, where the
good heat resistance of such materials makes them feasible competitors
to metals.[141]

Nylon was used to make the stock of the [Remington Nylon
66](Remington_Nylon_66 "wikilink") rifle.[142] The frame of the modern
[Glock](Glock "wikilink") pistol is made of a nylon composite.[143]

### Food packaging

Nylon resins are used as a component of food packaging films where an
oxygen barrier is needed.[144] Some of the terpolymers based upon nylon
are used every day in packaging. Nylon has been used for
[meat](meat "wikilink") wrappings and [sausage](sausage "wikilink")
sheaths.[145] The high temperature resistance of nylon makes it useful
for oven bags.[146]

### Filaments

Nylon filaments are primarily used in brushes especially
toothbrushes[147] and [string trimmers](string_trimmer "wikilink"). They
are also used as monofilaments in [fishing
line](Fishing_line#Modern_lines "wikilink"). Nylon 610 and 612 are the
most used polymers for filaments.

Its various properties also make it very useful as a material in
[additive manufacturing](additive_manufacturing "wikilink");
specifically as a filament in consumer and professional grade [fused
deposition modeling](fused_deposition_modeling "wikilink") 3D printers.

### Other forms

#### Extruded Profiles

Nylon resins can be extruded into rods, tubes and sheets.[148]

#### Powder Coating

Nylon powders are used to powder coat metals. [Nylon
11](Nylon_11 "wikilink") and nylon 12 are the most widely used.[149]

#### Instrument strings

In the mid-1940s, classical guitarist [Andrés
Segovia](Andrés_Segovia "wikilink") mentioned the shortage of good
guitar strings in the United States, particularly his favorite Pirastro
[catgut](catgut "wikilink") strings, to a number of foreign diplomats at
a party, including General Lindeman of the British Embassy. A month
later, the General presented Segovia with some nylon strings which he
had obtained via some members of the DuPont family. Segovia found that
although the strings produced a clear sound, they had a faint metallic
[timbre](timbre "wikilink") which he hoped could be eliminated.[150]

Nylon strings were first tried on stage by Olga Coelho in New York in
January, 1944.[151]

In 1946, Segovia and string maker [Albert
Augustine](Albert_Augustine_Ltd. "wikilink") were introduced by their
mutual friend Vladimir Bobri, editor of Guitar Review. On the basis of
Segovia's interest and Augustine's past experiments, they decided to
pursue the development of nylon strings. DuPont, skeptical of the idea,
agreed to supply the nylon if Augustine would endeavor to develop and
produce the actual strings. After three years of development, Augustine
demonstrated a nylon first string whose quality impressed guitarists,
including Segovia, in addition to DuPont.[152]

Wound strings, however, were more problematic. Eventually, however,
after experimenting with various types of metal and smoothing and
polishing techniques, Augustine was also able to produce high quality
nylon wound strings.[153]
