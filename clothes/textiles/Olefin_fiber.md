**Olefin fiber** is a [synthetic fiber](synthetic_fiber "wikilink") made
from a [polyolefin](polyolefin "wikilink"), such as
[polypropylene](polypropylene "wikilink") or
[polyethylene](polyethylene "wikilink"). It is used in wallpaper,
carpeting,[1] ropes, and vehicle interiors.

Olefin's advantages are its strength, colourfastness and comfort, its
resistance to staining, mildew, abrasion, sunlight and its good bulk and
cover.[2]

## History

[Italy](Italy "wikilink") began production of olefin fibers in 1957. The
chemist [Giulio Natta](Giulio_Natta "wikilink") successfully formulated
olefin suitable for more textile applications. Both Natta and Karl
Ziegler were later awarded the Nobel Prize for their work on transition
metal catalysis of olefins to fiber, also known as [Ziegler–Natta
catalysis](Ziegler–Natta_catalyst "wikilink").
[U.S.](United_States "wikilink") production of olefin fibers began in
1960. Olefin fibers account for 16% of all manufactured fibers.[3]

## Major fiber properties

Olefin fibers have great bulk and cover while having low specific
gravity. This means “Warmth without the weight.”[4] The fibers have low
moisture absorption, but they can wick moisture and dry quickly.[5]
Olefin is abrasion, stain, sunlight, fire, and chemical resistant. It
does not dye well, but has the advantage of being colorfast. Since
Olefin has a low melting point, textiles can be thermally bonded. The
fibers have the lowest static of all manufactured fibers and a medium
luster. One of the most important properties of olefin is its strength.
It keeps its strength in wet or dry conditions and is very resilient.
The fiber can be produced for strength of different properties.

## Production method

The [Federal Trade Commission](Federal_Trade_Commission "wikilink")'s
official definition of olefin fiber is “A manufactured fiber in which
the fiber forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer composed
of at least 85% by weight of [ethylene](ethylene "wikilink"),
[propylene](propylene "wikilink"), or other olefin units”[6]

Polymerization of propylene and ethylene gases, controlled with special
catalysts, creates olefin fibers. Dye is added directly to the polymer
before [melt spinning](melt_spinning "wikilink") is applied. Additives,
polymer variations and different process conditions can create a range
of characteristics.[7]

High pressure production, which uses ten tons per square inch, creates a
film for molded materials. Low pressure production uses a low
temperature with a catalyst and hydrocarbon solvent. This process is
less expensive and produces a polyethylene polymer more for textile
use.[8]

The polymer is then melted, spun, by a
[spinneret](Spinneret_(polymers) "wikilink") into water, or air cooled.
The fiber is drawn out to six times the spun length. [Gel
spinning](Gel_spinning "wikilink") is a new method in which a gel form
of polyethylene polymers is used.[9]

## Physical and chemical structure

### Physical

Olefin fibers can be multi- or monofilament and staple, tow, or film
yarns. The fibers are colorless and round in cross section. This cross
section can be modified for different end uses. The physical
characteristics are a waxy feel and colorless.[10]

### Chemical

There are two types of polymers that can be used in olefin fibers. The
first, polyethylene, is a simple linear structure with repeating units.
These fibers are used mainly for ropes, twines and utility fabrics.[11]

The second type, polypropylene, is a three-dimensional structure with a
backbone of carbon atoms. Methyl groups protrude from this backbone.
Stereoselective polymerization orders these methyl groups to the same
spatial placement. This creates a crystalline polypropylene polymer. The
fibers made with these polymers can be used in apparel, furnishing and
industrial products.[12]

## Manufacturers

The first commercial producer of an olefin fiber in the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") was [Hercules](Hercules "wikilink"),
Inc. (FiberVisions). Other U.S. olefin fiber producers include Asota;
American Fibers and Yarns Co; American Synthetic Fiber, LLC; Color-Fi;
FiberVisions; Foss Manufacturing Co., LLC; Drake Extrusion; Filament
Fiber Technology, Inc.; TenCate Geosynthetics; Universal Fiber Systems
LLC.[13]

## Uses

### Apparel

Sports & active wear, socks, hoodies, thermal underwear; lining fabrics.

### Home furnishing

Olefin can be used by itself or in blends for indoor and outdoor
carpets, carpet tiles, and carpet backing. The fiber can also be used in
upholstery, draperies, wall coverings, slipcovers, and floor coverings.

### Automotive

Olefin can be used for interior fabrics, sun visors, arm rests, door and
side panels, trunks, parcel shelves, and resin replacement as binder
fibers.

### Industrial

In an industrial setting, olefin creates carpets; ropes, geo-textiles
that are in contact with the soil, filter fabrics, bagging, concrete
reinforcement, and heat-sealable paper (e.g. tea- and coffee-bags).

## Care procedures

Avoid [dry cleaning](dry_cleaning "wikilink") Olefin as many
dry-cleaning solvents can swell the fibers. Since Olefin dries quickly,
line drying and low tumble drying with little or no heat is the
recommended method of drying. Since Olefin is not absorbent, waterborne
stains do not present a problem. However, oily stains are difficult to
remove. Most such stains can be removed with lukewarm water and
detergent, but bleach can also be used. Olefin fiber has a low melting
point (around 225 to 335 °F, depending on the polymer's grade) so items
should be ironed at a very low temperature, if at all. Items such as
outdoor carpets and other fabrics can be hosed off. Olefin is easy to
recycle.
