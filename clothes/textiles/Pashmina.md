**Pashmina** is a fine type of [cashmere
wool](cashmere_wool "wikilink"). The [textiles](textiles "wikilink")
made from it were first woven in [Kashmir](Kashmir "wikilink").[1][2]
The name comes from / *pašmina*, meaning "made from wool".[3] Pashmina
came to be known as 'cashmere' in the West because Europeans first
encountered this fibre in Kashmir.[4] The [wool](wool "wikilink") comes
from a number of different breeds of the [cashmere
goat](cashmere_goat "wikilink"); such as the
[changthangi](changthangi "wikilink") or pashmina goat from the
[Changthang](Changtang "wikilink") Plateau in
[Ladakh](Ladakh "wikilink") region, the malra from the
[Kargil](Kargil "wikilink") area in the Ladakh region, the chegu from
[Himachal Pradesh](Himachal_Pradesh "wikilink") in the
[Himalayas](Himalayas "wikilink") of northern India, and the chyangara
or Nepalese pashmina goat from [Nepal](Nepal "wikilink"). Often shawls
called *[shahmina](shahmina "wikilink")* are made from this material in
Kashmir and Nepal; these shawls are [hand
spun](spinning_(textiles) "wikilink") and [woven](weaving "wikilink")
from the very fine [cashmere](Cashmere_wool "wikilink") fibre.[5][6]

## History

![](Mandala_Chandar,_Kashmir_1840.jpg "fig:Mandala_Chandar,_Kashmir_1840.jpg")
moon shawl (chandar) with a [mandala](mandala "wikilink") to the centre
from which radiate [zoomorphic](zoomorphic "wikilink") tendrils, filled
with multi-coloured [millefleurs](millefleur "wikilink") on a pink
ground.\]\] Woven shawls in India have been worn as early as the [Indus
Valley Civilisation](Indus_Valley_Civilisation "wikilink"). A famous
example is the statue of a priest-king found at
[Mohenjo-Daro](Mohenjo-Daro "wikilink"), who is draped in a shawl
decorated with trefoil patterns.

Woolen shawls made in [Kashmir](Kashmir "wikilink") are mentioned in
Afghan texts between the 3rd century BC and the 11th century AD.[7]
However, the founder of the pashmina industry is traditionally held to
be the 15th century ruler of Kashmir,
[Zayn-ul-Abidin](Zain-ul-Abidin "wikilink"), who introduced weavers from
[Central Asia](Central_Asia "wikilink"). Other sources consider pashmina
crafts were introduced by [Mir Sayyid Ali
Hamadani](Mir_Sayyid_Ali_Hamadani "wikilink")[8] who, as tradition has
it, arrived to Kashmir from Persia along with 700 craftsmen.[9]

Pashmina shawls have been worn by the royalty and the elites in the
region for centuries. Pashmina blankets were also vital additions to a
wealthy women's dowry in India, Pakistan and Nepal. They are a sort of
status symbol in these countries.[10] Pashmina crafts were made popular
in Kashmir by [Mir Sayyid Ali
Hamadani](Mir_Sayyid_Ali_Hamadani "wikilink").[11][12]

Pashmina is derived from mountain breeds of goat (*[Capra
hircus](Capra_hircus "wikilink")*). One distinct difference between
pashmina and generic cashmere is the fibre diameter. Pashmina fibres are
finer and thinner (12–15 microns) than generic cashmere fibre (15–19
microns)[13] and therefore ideal for making lightweight apparel like
fine scarves. As the fibre diameter is very low, pashmina has to be
hand-processed and woven into products such as shawls, scarves, wraps,
throws, stoles, etc. However, the quality of a finished shawl is not
solely dependent on the fibre diameter of the wool but also on the
craftsmen's skills. Pashmina products are often made in
[Kashmir](Kashmir "wikilink") and [Nepal](Nepal "wikilink").

Today, however, the word "pashmina" is used indiscriminately, and many
scarves made from natural or synthetic fiber are sold under the name
"pashmina", creating confusion in the market. The exorbitant price of a
real pashmina shawl is due to the amount of expert craftsmanship that
goes into creating each shawl and the rarity of the pashmina wool – the
wool is used in a Kashmiri pashmina shawl is often sourced from the
[changthangi](changthangi "wikilink") breed of goat and this breed
constitutes less than 0.1% of global cashmere production.[14]

## Production

Goats used for pashmina shed their winter coat every spring. One goat
sheds approximately 80–170 gram (3–6 ounces) of the
[fibre](fibre "wikilink"). See also [cashmere
wool](cashmere_wool "wikilink").

In the spring (the moulting season), the goats naturally shed their
[undercoat](Down_hair "wikilink"), which regrows in winter. This
undercoat is collected by combing the goat, not by shearing, as in other
fine wools. A traditional producer of pashmina wool in the
[Ladakh](Ladakh "wikilink") region of the
[Himalayas](Himalayas "wikilink") are a people known as the
[Changpa](Changpa "wikilink"). These are a nomadic people and inhabit
the Changthang plateau of [Tibet](Tibet "wikilink"), which has a lowest
altitude of 13,500 feet above sea level and a winter temperature which
can drop to −40 degree Celsius. The Changpa rear sheep in these harsh
climates for meat, and pashmina goats for wool.[15]

Raw pashmina is exported to Kashmir. All steps from combing (removing
impurities and guard hair, and aligning fibres) and spinning, to weaving
and finishing, are traditionally carried out by hand by specialized
craftsmen and women. The major centre of pashmina fabric production is
in the old district of the city of [Srinagar](Srinagar "wikilink"). The
approximate time put into producing a single traditional pashmina stole
(70x200cm) is 180 hours.

China accounts for 70% of the world cashmere production, Mongolia 20%,
the remaining 10% of production is in Afghanistan, Australia, India,
Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, United States, the Central Asian republics and
elsewhere. Only a small percentage of this production is the ultra-fine
cashmere known as pashmina.[16]

## Pashmina products

Pashmina accessories are known for their softness and warmth. They are
available in a range of sizes, from "scarf" to
"[wrap](wrap_(clothing) "wikilink")" or
"[stole](Stole_(shawl) "wikilink")" to full sized shawl and in rare
cases, "macho" . Pure pashmina is a rather gauzy, open weave, as the
fibre cannot tolerate high tension. The most popular pashmina fabric is
a 70% pashmina/30% [silk](silk "wikilink") blend, but 50/50 is also
common. The 70/30 is tightly woven, has an elegant sheen and drapes
nicely, but is still quite soft and light-weight.

A craze for pashmina shawls, known as *[shahmina](shahmina "wikilink")*
in Kashmir, in the mid-1990s resulted in high demand for the raw
material, so demand exceeded supply. When these shawls rose into fashion
prominence during the era, they were marketed dubiously. In the consumer
markets, pashmina shawls have been redefined as a shawl/wrap with
[cashmere](Cashmere_wool "wikilink") and cashmere/silk, notwithstanding
the actual meaning of pashmina. Some shawls marketed as pashmina shawls
contain (sheep) wool,[17] while other unscrupulous companies marketed
artificial fabrics such as [viscose](viscose "wikilink") and others as
"pashmina" with deceptive marketing statements such as "authentic
viscose pashmina".

The word "pashmina" is not a labelling term recognized by law in the
United States, where it is considered another term for cashmere.
According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission:

> Some manufacturers use the term pashmina to describe an ultra fine
> cashmere fiber ; others use the term to describe a blend of cashmere
> and silk. The FTC encourages manufacturers and sellers of products
> described as pashmina to explain to consumers, on a hangtag, for
> example, what they mean by the term.
>
> As with all other wool products, the fiber content of a shawl, scarf
> or other item marketed as pashmina must be accurately disclosed. For
> example, a blend of cashmere and silk might be labeled 50% Cashmere,
> 50% Silk or 70% Cashmere, 30% Silk, depending upon the actual cashmere
> and silk content. If the item contains only cashmere, it should be
> labeled 100% Pashmina or All Cashmere, by the Wool Act or
> regulations.[18]
