![](Barong_Up_Close.jpg "fig:Barong_Up_Close.jpg") made with piña
fiber.\]\] **Piña** is a fiber made from the leaves of a
[pineapple](pineapple "wikilink") plant and is commonly used in the
[Philippines](Philippines "wikilink") (also known as nanas or nenas in
Tagalog). It is sometimes combined with [silk](silk "wikilink") or
[polyester](polyester "wikilink") to create a
[textile](textile "wikilink") fabric. Piña's name comes from the
[Spanish](Spanish_language "wikilink") word *piña* which means
pineapple, although it has been in usage prior to the Spanish era in the
[Philippines](Philippines "wikilink").

In February 2018, the [National Commission for Culture and the
Arts](National_Commission_for_Culture_and_the_Arts "wikilink"), along
with the government of [Aklan](Aklan "wikilink"), began the process of
nominating Kalibo piña weaving in the [UNESCO Intangible Cultural
Heritage
Lists](UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists "wikilink").[1]

## Production methods

![](Pineapple-fiber-extraction.jpg "Pineapple-fiber-extraction.jpg")

Since piña is from a leaf, the leaf has to be cut first from the plant.
Then the fiber is pulled or split away from the leaf. Most leaf fibers
are long and somewhat stiff. Each strand of the piña fiber is hand
scraped and is knotted one by one to form a continuous filament to be
handwoven and then made into a piña cloth.

## Producers

[Kalibo](Kalibo "wikilink"), [Aklan](Aklan "wikilink"), is the main and
the oldest manufacturer/weaver of piña cloth in the Philippines which
are being exported to various parts of the world most particularly North
America, and Europe.[2] Piña weaving is an age-old tradition which was
recently revived in the past 20 years.

Pineapple silk was considered the queen of Philippine fabrics and is
considered the fabric of choice of the Philippine elite. During the 1996
[APEC](APEC "wikilink") summit held in the Philippines, world leaders
donned [Barong Tagalog](Barong_Tagalog "wikilink") made of piña sourced
from [Kalibo](Kalibo "wikilink") during the group photo.

Producers include La Herminia Piña Weaving Industry,[3] Malabon Pina
Producers and Weavers Association, Reycon's Piña Cloth and Industry, and
Rurungan sa Tubod Foundation.[4]

## Uses

A major use for piña fabric is in the creation of the [Barong
Tagalog](Barong_Tagalog "wikilink") and other formal wear in the
[Philippines](Philippines "wikilink"). It is also used for other table
linens, bags, mats and other clothing items, or anytime that a
lightweight, but stiff and sheer fabric is needed.
