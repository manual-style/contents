**Polyester** is a category of [polymers](polymer "wikilink") that
contain the [ester](ester "wikilink") [functional
group](functional_group "wikilink") in their main chain. As a specific
[material](material "wikilink"), it most commonly refers to a type
called [polyethylene
terephthalate](polyethylene_terephthalate "wikilink") (PET). Polyesters
include naturally occurring chemicals, such as in the
[cutin](cutin "wikilink") of [plant cuticles](plant_cuticle "wikilink"),
as well as synthetics such as [polybutyrate](polybutyrate "wikilink").
Natural polyesters and a few synthetic ones are
[biodegradable](biodegradable "wikilink"), but most synthetic polyesters
are not. The material is used extensively in clothing.

Polyester fibers are sometimes spun together with natural fibers to
produce a cloth with blended properties.
[Cotton](Cotton "wikilink")-polyester blends can be strong, wrinkle- and
tear-resistant, and reduce shrinking. [Synthetic
fibers](Synthetic_fiber "wikilink") using polyester have high water,
wind and environmental resistance compared to plant-derived fibers. They
are less [fire-resistant](Fireproofing "wikilink") and can melt when
ignited.[1]

Polyester blends have been renamed so as to suggest their similarity or
even superiority to natural fibers (for example, some varieties of China
silk, which is an essentially deceptive term in the textiles industry
for a synthetic fiber woven to resemble the sheen and durability of
insect-derived [silk](silk "wikilink"), are 100% polyester or a
polyester-rayon blend.)

Liquid crystalline polyesters are among the first industrially used
[liquid crystal polymers](liquid_crystal_polymer "wikilink"). They are
used for their mechanical properties and heat-resistance. These traits
are also important in their application as an abradable seal in jet
engines.[2]

Natural polyesters could have played a significant role in the [origins
of life](origins_of_life "wikilink"). Long heterogeneous polyester
chains and membraneless structures are known to easily form in a one-pot
reaction without catalyst under simple prebiotic conditions.[3][4]

## Types

Depending on the chemical structure, polyester can be a
[thermoplastic](thermoplastic "wikilink") or
[thermoset](thermoset "wikilink"). There are also [polyester
resins](polyester_resin "wikilink") cured by hardeners; however, the
most common polyesters are thermoplastics.[5] Examples of thermoset
polyesters include some of the Desmophen brand from Bayer. The OH group
is reacted with an [Isocyanate](Isocyanate "wikilink") functional
compound in a 2 component system producing coatings which may optionally
be pigmented. Polyesters as thermoplastics may change shape after the
application of heat. While combustible at high temperatures, polyesters
tend to shrink away from flames and self-extinguish upon ignition.
Polyester fibers have high
[tenacity](Tenacity_(textile_strength) "wikilink") and
[E-modulus](young's_modulus "wikilink") as well as low water absorption
and minimal [shrinkage](Shrinkage_(fabric) "wikilink") in comparison
with other industrial fibers.

[Unsaturated polyesters](Polyester_resin "wikilink") (UPR) are
thermosetting [resins](resin "wikilink"). They are used in the liquid
state as [casting](casting "wikilink") materials, in [sheet molding
compounds](sheet_molding_compound "wikilink"), as
[fiberglass](fiberglass "wikilink") laminating resins and in
non-metallic auto-body fillers. They are also used as the [thermoset
polymer matrix](thermoset_polymer_matrix "wikilink") in
[pre-pregs](pre-preg "wikilink"). Fiberglass-reinforced unsaturated
polyesters find wide application in bodies of yachts and as body parts
of cars.

Increasing the aromatic parts of polyesters increases their [glass
transition temperature](glass_transition_temperature "wikilink"),
melting temperature, [thermal stability](thermostability "wikilink"),
chemical stability...

Polyesters can also be [telechelic](telechelic "wikilink")
[oligomers](oligomer "wikilink") like the polycaprolactone diol (PCL)
and the polyethylene adipate diol (PEA). They are then used as
[prepolymers](prepolymer "wikilink").

## Uses and applications

[Fabrics](Fabrics "wikilink") woven or knitted from polyester thread or
yarn are used extensively in apparel and home furnishings, from shirts
and pants to jackets and hats, bed sheets, blankets, upholstered
furniture and computer mouse mats. Industrial polyester fibers, yarns
and ropes are used in car tire reinforcements, fabrics for conveyor
belts, safety belts, coated fabrics and plastic reinforcements with
high-energy absorption. Polyester fiber is used as cushioning and
insulating material in pillows, comforters and upholstery padding.
Polyester fabrics are highly stain-resistantâ€”in fact, the only class of
dyes which *can* be used to alter the color of polyester fabric are what
are known as [disperse dyes](disperse_dye "wikilink").[6]

Polyesters are also used to make bottles, films,
[tarpaulin](tarpaulin "wikilink"), canoes, [liquid crystal
displays](liquid_crystal_display "wikilink"),
[holograms](hologram "wikilink"),
[filters](filter_(chemistry) "wikilink"),
[dielectric](dielectric "wikilink") film for
[capacitors](capacitor "wikilink"), [film
insulation](Electrical_insulation "wikilink") for
[wire](wire "wikilink") and [insulating
tapes](insulating_tape "wikilink"). Polyesters are widely used as a
finish on high-quality wood products such as
[guitars](guitar "wikilink"), [pianos](piano "wikilink") and
vehicle/yacht interiors. [Thixotropic](Thixotropic "wikilink")
properties of spray-applicable polyesters make them ideal for use on
open-grain timbers, as they can quickly fill wood grain, with a
high-build film thickness per coat. Cured polyesters can be sanded and
polished to a high-gloss, durable finish.

## Industry

### Basics

Polyester is a synthetic polymer made of [purified terephthalic
acid](purified_terephthalic_acid "wikilink") (PTA) or its dimethyl ester
[dimethyl terephthalate](dimethyl_terephthalate "wikilink") (DMT) and
[monoethylene glycol](monoethylene_glycol "wikilink") (MEG). With 18%
market share of all plastic materials produced, it ranges third after
[polyethylene](polyethylene "wikilink") (33.5%) and
[polypropylene](polypropylene "wikilink") (19.5%).

The main raw materials are described as follows:

Purified terephthalic acid (PTA) CAS-No. 100-21-0: Synonym: 1,4 benzenedicarboxylic acid,
Sum formula: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(COOH)<sub>2</sub>, mol. weight: 166.13
Dimethylterephthalate (DMT) CAS-No. 120-61-6: Synonym: 1,4 benzenedicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester,
Sum formula: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(COOCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, mol. weight: 194.19
Mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) CAS No. 107-21-1: Synonym: 1,2 ethanediol,
Sum formula: C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> , mol. weight: 62.07

To make a polymer of high [molecular
weight](molecular_weight "wikilink") a catalyst is needed. The most
common catalyst is [antimony trioxide](antimony_trioxide "wikilink") (or
antimony tri-acetate):

Antimony trioxide (ATO) CAS-No. 1309-64-4: mol. weight: 291.51,
Sum formula: Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>

In 2008, about 10,000 tonnes Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were used to
produce around 49 million tonnes polyethylene terephthalate.

Polyester is described as follows:

Polyethylene terephthalate CAS-No. 25038-59-9: Synonyms/abbreviations: polyester, PET, PES,
Sum formula: H-\[C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>4</sub>\]-n=60â€“120 OH, mol. unit weight: 192.17

There are several reasons for the importance of polyester:

-   The relatively easy accessible raw materials PTA or DMT and MEG
-   The very well understood and described simple chemical process of
    polyester synthesis
-   The low toxicity level of all raw materials and side products during
    polyester production and processing
-   The possibility to produce PET in a closed loop at low emissions to
    the environment
-   The outstanding mechanical and chemical properties of polyester
-   The recyclability
-   The wide variety of intermediate and final products made of
    polyester.

In the following table, the estimated world polyester production is
shown. Main applications are [textile](textile "wikilink") polyester,
bottle polyester resin, film polyester mainly for
[packaging](packaging "wikilink") and specialty polyesters for
engineering plastics. According to this table, the world's total
polyester production might exceed 50 million tons per annum before the
year 2010.

| Product type        | 2002 (million tonnes/year) | 2008 (million tonnes/year) |

World polyester production by year

### Raw material producer

The raw materials PTA, DMT, and MEG are mainly produced by large
chemical companies which are sometimes integrated down to the crude oil
refinery where [*p*-Xylene](P-Xylene "wikilink") is the base material to
produce PTA and [liquefied petroleum
gas](liquefied_petroleum_gas "wikilink") (LPG) is the base material to
produce MEG.

### Polyester processing

After the first stage of polymer production in the melt phase, the
product stream divides into two different application areas which are
mainly textile applications and packaging applications. In the following
table, the main applications of textile and packaging of polyester are
listed.

| Textile                                            | Packaging                                             |

A comparable small market segment (much less than 1 million tonnes/year)
of polyester is used to produce engineering plastics and
[masterbatch](masterbatch "wikilink").

In order to produce the polyester melt with a high efficiency,
high-output processing steps like staple fiber (50â€“300 tonnes/day per
spinning line) or POY /FDY (up to 600 tonnes/day split into about 10
spinning machines) are meanwhile more and more vertically integrated
direct processes. This means the polymer melt is directly converted into
the textile fibers or filaments without the common step of
[pelletizing](pelletizing "wikilink"). We are talking about full
[vertical integration](horizontal_integration "wikilink") when polyester
is produced at one site starting from crude oil or
[distillation](distillation "wikilink") products in the chain oil â†’
benzene â†’ PX â†’ PTA â†’ PET melt â†’ fiber/filament or bottle-grade resin.
Such integrated processes are meanwhile established in more or less
interrupted processes at one production site. Eastman Chemicals were the
first to introduce the idea of closing the chain from PX to PET resin
with their so-called INTEGREX process. The capacity of such vertically
integrated production sites is \>1000 tonnes/day and can easily reach
2500 tonnes/day.

Besides the above-mentioned large processing units to produce staple
fiber or yarns, there are ten thousands of small and very small
processing plants, so that one can estimate that polyester is processed
and recycled in more than 10 000 plants around the globe. This is
without counting all the companies involved in the supply industry,
beginning with engineering and processing machines and ending with
special additives, stabilizers and colors. This is a gigantic industry
complex and it is still growing by 4â€“8% per year, depending on the world
region.

## Synthesis

Synthesis of polyesters is generally achieved by a polycondensation
reaction. See "[condensation
reactions](condensation_reaction "wikilink") in polymer chemistry". The
general equation for the reaction of a diol with a diacid is :


(n+1) R(OH)<sub>2</sub> + n RÂ´(COOH)<sub>2</sub> â†’
HO\[ROOCRÂ´COO\]<sub>n</sub>ROH + 2n H<sub>2</sub>O

### Azeotrope esterification

In this classical method, an [alcohol](alcohol "wikilink") and a
[carboxylic acid](carboxylic_acid "wikilink") react to form a carboxylic
ester. To assemble a polymer, the water formed by the reaction must be
continually removed by [azeotrope](azeotrope "wikilink") distillation.

### Alcoholic transesterification

![](Transesterification.png "fig:Transesterification.png")
([methanol](methanol "wikilink") is the byproduct of the esterification
reaction). \]\]

### Acylation (HCl method)

The acid begins as an acid chloride, and thus the polycondensation
proceeds with emission of [hydrochloric
acid](hydrochloric_acid "wikilink") (HCl) instead of water. This method
can be carried out in solution or as an
[enamel](vitreous_enamel "wikilink").


**Silyl method**

In this variant of the HCl method, the carboxylic acid chloride is
converted with the trimethyl silyl ether of the alcohol component and
production of trimethyl silyl chloride is obtained

### Acetate method (esterification)


**Silyl acetate method**

### Ring-opening polymerization

[Aliphatic](Aliphatic "wikilink") polyesters can be assembled from
[lactones](lactone "wikilink") under very mild conditions, catalyzed
[anionically](anionic "wikilink"), [cationically](cationic "wikilink")
or [metallorganically](metallorganic "wikilink"). A number of catalytic
methods for the copolymerization of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides have
also recently been shown to provide a wide array of functionalized
polyesters, both saturated and unsaturated.

## History

In 1926, United States-based [E.I. du Pont de Nemours and
Co.](DuPont "wikilink") began research on large molecules and synthetic
fibers. This early research, headed by W.H. Carothers, centered on what
became [nylon](nylon "wikilink"), which was the first synthetic
fiber.[7] Carothers was working for duPont at the time. Carotherâ€™s
research was incomplete and had not advanced to investigating the
polyester formed from mixing ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid. The
project was revived by British scientists
[Whinfield](John_Rex_Whinfield "wikilink") and Dickson, who patented
[polyethylene terephthalate](polyethylene_terephthalate "wikilink")
(PET) or PETE in 1941. Polyethylene terephthalate forms the basis for
synthetic fibers like [Dacron](Dacron "wikilink"), Terylene and
polyester. In 1946, duPont bought all legal rights from Imperial
Chemical Industries (ICI).[8]

## Biodegradation

The [futuro](futuro "wikilink") house was made of fibreglass-reinforced
polyester plastic; polyester-polyurethane, and poly(methylmethacrylate)
one of them was found to be degrading by
[Cyanobacteria](Cyanobacteria "wikilink") and
[Archaea](Archaea "wikilink").[9][10]

### Cross-linking

Unsaturated polyesters are thermosetting resins. They are generally
copolymers prepared by polymerizing one or more [diol](diol "wikilink")
with saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids ([maleic
acid](maleic_acid "wikilink"), [fumaric
acid](fumaric_acid "wikilink")...) or their
[anhydrides](anhydride "wikilink"). The double bond of unsaturated
polyesters reacts with a [vinyl](vinyl_group "wikilink") monomer,
usually [styrene](styrene "wikilink"), resulting in a 3-D cross-linked
structure. This structure acts as a thermoset. The
[exothermic](exothermic "wikilink")
[cross-linking](cross-link "wikilink") reaction is initiated through a
[catalyst](catalyst "wikilink"), usually an [organic
peroxide](organic_peroxide "wikilink") such as [methyl ethyl ketone
peroxide](methyl_ethyl_ketone_peroxide "wikilink") or [benzoyl
peroxide](benzoyl_peroxide "wikilink").

## Environmental concerns

### Pollution of freshwater and seawater habitats

A team at Plymouth University in the UK spent 12 months analysing what
happened when a number of synthetic materials were washed at different
temperatures in domestic washing machines, using different combinations
of detergents, to quantify the microfibres shed. They found that an
average washing load of 6Â kg could release an estimated 137,951 fibres
from polyester-cotton blend fabric, 496,030 fibres from polyester and
728,789 from acrylic. Those fibers add to the general
[microplastics](microplastics "wikilink")
[pollution](plastic_pollution "wikilink").[11][12][13]

### Non-renewable

Polyester is a synthetic petroleum-based fibre, and is therefore a
non-renewable carbon-intensive resource.[14] Nearly 70 million barrels
of oil are used each year to make polyester around the world, which is
now the most commonly used fiber in making clothes. But it takes more
than 200 years to decompose.[15]
