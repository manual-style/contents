**Pongee** is a soft thin woven [cloth](/cloth "wikilink"). In the early
20th century, pongee was an important export from China to the United
States. Pongee is still woven in silk by many mills across China,
especially along the banks of the Yangtze at mills in Sichuan, Anhui,
Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces. Generally it varies in weight from 36 to
about 50gm/sq m. In lighter variants, it is called Paj. It is used as a
blouse weight or lining silk.
