**Ramie** (, ) is a [flowering plant](flowering_plant "wikilink") in the
nettle family [Urticaceae](Urticaceae "wikilink"), native to eastern
[Asia](Asia "wikilink"). It is a
[herbaceous](Herbaceous_plant "wikilink")
[perennial](perennial_plant "wikilink") growing to tall;[1] the
[leaves](leaf "wikilink") are heart-shaped, long and broad, and white on
the underside with dense, small hairs—this gives it a silvery
appearance; unlike [stinging nettles](Urtica_dioica "wikilink"), the
hairs do not sting. The true ramie or **China grass** is also called
**Chinese plant** or **white ramie**.

A second type, known as **green ramie** or **rhea**, is believed to have
originated in the [Malay Peninsula](Malay_Peninsula "wikilink"). It has
smaller leaves which are green on the underside, and it appears to be
better suited to [tropical](tropical "wikilink") conditions.[2] The word
"ramie" is derived from the [Malay](Malay_language "wikilink") word
*rami*.[3]

## Cultivation

![](Ramieoutput.png "fig:Ramieoutput.png") Ramie is one of the oldest
[fiber crops](fiber_crop "wikilink"), having been used for at least
6,000 years, and is principally used for fabric production. It is a
[bast fiber](bast_fiber "wikilink"), and the fiber used for textiles
comes from the inner bark ([phloem](phloem "wikilink")) of the
vegetative stalks and not the woody stem or outer bark. Ramie is
normally harvested two to three times a year, but under good growing
conditions can be harvested up to six times per year.[4] Unlike other
bast crops, ramie requires chemical processing to de-gum the fiber.

When the plant begins flowering, or just before, it signals both a
decline in growth and the plant being at its maximum fibre content, and
is harvested.[5] Stems are harvested by cutting just above the lateral
roots or by bending the stem. This enables the core to be broken and the
[cortex](Cortex_(botany) "wikilink") can be stripped from the plant *in
situ*.[6]

After harvesting, stems are [decorticated](decorticator "wikilink")
while the plants are fresh. If this is not done while the plants are
still fresh, the plants dry out and the bark will be difficult to
remove. The bark ribbon is then dried as quickly as possible, preventing
[bacteria](bacteria "wikilink") and [fungi](fungi "wikilink") from
attacking it.[7]

The dry weight of harvested stem from crops ranges from 3.4 to 4.5
t/ha/year. A 4.5-ton crop yields 1,600 kg/ha/year of dry undegummed
fiber. The weight loss during degumming can be up to 25%, giving a yield
of degummed fiber of about 1,200 kg/ha/year.[8]

The fiber extraction occurs in three stages. First, the cortex (bark) is
removed; this can be done manually or by machine. This process is called
decortication. Second, the cortex is scraped to remove most of the outer
bark, the [parenchyma](parenchyma "wikilink") in the bast layer and some
of the gums and pectins. Third, the residual cortex material is washed,
dried, and degummed to extract the spinnable
[fiber](fiber "wikilink").[9]

## History

![](Preparing_of_Ramie_35_Fiber_for_weaving_PP01.11.021D.035.jpg "fig:Preparing_of_Ramie_35_Fiber_for_weaving_PP01.11.021D.035.jpg")
Ramie has been grown in [China](Ancient_China "wikilink") for many
centuries, and farmers in ancient China are known to have used the fiber
to weave clothing. It may have been used in cloth for wrapping mummies
in [Egypt](Egypt "wikilink"). Though ramie and flax are difficult to
distinguish in ancient cloth, ramie's resistance to bacteria and mildew
would make it appropriate for mummy wrapping.[10]

Ramie was used to produce an open-weave fabric called
[mechera](mechera "wikilink"), used for shirts and dressing gowns
suitable for warm climates. The French painter [Raoul
Dufy](Raoul_Dufy "wikilink") designed in the early 20th century patterns
for prints on mechera used by the French shirtmaker
[Charvet](Charvet_Place_Vendôme "wikilink").[11]

[Brazil](Agriculture_in_Brazil "wikilink") began production in the late
1930s with production peaking in 1971. Since then, production has
steadily declined as a result of competition from alternative crops,
such as [soybeans](soybean "wikilink") and synthetic fibers.[12]

## Properties

Ramie is one of the strongest natural fibers. It exhibits even greater
strength when wet. Ramie fiber is known especially for its ability to
hold shape, reduce wrinkling, and introduce a [silky](silk "wikilink")
lustre to the fabric appearance. It is not as durable as other fibers,
so is usually used as a blend with other fibers such as
[cotton](cotton "wikilink") or [wool](wool "wikilink"). It is similar to
[linen](linen "wikilink") in absorbency, density, and microscopic
appearance. It does not dye as well as cotton. Because of its high
molecular crystallinity, ramie is stiff and brittle and will break if
folded repeatedly in the same place; it lacks resiliency and is low in
elasticity and elongation potential.[13]

## Uses

![](Banh_gai_3.jpg "fig:Banh_gai_3.jpg")
![](MET_DP158227.jpg "fig:MET_DP158227.jpg") Despite its strength, ramie
has had limited acceptance for [textile](textile "wikilink") use. The
fiber's extraction and cleaning are expensive, chiefly because of the
several steps—involving scraping, pounding, heating, washing, or
exposure to chemicals. Some or all are needed to separate the raw fiber
from the adhesive gums or resins. Spinning the fiber is difficult due to
its brittle quality and low elasticity; and weaving is complicated by
the hairy surface of the yarn, resulting from lack of cohesion between
the fibers. Greater utilization of ramie may depend upon development of
improved processing methods and the need to find [plastic
alternatives](plastic_pollution "wikilink").[16]

Ramie is used to make such products as industrial sewing thread, packing
materials, fishing nets, and filter cloths. It is also made into fabrics
for household furnishings ([upholstery](upholstery "wikilink"),
[canvas](canvas "wikilink")) and clothing, frequently in blends with
other textile fibers (for instance when used in a mixture with
[wool](wool "wikilink"), shrinkage is reported to be greatly reduced
when compared with pure wool). Shorter fibers and waste are used in
paper manufacture. Ramie ribbon is used in fine
[bookbinding](bookbinding "wikilink") as a substitute for traditional
linen tape.

For the 2010 [Prius](Toyota_Prius "wikilink"),
[Toyota](Toyota "wikilink") began using a new range of plant-derived
ecological [bioplastics](bioplastic "wikilink") made from the
[cellulose](cellulose "wikilink") in wood or grass instead of
[petroleum](petroleum "wikilink"). One of the two principal crops used
is ramie.

Ramie is also used as an [ornamental plant](ornamental_plant "wikilink")
in [eastern Asia](eastern_Asia "wikilink").

In [Vietnam](Vietnam "wikilink"), ramie leaves are called "cây lá gai,"
which is a main ingredient in making "bánh gai" or "bánh ít lá gai," a
Vietnamese glutinous rice cake. The leaves give the cake its distinct
color, flavor and fragrance.

Ramie is also occasionally used in the construction of high performance
rowing oar shafts. Mahe Drysdale used sculling oars made with ramie
during the 2018 Rio Olympics where he won Gold in the Men's 1X Scull.

## Producers

[China](Agriculture_in_China "wikilink") leads in the production of
ramie and exports mainly to [Japan](Japan "wikilink") and
[Europe](Europe "wikilink"). Other producers include
[Japan](Agriculture_in_Japan "wikilink"),
[Taiwan](Agriculture_in_Taiwan "wikilink"), the
[Philippines](Agriculture_in_the_Philippines "wikilink"), and
[Brazil](Brazil "wikilink").[17] Only a small percentage of the ramie
produced is available on the international market. Japan,
[Germany](Germany "wikilink"), [France](France "wikilink") and the
[UK](UK "wikilink") are the main importers, the remaining supply is used
domestically.[18]
