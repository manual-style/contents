**Rayon** is a manufactured [fiber](fiber "wikilink") made from natural
sources such as wood and agricultural products that are regenerated as
[cellulose fiber](cellulose_fiber "wikilink"). The many types and grades
of rayon can imitate the feel and texture of [natural
fibers](natural_fiber "wikilink") such as [silk](silk "wikilink"),
[wool](wool "wikilink"), [cotton](cotton "wikilink"), and
[linen](linen "wikilink"). The types that resemble silk are often called
[artificial silk](art_silk "wikilink").

Rayon is manufactured from natural cellulose, and hence is not
considered to be synthetic.[1] Technically, the term [synthetic
fiber](synthetic_fiber "wikilink") is reserved for [fully
synthetic](total_synthesis "wikilink") fibers. In manufacturing terms,
rayon is classified as "a fiber formed by regenerating natural materials
into a usable form".[2] Specific types of rayon include
[viscose](viscose "wikilink"), [modal](Modal_(textile) "wikilink") and
[lyocell](lyocell "wikilink"), each of which differs in the
manufacturing process and the properties of the finished product.

Rayon is made from purified [cellulose](cellulose "wikilink"), harvested
primarily from [wood pulp](wood_pulp "wikilink"), which is chemically
converted into a soluble compound. It is then dissolved and forced
through a [spinneret](spinneret_(polymers) "wikilink") to produce
filaments which are chemically solidified, resulting in fibers of nearly
pure cellulose.[3] Unless the chemicals are handled carefully, workers
can be seriously harmed by the [carbon
disulfide](carbon_disulfide "wikilink") used to manufacture most
rayon.[4][5] To safeguard the workers from the hazards of the chemicals,
new technologies are now applied by the leading manufacturers of viscose
to efficiently capture the emissions and recover and recycle the carbon
disulfide. These technologies have significantly reduced the risks and
have addressed the safety concern related to exposure workers to
chemicals.

## Rayon and its variants

### Nitrocellulose

[Nitrocellulose](Nitrocellulose "wikilink"), a chemical derivative of
cellulose produced with [nitric acid](nitric_acid "wikilink"), was first
discovered in 1832 by [Henri Braconnot](Henri_Braconnot "wikilink") but
was unstably explosive until the 1846 process of [Christian
Schönbein](Christian_Friedrich_Schönbein "wikilink"). The degree of
nitrification determined its explosiveness, solubility in [organic
solvents](organic_solvents "wikilink") such as
[ether](diethyl_ether "wikilink") and [acetone](acetone "wikilink"), and
mechanical properties when dry. Its solubility was the basis for the
first "[artificial silk](artificial_silk "wikilink")" by Georges
Audemars in 1855, which he called "Rayon".

However, [Hilaire de Chardonnet](Hilaire_de_Chardonnet "wikilink") was
the first to patent a nitrocellulose fiber marketed as "artificial silk"
at the [Paris Exhibition of 1889](Paris_Exhibition_of_1889 "wikilink").
Commercial production started in 1891, but the result was
[flammable](flammable "wikilink") and more expensive than cellulose
acetate or [cuprammonium](cuprammonium "wikilink") rayon. Because of
this, production ceased early in the 1900s. Nitrocellulose was briefly
known as "mother-in-law silk".[6]

[Frank Hastings Griffin](Frank_Hastings_Griffin "wikilink") invented the
double-godet, a special stretch-spinning process that changed artificial
silk to rayon, rendering it usable in many industrial products such as
tire cords and clothing. Nathan Rosenstein invented the "spunize
process" by which he turned rayon from a hard fiber to a fabric. This
allowed rayon to become a popular raw material in textiles.

### Acetate

In 1865, Paul Schützenberger discovered that cellulose reacts with
[acetic anhydride](acetic_anhydride "wikilink") to form [cellulose
acetate](cellulose_acetate "wikilink"). The German chemists Arthur
Eichengrün and Theodore Becker invented the first soluble forms of
cellulose acetate in 1903.[7]

By 1910, [Camille Dreyfus](Camille_Dreyfus_(chemist) "wikilink") and his
brother Henri were producing acetate film for the motion picture
industry. In 1913, after some twenty thousand separate experiments, they
produced excellent laboratory samples of continuous filament yarn,
something that had eluded others in the cellulose acetate industry.[8]

After [World War I](World_War_I "wikilink"), attention turned to the
production of acetate fibers. The first yarn was of fair quality, but
sales resistance was heavy, and silk associates worked zealously to
discredit acetate and discourage its use. However, the thermoplastic
nature of acetate made it an excellent fiber for moiré because the
pattern was permanent and did not wash away. The same characteristic
also made permanent pleating a commercial fact for the first time, and
gave great style impetus to the whole dress industry.[9]

Today, acetate is blended with silk, cotton, wool, nylon, etc. to give
fabrics excellent wrinkle recovery, good heft, handle, draping quality,
quick drying, proper dimensional stability, cross-dye pattern potential,
at a very competitive price.[10]

Acetate shares many similarities with [viscose](viscose "wikilink")
rayon, and was formerly considered as the same textile. However, rayon
resists heat while acetate is prone to melting. Acetate must be
laundered with care either by hand-washing or dry cleaning, and acetate
garments disintegrate when heated in a [tumble
dryer](Tumble-dryer "wikilink").[11][12] The two fabrics are now
required to be listed distinctly on garment labels.[13]

Furthermore, viscose rayon production requires [carbon
disulfide](carbon_disulfide "wikilink") in production, while acetate
uses safer solvents such as [acetone](acetone "wikilink"). However,
because viscose rayon is a stronger and more robust fiber than the
otherwise similar acetate, it has come to dominate the market.

[Cellulose triacetate](Cellulose_triacetate "wikilink") is a similar
cellulose derivative to acetate. Acetate fiber is a modified or
secondary acetate having two or more hydroxyl groups; triacetate is a
primary acetate containing no hydroxyl group. Triacetate fibers contain
a higher ratio of acetate-to-cellulose than do acetate fibers.

Triacetate is significantly more heat resistant than cellulose acetate;
articles containing triacetate fibres require little special care, and
are [ironable](ironing "wikilink") up to 200°C.

### Cuprammonium method

Swiss [chemist](chemist "wikilink") [Matthias Eduard
Schweizer](Matthias_Eduard_Schweizer "wikilink") (1818–1860) discovered
that cellulose dissolves in [tetraaminecopper
dihydroxide](Schweizer's_reagent "wikilink"). [Max
Fremery](Max_Fremery "wikilink") and [Johann
Urban](Johann_Urban "wikilink") developed a method to produce [carbon
fibers](Carbon_(fiber) "wikilink") for use in [light
bulbs](light_bulb "wikilink") in 1897.[14] Production of [cuprammonium
rayon](cuprammonium_rayon "wikilink") for
[textiles](textiles "wikilink") started in 1899 in the [Vereinigte
Glanzstoff Fabriken AG](Vereinigte_Glanzstoff_Fabriken_AG "wikilink") in
[Oberbruch](Oberbruch_Industry_Park "wikilink") near
[Aachen](Aachen "wikilink").[15] Improvement by [J. P. Bemberg
AG](J._P._Bemberg_AG "wikilink") in 1904 made the artificial silk a
product comparable to [real silk](silk "wikilink").[16]

### Viscose method

![](Viscose_Rayon_spinning_machine.JPG "fig:Viscose_Rayon_spinning_machine.JPG")
English chemist [Charles Frederick
Cross](Charles_Frederick_Cross "wikilink") and his collaborators,
[Edward John Bevan](Edward_John_Bevan "wikilink") and Clayton Beadle,
patented their artificial silk in 1894. They named their material
"[viscose](viscose "wikilink")" because its production involved the
intermediacy of a highly viscous solution. The process built on the
reaction of [cellulose](cellulose "wikilink") with a strong base,
followed by treatment of that solution with [carbon
disulfide](carbon_disulfide "wikilink") to give a
[xanthate](xanthate "wikilink") derivative. The xanthate is then
converted back to a cellulose fiber in a subsequent step. The first
commercial viscose rayon was produced by the UK company [Courtaulds
Fibres](Courtaulds "wikilink") in 1905. Courtaulds formed an American
division, [American Viscose](American_Viscose_Corporation "wikilink")
(later known as Avtex Fibers), to produce their formulation in the
United States in 1910.[17] The name "rayon" was adopted in 1924, with
"viscose" being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both
rayon and [cellophane](cellophane "wikilink"). In Europe, though, the
fabric itself became known as "viscose", which has been ruled an
acceptable alternative term for rayon by the US [Federal Trade
Commission](Federal_Trade_Commission "wikilink") (FTC).

The viscose method can use wood as a source of cellulose, whereas other
routes to rayon require lignin-free cellulose as starting material. The
use of woody sources of cellulose makes viscose cheaper, so it was
traditionally used on a larger scale than the other methods. On the
other hand, the original viscose process generates large amounts of
contaminated wastewater. Newer technologies use less water and have
improved quality of the wastewater. Rayon was produced only as a
filament fiber until the 1930s, when methods were developed to utilize
"broken waste rayon" as [staple](Staple_(textiles) "wikilink") fiber.

The physical properties of rayon remained unchanged until the
development of high-tenacity rayon in the 1940s. Further research and
development led to high-wet-modulus rayon (HWM rayon) in the 1950s.[18]
Research in the UK was centred on the government-funded [British Rayon
Research Association](British_Rayon_Research_Association "wikilink").

Industrial applications of rayon emerged around 1935. Substituting
cotton fiber in tires and belts, industrial types of rayon developed a
totally different set of properties, amongst which tensile strength and
elastic modulus were paramount.

### Lyocell

The [Lyocell](Lyocell "wikilink") process relies on dissolution of
cellulose products in a solvent, [N-methylmorpholine
N-oxide](N-Methylmorpholine_N-oxide "wikilink"). The process starts with
woody sources of cellulose and involves dry jet-wet spinning. It was
developed at the now defunct American Enka and Courtaulds Fibres.
Lenzing's Tencel and Birla Cellulose's Excel brands are examples of
currently available lyocell fibers.

### Modal

Modal is a type of rayon, a semi-synthetic [cellulose
fiber](cellulose_fiber "wikilink") made by
[spinning](Spinning_(textiles) "wikilink") reconstituted
[cellulose](cellulose "wikilink"). Modal is used alone or with other
fibers (often cotton or [spandex](spandex "wikilink")) in clothing and
household items like pajamas, underwear, bathrobes, towels, and
bedsheets.

Modal is processed under different conditions to produce a fiber that is
stronger and more stable when it is wet than standard rayon, yet has a
soft feel, similar to cotton. It can be [tumble
dried](Clothes_dryer "wikilink") without damage due to its increased
molecular alignment.[19] The fabric has been known to
[pill](Pill_(textile) "wikilink") less than cotton due to fiber
properties and lower surface friction.[20]

Micro-Modal is a variant of Modal textiles. The material is softer than
cotton and has desirable properties that include higher resistance to
shrinking and moisture wicking.

## Major fiber properties

Rayon is a versatile fiber and is widely claimed to have the same
comfort properties as natural fibers, although the drape and
slipperiness of rayon textiles are often more like nylon. It can imitate
the feel and texture of [silk](silk "wikilink"),
[wool](wool "wikilink"), [cotton](cotton "wikilink") and
[linen](linen "wikilink"). The fibers are easily
[dyed](Dyeing "wikilink") in a wide range of colors. Rayon fabrics are
soft, smooth, cool, comfortable, and highly absorbent, but they do not
always insulate body heat, making them ideal for use in hot and humid
climates, although also making their "hand" (feel) cool and sometimes
almost slimy to the touch.[21]

The durability and appearance retention of regular viscose rayon are
low, especially when wet; also, rayon has the lowest elastic recovery of
any fiber. However, HWM rayon (high-wet-modulus rayon) is much stronger
and exhibits higher durability and appearance retention. Recommended
care for regular viscose rayon is dry-cleaning only. HWM rayon can be
machine-washed.[22]

Rayon industrial yarns outperform polyester and are produced for belts
in high performance tires (e.g. Cordenka, Germany).

## Gallery of textures

with a [macro lens](macro_lens "wikilink").
Image:Rayon_closeup_2.jpg\|Another skirt with a different texture.
Image:Rayon_closeup_3.jpg\|A blouse with a texture similar to the
second.

## Physical structure

Regular rayon has lengthwise lines called
[striations](:wikt:striation "wikilink") and its cross-section is an
indented circular shape. The cross-sections of HWM and cupra rayon are
rounder. [Filament](wiktionary:filament "wikilink") rayon
[yarns](yarn "wikilink") vary from 80 to 980
[filaments](wiktionary:filament "wikilink") per [yarn](yarn "wikilink")
and vary in size from 40 to 5000 [denier](Denier_(unit) "wikilink").
[Staple fibers](Staple_(textiles) "wikilink") range from 1.5 to 15
denier and are mechanically or chemically crimped. Rayon fibers are
naturally very bright, but the addition of delustering
[pigments](pigments "wikilink") cuts down on this natural
brightness.[23]

## Production method

![](Cellulose_Haworth.svg "Cellulose_Haworth.svg")

*Regular rayon* (or *viscose*) is the most widely produced form of
rayon. This method of rayon production has been used since the early
1900s and it has the ability to produce either filament or staple
fibers. The process is as follows:

### The steps

1.  ***Cellulose.*** Production begins with processed cellulose
    (obtained from wood pulp and plant fibers). The cellulose content in
    the pulp should be around 87% to 97%.
2.  ***Immersion.*** The cellulose is dissolved in [caustic
    soda](caustic_soda "wikilink"):
    (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)<sub></sub> + NaOH →
    (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>4</sub>ONa)<sub></sub> +
    H<sub>2</sub>O
    is the chemical reaction. The reaction converts cellulose to alkali
    cellulose and removes impurities.
3.  ***Pressing.*** The solution is then pressed between rollers to
    remove excess liquid. The pressing is done in accordance with the
    press-weight ratio. Press weight ratio is the ratio between the
    pressed alkali cellulose sheet weight to the weight of air dried
    pulp. It is adjusted to 2.7-3.[24]
4.  ***"White Crumb."*** The pressed sheets are crumbled or shredded to
    produce what is known as "white crumb."
5.  ***Ageing.*** The "white crumb" is aged through exposure to
    [oxygen](oxygen "wikilink"). This is a depolymerization step and is
    avoided in case of polynosics.
6.  ***"Xanthation."*** The aged "white crumb" is mixed with [carbon
    disulfide](carbon_disulfide "wikilink") in a process known as
    "Xanthation," in which the aged alkali cellulose crumbs are placed
    in vats and are allowed to react with carbon disulfide under
    controlled temperature (20 to 30 °C) to form cellulose xanthate:

    (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>4</sub>ONa)<sub></sub> +
    CS<sub>2</sub> →
    (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>4</sub>O−SC−SNa)<sub></sub>
    is the reaction.
7.  ***"Orange-Yellow Crumb."*** The Xanthation changes the chemical
    makeup of the cellulose mixture, and the resulting product is now
    called "yellow crumb." This orange coloration is due to the
    formation of sodium trithiocarbonate
    (Na<sub>2</sub>CS<sub>3</sub>).[25]
8.  ***Viscose.*** The "yellow crumb" is dissolved in a caustic solution
    to form viscose.
9.  ***Ripening.*** The viscose is set to stand for a period of time,
    allowing it to ripen:

    (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>4</sub>O−SC−SNa)<sub></sub> +
    H<sub>2</sub>O →
    (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)<sub></sub> +
    CS<sub>2</sub> + NaOH
    is the reaction.
10. ***Filtering.*** After ripening, the viscose is filtered to remove
    any undissolved particles.
11. ***Degassing.*** Any bubbles of air are pressed from the viscose in
    a degassing process.
12. ***Extruding.*** The viscose solution is extruded through a
    [spinneret](Spinneret_(polymers) "wikilink"), which resembles a
    shower head with many small holes.
13. ***Acid Bath.*** As the viscose exits the spinneret, it lands in a
    bath of [sulfuric acid](sulfuric_acid "wikilink"), resulting in the
    formation of rayon filaments. The acid is used as a regenerating
    agent. It converts cellulose xanthate back to cellulose. The
    regeneration step is rapid which doesn't allow proper orientation of
    cellulose molecules. So to delay the process of regeneration, zinc
    sulphate is used in the bath which converts cellulose xanthate to
    zinc cellulose xanthate thus providing time for proper orientation
    to take place before regeneration.

    (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>4</sub>O−SC−SNa)<sub></sub> +
    H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> →
    (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)<sub></sub> +
    CS<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
    is the reaction.[26]
14. ***Spinning.*** The spinning of viscose rayon fiber is done using a
    wet spinning process. The filaments are allowed to pass through a
    coagulation bath after extrusion from the spinneret holes. Two-way
    mass transfer takes place.
15. ***Drawing.*** The rayon filaments are stretched, in a procedure
    known as drawing, to straighten out the fibers.
16. ***Washing.*** The fibers are then washed to remove any residual
    chemicals from them.
17. ***Cutting.*** If filament fibers are desired, then the process ends
    here. The filaments are cut down when producing staple fibers.[27]

*High wet modulus rayon (HWM)* is a modified version of viscose that is
stronger when wet. It also has the ability to be
[mercerized](mercerized "wikilink") like cotton. HWM rayons are also
known as "polynosic." Polynosic fibers are dimensionally stable, and do
not shrink or get pulled out of shape when wet like many rayons. They
are also wear resistant and strong while maintaining a soft, silky feel.
They are sometimes identified by the trade name
[Modal](Modal_(textile) "wikilink").[28]

*High-tenacity rayon* is another modified version of viscose that has
almost twice the strength of HWM. This type of rayon is typically used
for industrial purposes such as tire cord.[29]

*Cuprammonium rayon* has properties similar to viscose; however, during
its production, the cellulose is combined with
[copper](copper "wikilink") and [ammonia](ammonia "wikilink")
([Schweizer's reagent](Schweizer's_reagent "wikilink")). Due to the
detrimental environmental effects of this production method,
cuprammonium rayon is no longer produced in the [United
States](United_States "wikilink").[30]

## Environment and sustainability

Highly toxic [carbon disulfide](carbon_disulfide "wikilink") is used in
the production of viscose, leading to many incidents and legal cases[31]
in the early years of viscose technology development. However, the
volatile carbon disulfide is lost before the rayon gets to the consumer;
the rayon itself is basically pure cellulose.[32] Studies from the 1930s
show that 30% of American rayon workers suffered severe effects. Rates
of disability in modern factories (mainly in China, Indonesia and India)
are unknown.[33][34] In the last two decades, new technologies have been
deployed in viscose manufacturing process which are highly efficient in
capturing the carbon disulfide released in the manufacturing process.
The newer technologies referred to as the closed loop manufacturing
process of viscose, can recover most of the sulfur in a usable form and
recycle it. Leading manufacturers of viscose now apply these latest
technologies in the viscose process for effective control of hazards
from these chemicals.

The impact of the textile value chain on the environment has become a
major concern globally. The most important impacts include: millions of
tons of textile waste going to landfill annually, plastic microfibers
flowing into our waterways and oceans, pesticides and fertilizers use on
fiber crops, excessive use of fresh water, greenhouse gas emissions, air
and water pollution and depleted forest cover.

Rayon has historically had many of these issues, especially air and
water pollution and depleted forest cover.  Recently rayon producers
have focused on  sourcing from 100% certified forests and applying
closed-loop manufacturing technologies, limiting the release of
pollutants to water and air. Canopy's [Hot Button
Ranking](https://hotbutton.canopyplanet.org/) offers a detailed overview
of the largest global producers of viscose, ranking their raw material
sourcing practices, documenting their risk of sourcing from Ancient and
Endangered Forests, highlighting research and development investment
towards lower impact fibers and new disruptive innovation, and noting
when producers are showing leadership in supporting global forest
conservation solutions.

Rayon offers an option for designers and consumers looking to enhance
the sustainability attributes of their apparel.  Rayon from leading
manufacturers is fully renewable,
[biodegradable](https://www.edana.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/edana-statement-on-degradability-of-regenerated-cellulose-2018485f3dcdd5286df88968ff0000bfc5c0.pdf?sfvrsn=2),
has reduced the use of water and chemicals, and won’t release
microfibers that collect in waterways and oceans.

## Disposal and biodegradability

The [biodegradability](biodegradation "wikilink") of various fibers in
soil burial and sewage sludge was evaluated by Korean researchers. Rayon
was found to be more biodegradable than cotton, and cotton more than
acetate. The more water-repellent the rayon-based fabric, the more
slowly it will decompose.[35] [Silverfish](Silverfish "wikilink") can
eat rayon. Rayon has been tested and found compostable and
[biodegradable](https://www.edana.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/edana-statement-on-degradability-of-regenerated-cellulose-2018485f3dcdd5286df88968ff0000bfc5c0.pdf?sfvrsn=2)
in soil, aqueous and marine conditions.

A 2014 ocean survey found that rayon contributed to 56.9% of the total
fibers found in [deep ocean](deep_sea "wikilink") areas, the rest being
[polyester](polyester "wikilink"), [polyamides](polyamides "wikilink"),
[acetate](acetate "wikilink") and
[acrylic](acrylic_fiber "wikilink").[36] A 2016 study found a
discrepancy in the ability to identify natural fibers in a marine
environment via [Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy](Fourier_transform_infrared_spectroscopy "wikilink").[37]

## Alternative to cotton

Rising cotton prices in 2010 led clothing makers to begin replacing
[cotton](cotton "wikilink") with rayon in their fabrics. As demand for
rayon increases, companies such as [Fortress
Paper](Fortress_Paper "wikilink") have been investing in [pulp
mills](pulp_mill "wikilink") to increase production. Rayon prices do
vary with changes in supply and demand in the market, however rayon
generally has a price advantage over other natural fibers such as cotton
and silk.[38]

### Mislabelling

*See also [Bamboo textile](Bamboo_textile "wikilink")*

In 2010, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued letters informing over
100 companies that they were mislabeling products made of rayon as being
made from [bamboo](bamboo "wikilink"), deceiving environmentally
conscious consumers.[39] In 2015, the FTC filed complaints against Bed
Bath & Beyond, Nordstrom, J.C. Penney, Backcountry.com, and their
subsidiaries, for continuing to deceptively sell rayon mislabeled as
bamboo. The four companies were required to pay civil penalties totaling
for violating the "Textile Act and the Textile Rules" and Section
5(m)(1)(B) of the FTC Act.[40] Similar action took place in Canada.[41]

### Impact on U.S. textile industry

Rayon contributed partly to the decline of the US [textile
industry](textile_industry "wikilink") in the 1920s.[42] It is far
cheaper to produce than wool, cotton, or silk. It also requires less
processing and hence fewer workers. In addition, it was 50% cheaper than
silk during the 1920s in the US.[43] Then, it was used initially for
men's socks but later for [lingerie](lingerie "wikilink") and women's
[stockings](stockings "wikilink").[44] Currently rayon is only 5-6% of
the total fibers used in the [global textile
industry](https://www.statista.com/statistics/741296/world-fiber-consumption-distribution-by-fiber-type/),
which is dominated by polyester and cotton.

## Producers

In 2018, viscose fiber production in the world was approximately 5.8
million tons, and [China](China "wikilink") was the largest producer
with about 65% of total global production[45]. [Trade
names](Trade_name "wikilink") are used within the rayon industry to
label the type of rayon in the product. Viscose Rayon was first produced
in Coventry England in 1905 by Courtaulds.

*Bemberg* is a trade name for [cupramonium
rayon](cuprammonium_rayon "wikilink") developed by [J. P.
Bemberg](Bemberg "wikilink"). Bemberg performs much like viscose but has
a smaller diameter and comes closest to silk in feel. Bemberg is no
longer produced in [Italy](Italy "wikilink"), but is still produced in
Japan, due to [United States Environmental Protection
Agency](United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency "wikilink")
regulations in the US. The fibers are finer than viscose rayon.[46]

*[Modal](Modal_(textile) "wikilink")* and *[Tencel](Tencel "wikilink")*
are widely used forms of rayon produced by primarily by [Lenzing
AG](Lenzing_AG "wikilink") and [Birla
Cellulose](http://www.birlacellulose.com/index.php). Tencel, generic
name *lyocell*, is made by a slightly different solvent recovery
process, and is considered a different fiber by the US FTC. Lyocell is
made by a slightly different solvent recovery process and is considered
a different fiber by the US Federal Trade Commission. Tencel lyocell was
first produced commercially by [Courtaulds' Grimsby
plant](Courtaulds,_Grimsby "wikilink") in England. The process, which
dissolves cellulose without a chemical reaction, was developed by
Courtaulds Research.

[Accordis](AkzoNobel#Fibres "wikilink") was a major manufacturer of
cellulose based fibers and yarns. Production facilities can be found
throughout Europe, the U.S. and [Brazil](Brazil "wikilink").[47]

*Visil rayon* and HOPE FR are [flame
retardant](flame_retardant "wikilink") forms of viscose that have
[silica](Silicon_dioxide "wikilink") embedded in the fiber during
manufacturing.

[North American Rayon
Corporation](North_American_Rayon_Corporation "wikilink") of
[Tennessee](Tennessee "wikilink") produced viscose rayon until its
closure in the year 2000.[48][49]

[Birla Cellolose](http://www.birlacellulose.com/index.php) of
[India](India "wikilink") is one of the largest producers of rayon,
model and lyocell in the world. It has plants in
[Nagda](Nagda "wikilink"), [Kharach](Kharach "wikilink"), Vilayat, and
[Harihar](Harihar "wikilink") – and one each in Thailland, Indonesia and
China along with pulp facilities in Canada and Sweden.

[Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink") is one of the largest producers of
rayon in the world, and [Asia Pacific
Rayon](Asia_Pacific_Rayon "wikilink") (APR) of the country has annual
production capacity of 0.24 million tons[50].

colbond.us. Acordis was a spinoff by [AkzoNobel](AkzoNobel "wikilink")
in 2000 after it had acquired [Courtaulds](Courtaulds "wikilink"). It
was through [AkzoNobel](AkzoNobel "wikilink")'s original parent
company's, the *Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek* (ENKA), joint venture
with *Rento Hofstede Crull* 's *De Vijf*, named *De Internationale
Spinpot Exploitatie Maatschappij* (*ISEM*) that the commercial
production of rayon was made viable. Hofstede Crull had supplied the
solution for the problem of manufacturing rayon with his *Driving Device
For A Centrifugal Spinning Machine* in 1925 (1931 ). The *ISEM* was
fully integrated with the *Algemene Kunstzijde Unie*, the Nederlandse
Kunstzijdefabriek's successor, with the death of Hofstede Crull in 1938.
