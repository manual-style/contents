**Russell cord** is a finely corded fabric, generally constructed with a
cotton [warp](/Warp_(weaving) "wikilink") and
[worsted](/worsted "wikilink") [weft](/weft "wikilink") (filling). Two
or more warp threads are woven together to form the cord, thus the cord
lines run warp-wise.[1] Russell cord is visually similar to a very
narrow-waled [corduroy](/corduroy "wikilink") called pincord, but it is
heavier and more sturdy. It is usually woven using 40%
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink") and 60% [wool](/wool "wikilink") (or
similar compositions depending on the weaver). It is mainly used in the
making of high quality black [academical
dress](/academical_dress "wikilink"), as well as [clerical
dress](/clerical_dress "wikilink") and [legal
dress](/legal_dress "wikilink") in the [United
Kingdom](/United_Kingdom "wikilink"). It is woven using thicker strands
so is heavier than [princetta](/princetta "wikilink").

Russell cord is a hardwearing fabric and generally keeps its shape for
many years, unlike cotton or [polyester](/polyester "wikilink") which
creases easily.
