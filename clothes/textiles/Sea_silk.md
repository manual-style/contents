**Sea silk** is an extremely fine, rare, and valuable
[fabric](textile "wikilink") that is made from the long silky filaments
or [byssus](byssus "wikilink") secreted by a gland in the foot of [pen
shells](Pinnidae "wikilink") (in particular *[Pinna
nobilis](Pinna_nobilis "wikilink")*).[1] The byssus is used by the clam
to attach itself to the sea bed.[2]

Sea silk was produced in the [Mediterranean](Mediterranean "wikilink")
region from the large marine [bivalve](bivalve "wikilink")
[mollusc](mollusc "wikilink") *Pinna nobilis* until early in the 20th
century. The shell, which is sometimes almost a metre long, adheres
itself to rocks with a tuft of very strong thin fibres, pointed end
down, in the [intertidal zone](intertidal_zone "wikilink"). These byssi
or filaments (which can be up to 6 cm long) are spun and, when treated
with [lemon](lemon "wikilink") juice, turn a golden colour, which never
fades.[3]

The cloth produced from these filaments can be woven even finer than
silk, and is extremely light and warm; it was said that a pair of
women's gloves made from the fabric could fit into half a
[walnut](walnut "wikilink") shell and a pair of stockings in a
[snuffbox](snuffbox "wikilink").[4][5] The cloth attracts [clothes
moths](clothes_moth "wikilink"), the larvae of which will eat it.

In addition, *Pinna nobilis* is also sometimes gathered for its flesh
(as food) and occasionally has [pearls](pearl "wikilink") of fair
quality.

## History

### Egypt

The Greek text of the (196 BCE) [Rosetta
Stone](Rosetta_Stone "wikilink") records that [Ptolemy
V](Ptolemy_V "wikilink") reduced taxes on priests, including one paid in
*byssus* cloth. This is thought to be fine [linen](linen "wikilink")
cloth,[6] not sea silk. In [Ancient Egyptian burial
customs](Ancient_Egyptian_burial_customs "wikilink"), *byssus* was used
to wrap [mummies](mummy "wikilink"); this was also linen and not sea
silk.

### Greece

The [sophist](sophist "wikilink") author
[Alciphron](Alciphron "wikilink") first records "sea wool" in his (c.
2nd century CE) "Galenus to Cryton" letter.[7]

The early Christian [Tertullian](Tertullian "wikilink") (c. 160–220 CE)
mentions it when justifying his wearing a
[pallium](Pallium_(Roman_cloak) "wikilink") instead of a
[toga](toga "wikilink").

> Nor was it enough to comb and to sew the materials for a tunic. It was
> necessary also to fish for one's dress; for fleeces are obtained from
> the sea where shells of extraordinary size are furnished with tufts of
> mossy hair.[8]

Sea silk has been suggested as an interpretation of the nature of the
[golden fleece](golden_fleece "wikilink") that was sought by [Jason and
the Argonauts](Jason "wikilink")[9] but scholars reject this
hypothesis.[10]

### Roman Empire

Several sources mention *lana pinna* "pinna wool". Emperor
[Diocletian](Diocletian "wikilink")'s (301 CE) *[Edict on Maximum
Prices](Edict_on_Maximum_Prices "wikilink")* lists it as a valuable
textile.[11]

The Byzantine historian [Procopius](Procopius "wikilink")'s (c. 550 CE)
*Persian War*, "stated that the five hereditary
[satraps](satrap "wikilink") (governors) of Armenia who received their
insignia from the Roman Emperor were given [chlamys](chlamys "wikilink")
(or cloaks) made from *lana pinna*. Apparently only the ruling classes
were allowed to wear these chlamys."[12]

### Arabia

The [Arabic](Arabic_(language) "wikilink") name for "sea silk" is *ṣūf
al-baḥr* "sea wool". The 9th-century Persian geographer
[Estakhri](Estakhri "wikilink") notes that a sea-wool robe cost more
than 1000 gold pieces and records its mythic source.

> At a certain period of the year an animal is seen running out of the
> sea and rubbing itself against certain stones of the littoral,
> whereupon it deposes a kind of wool of silken hue and golden colour.
> This wool is very rare and highly esteemed, and nothing of it is
> allowed to waste.[13]

Two 13th-century authors, [Ibn al-Baitar](Ibn_al-Baitar "wikilink") and
[Zakariya al-Qazwini](Zakariya_al-Qazwini "wikilink"), repeat this
inaccurate "sea wool" story.

### China

Beginning in the [Eastern Han](Eastern_Han "wikilink") dynasty (25–220
CE), Chinese histories document importing sea silk. [Chinese
language](Chinese_language "wikilink") names include "cloth from the
west of the sea" and "mermaid silk".

The (3rd century CE) *[Weilüe](Weilüe "wikilink")* "Brief Account of the
Wei", which was an unofficial history of the [Cao
Wei](Cao_Wei "wikilink") empire (220-265 CE), records
*[haixi](Roman_Egypt "wikilink")* 海西 "West of the Sea" cloth made from
*shuiyang* 水羊 "water sheep".[14]

> They have fine brocaded cloth that is said to be made from the down of
> "water-sheep". It is called *Haixi* ("Egyptian") cloth. This country
> produces the six domestic animals \[traditionally: horses, cattle,
> sheep, chickens, dogs and pigs\], which are all said to come from the
> water. It is said that they not only use sheep's wool, but also bark
> from trees, or the silk from wild silkworms, to make brocade, mats,
> pile rugs, woven cloth and curtains, all of them of good quality, and
> with brighter colours than those made in the countries of Haidong
> (*East of the Sea*).[15]

The (c. 5th century CE) *[Hou Hanshu](Hou_Hanshu "wikilink")* "Book of
the Eastern Han" expresses doubt about "water sheep" in the "Products of
[Daqin](Daqin "wikilink") (the Roman Empire)" section. "They also have a
fine cloth which some people say is made from the down of 'water sheep,'
but which is made, in fact, from the cocoons of [wild
silkworms](wild_silk "wikilink")".[16] The historian [Fan
Ye](Fan_Ye_(historian) "wikilink") (398–445 CE), author of the *Hou
Hanshu*, notes this section's information comes from the report that
General [Ban Yong](Ban_Yong "wikilink") 班勇 (son of General [Ban
Chao](Ban_Chao "wikilink") 班超, 32-102 CE) presented to the Emperor in
125. Both Bans administered the [Western
Regions](Western_Regions "wikilink") on the [Silk
Road](Silk_Road "wikilink").

The (945 CE) *[Tang shu](Old_Book_of_Tang "wikilink")* "Book of Tang"
mentioned *Haixi* cloth from Folin 佛菻
"[Syria](Byzantine_Syria "wikilink")", which [Emil
Bretschneider](Emil_Bretschneider "wikilink") first identified as sea
silk from Greece. "There is also a stuff woven from the hair of
sea-sheep, and called *hai si pu* (stuff from the western sea)". He
notes, "This is, perhaps, the *Byssus*, a clothstuff woven up to the
present time by the Mediterranean coast, especially in Southern Italy,
from the thread-like excrescences of several sea-shells, (especially
*[Pinna nobilis](Pinna_nobilis "wikilink")*)."[17]

The (early 6th century CE) *Shuyiji* 遹異記 "Records of Strange Things"
mentions silk woven by *Jiaoren* 蛟人
[*jiao*](Jiaolong "wikilink")-dragon people", which [Edward H.
Schafer](Edward_H._Schafer "wikilink") identifies as sea silk.

> In the midst of the South Sea are the houses of the *kău* people who
> dwell in the water like fish, but have not given up weaving at the
> loom. Their eyes have the power to weep, but what they bring forth is
> pearls.[18]

This aquatic type of raw silk was called *jiaoxiao* 蛟綃, i.e. "mermaid
silk" or *jiaonujuan*蛟女絹, "mermaid women's silk".

### Modern

The earliest usage of the English name *sea silk* remains uncertain, but
the *[Oxford English Dictionary](Oxford_English_Dictionary "wikilink")*
defines *sea-silkworm* as "a bivalve mollusc of the genus *Pinna*."[19]

[Alexander Serov](Alexander_Serov "wikilink")'s 1863 opera
*[Judith](Judith_(Serov) "wikilink")* includes an aria "I shall don my
robe of byssus" (Я оденусь в виссон).[20][21]

In [Jules Verne](Jules_Verne "wikilink")'s 1870 novel *[20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea](20,000_Leagues_Under_the_Sea "wikilink")*, the crew of
the Nautilus wear clothes made of byssus (alternately translated as
"seashell tissue" or "fan-mussel fabric").[22]

*Pinna nobilis* has become threatened with extinction, partly due to
overfishing, the decline in [seagrass](seagrass "wikilink") fields, and
pollution. As it has declined so dramatically, the once small but
vibrant sea silk industry has almost disappeared, and the art is now
preserved only by a few women on the island of
[Sant'Antioco](Sant'Antioco "wikilink") near
[Sardinia](Sardinia "wikilink"). Chiara Vigo claimed on various media to
be the sole person living today to master the art of working with
byssus[23][24] and the local people helped her to open the Sea Silk
Museum in Sant'Antioco which was closed following a building code
dispute with the local government.[25] "Project Sea-Silk" from the
[Natural History Museum of
Basel](Natural_History_Museum_of_Basel "wikilink")[26] is collecting
extensive data and studies on the subject, and informs the public that a
couple of other women still produce and work today with byssus in
Sant'Antioco in Sardinia, such as the sisters Assuntina e Giuseppina Pes
which contradicts the claims of Chiara Vigo who is credited as having
"invented with an extraordinary imagination her own story of sea-silk
and \[spinning\] it tirelessly and to the delight of all media on and
on".[27] In 2013, Efisia Murroni, a 100 year old sea-silk master weaver
nicknamed "la signora del bisso" (born in 1913) died and her work is now
shown in the Museo Etnografico di Sant'Antioco, with other artefacts
being already on display in various museums throughout Europe.[28]
