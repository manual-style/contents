Seal skins have been used by aboriginal people for millennia to make
waterproof jackets and boots, and seal fur to make [fur
coats](fur_coat "wikilink"). Sailors used to have [tobacco
pouches](tobacco_pouches "wikilink") made from sealskin.
[Canada](Canada "wikilink"), [Greenland](Greenland "wikilink"),
[Norway](Norway "wikilink"), [Russia](Russia "wikilink") and
[Namibia](Namibia "wikilink") all export sealskin. It was traditionally
used to make [Scottish](Scotland "wikilink")
[sporrans](sporran "wikilink").

The [Inuit](Inuit "wikilink") people indigenous to Canada and Alaska
argue that banning seal products is detrimental to their way of life.[1]
However, there are many objections to the use of seal skin, fur and
pelts, and it is illegal to hunt seals in many countries, particularly
young seals. The value of global sealskin exports in 2006 was over 16
million Canadian dollars.[2]

**Pinseal** is the term for sealskin [leather](leather "wikilink").
