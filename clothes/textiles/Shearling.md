**Shearling** is a skin from a recently shorn [sheep](sheep "wikilink")
or lamb that has been [tanned](Tanning_(leather) "wikilink") and dressed
with the [wool](wool "wikilink") left on.[1] It has a
[suede](suede "wikilink") surface on one side and a clipped fur surface
on the other. Usually the suede side is worn outward. Real shearling
breathes and is more flexible, much heavier in weight and the fur is
much denser than synthetic. Synthetic shearling fur is typically called
sherpa. Synthetic or fake shearling has a bit of a sheen to its outer
while real shearling outer hide is dull and a bit tacky to the touch.
Genuine shearling is also smoother to the touch than synthetic
shearling.[2] [3] [4] .
