![](Sheep_skin_for_sale.jpg "fig:Sheep_skin_for_sale.jpg") **Sheepskin**
is the [hide](Hide_(skin) "wikilink") of a
[sheep](Domestic_sheep "wikilink"), sometimes also called **lambskin**.
Unlike common [leather](leather "wikilink"), sheepskin is
[tanned](Tanning_(leather) "wikilink") with the
[fleece](Wool "wikilink") intact, as in a [pelt](Fur "wikilink").[1]

## Uses

![](SuperUgg.JPG "fig:SuperUgg.JPG") Sheepskin is used to produce
sheepskin leather products and soft [wool](wool "wikilink")-lined
clothing or coverings, including gloves, hats,
[slippers](slippers "wikilink"), [footstools](footstool "wikilink"),
automotive seat covers, baby and invalid rugs and pelts. Sheepskin
numnahs, saddle pads, saddle seat covers, sheepskin horse boots, tack
linings and girth tubes are also made and used in
[equestrianism](equestrianism "wikilink").[2][3]

The fleece of sheepskin has excellent insulating properties and it is
also resistant to flame and static electricity. Wool is considered by
the medical profession to be
[hypoallergenic](hypoallergenic "wikilink").[4] Sheepskin is a natural
insulator, and draws perspiration away from the wearer and into the
fibers. There, it traps between 30 and 36 percent of its own weight in
moisture.

Testing at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the
[CSIRO](CSIRO "wikilink") Textile and Fibre Technology Leather Research
Centre confirmed the advantages of medical sheepskin in the prevention
and treatment of pressure ulcers.[5]

Sheepskin coats, vests, and [boots](sheepskin_boots "wikilink") are
common in the traditional dress of peoples throughout the Old World
(wherever sheep are raised). They seem to be especially popular in the
steppes of Eastern European and Northern Asia, and according to the
French knight [Robert de Clari](Robert_de_Clari "wikilink"), they were
part of the [national costume](national_costume "wikilink") of the
[Cuman people](Cuman_people "wikilink") who lived there circa 1200CE. In
Ukraine a sheepskin coat is called a *[kozhukh](kozhukh "wikilink")* and
a vest a *[kozhushanka](kozhushanka "wikilink")* are an iconic part of
the national costume, while in Russia the same coat was usually called
*tulup*. In Spain such a coat is called a
*[zamarra](zamarra_(coat) "wikilink")*, in Tibet a
*[chuba](chuba "wikilink")*, in Kazakh a
[*ton*](Kazakh_clothing "wikilink"), in Romania a
[*cojoc*](Suciu_(disambiguation) "wikilink"),. In the English-speaking
world, one may speak of a [shearling coat](shearling_coat "wikilink").
During the 1970s in Britain the [suedehead
subculture](Suedehead_(subculture) "wikilink") adopted this item as an
identifying fashion, and it also had some popularity with
[hippies](hippies "wikilink") in North America. Sheepskin-lined [Ugg
boots](Ugg_boot "wikilink") became popular worldwide in the late 1990s.

The use of sheepskin seat covers in moving vehicles dates back
centuries,[6] perhaps as long ago as the [Bronze
Age](Bronze_Age "wikilink"), when wagons and carriages were first used.
The more sophisticated, tailor-made sheepskin [car
seat](car_seat "wikilink") covers of the modern era have been popular in
Europe for decades, and grew in great popularity in the United States in
the mid 1970s.[7]

## Quality

The quality of the skin used in each application depends on several
factors, mostly whether the pelt, which is the back of the hide, will be
visible or not. Where the pelt is visible, better quality hide with
minimal seed will be used.

Seed contamination is where patches of scar tissue remain, resulting
from a healed seed burrow wound during the animal's life. This scar
tissue can fall out leaving small holes after the pelt is processed or
it can remain in place leaving imperfections in the pelt which cannot be
corrected. Seed contamination is graded as follows:[8]

1.  "No Visible Seed" - Visually free of seed contamination. This does
    not however mean the skin is completely free of seed, only visually
    free.
2.  "Light Seed" - Slight seed contamination visible in the wool but
    minimal mainly concentrated in the belly regions.
3.  "Medium Seed" - Light seed contamination is present over most of the
    wool surface but is concentrated around the belly area and the legs.
4.  "Heavy Seed" - Heavy contamination extending through the majority of
    the wool but especially prevalent around the belly area and the
    legs.
5.  "Burry" - Wool contaminated with hard seed. Can vary from light to
    heavy concentration. This level of seed can cause problems if it is
    not removed before fleshing starts as the rollers can sometimes
    punch them through the skin.

In general, wool affected by skin diseases is not usable. Other problems
include louse infestation, dead wool and regrowth.

Skins are classed, packed and sold in standardized wool lengths:

-   Bares (newly shorn)
-   1/8"–1/4" (3 mm–7 mm)
-   1/4"–1/2" (7 mm–13 mm)
-   1/2"–1" (13 mm–26 mm)
-   1"–2" (26 mm 55 mm)
-   2"–4" (55 mm–110 mm) (Full wools)

## Mouton fur

Mouton fur (North America) or beaver lamb (UK) is sheepskin which has
been processed to resemble beaver or seal fur[9] ( is
[French](French_language "wikilink") for "sheep"). Mouton fur is
lambskin whose hair has been straightened, chemically treated, and
thermally set to produce a moisture-repellent finish. Mouton is often
dyed brown to resemble beaver, but it is also made in many other colors.
