**Silk** is a natural [protein](protein "wikilink")
[fiber](fiber "wikilink"), some forms of which can be
[woven](weaving "wikilink") into [textiles](textile "wikilink"). The
protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of
[fibroin](fibroin "wikilink") and is produced by certain insect larvae
to form cocoons.[1] The best-known silk is obtained from the
[cocoons](Cocoon_(silk) "wikilink") of the [larvae](larva "wikilink") of
the [mulberry](mulberry "wikilink")
[silkworm](silkworm "wikilink")*[Bombyx mori](Bombyx_mori "wikilink")''
reared in captivity ([sericulture](sericulture "wikilink")). The
shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular
[prism](prism_(optics) "wikilink")-like structure of the silk fibre,
which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different
[angles](angle "wikilink"), thus producing different colors.

Silk is produced by several insects; but, generally, only the silk of
moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing. There has
been some research into other types of silk, which differ at the
molecular level.[2] Silk is mainly produced by the
[larvae](larva "wikilink") of insects undergoing [complete
metamorphosis](Holometabolism "wikilink"), but some insects, such as
[webspinners](webspinner "wikilink") and [raspy
crickets](Gryllacrididae "wikilink"), produce silk throughout their
lives.[3] Silk production also occurs in
[Hymenoptera](Hymenoptera "wikilink") ([bees](bee "wikilink"),
[wasps](wasp "wikilink"), and [ants](ant "wikilink")),
[silverfish](silverfish "wikilink"), [mayflies](mayfly "wikilink"),
[thrips](thrips "wikilink"), [leafhoppers](leafhopper "wikilink"),
[beetles](beetle "wikilink"), [lacewings](lacewing "wikilink"),
[fleas](flea "wikilink"), [flies](fly "wikilink"), and
[midges](midge "wikilink").[4] Other types of
[arthropods](arthropod "wikilink") produce silk, most notably various
[arachnids](arachnid "wikilink"), such as [spiders](spider "wikilink").

## Etymology

The word silk comes from , from , "silken", ultimately from an Asian
source — compare [Mandarin](Standard_Chinese "wikilink") "silk",
[Manchurian](Manchu_language "wikilink") ,
[Mongolian](Mongolian_language "wikilink") .[5]

## History

### Wild silk

![](Silk_from_Mawangdui_2.jpg "fig:Silk_from_Mawangdui_2.jpg") in
[Changsha](Changsha "wikilink"), [Hunan](Hunan "wikilink") province,
[China](China "wikilink"), from the [Western Han
dynasty](Han_dynasty "wikilink"), 2nd century BC\]\]Several kinds of
[wild silk](wild_silk "wikilink"), produced by
[caterpillars](caterpillar "wikilink") other than the
[mulberry](mulberry "wikilink") silkworm, have been known and spun in
[China](China "wikilink"), [South Asia](South_Asia "wikilink"), and
[Europe](Europe "wikilink") since ancient times. However, the scale of
production was always far smaller than for cultivated silks. There are
several reasons for this: first, they differ from the domesticated
varieties in colour and [texture](wikt:texture "wikilink") and are
therefore less uniform; second, cocoons gathered in the wild have
usually had the pupa emerge from them before being discovered so the
silk thread that makes up the cocoon has been torn into shorter lengths;
and third, many wild cocoons are covered in a mineral layer that
prevents attempts to reel from them long strands of silk.[6] Thus, the
only way to obtain silk suitable for spinning into textiles in areas
where commercial silks are not cultivated was by tedious and
labor-intensive [carding](carding "wikilink").

Some natural silk structures have been used without being unwound or
spun. Spider webs were used as a wound dressing in ancient Greece and
Rome,[7] and as a base for [painting](Cobweb_painting "wikilink") from
the 16th century.[8] Caterpillar nests were pasted together to make a
fabric in the [Aztec Empire](Aztec_Empire "wikilink").[9]

Commercial silks originate from reared silkworm pupae, which are bred to
produce a white-colored silk thread with no mineral on the surface. The
pupae are killed by either dipping them in boiling water before the
adult moths emerge or by piercing them with a needle. These factors all
contribute to the ability of the whole cocoon to be unravelled as one
continuous thread, permitting a much stronger cloth to be woven from the
silk. Wild silks also tend to be more difficult to dye than silk from
the cultivated silkworm.[10][11] A technique known as
[demineralizing](Demineralizing_(silk_worm_cocoon) "wikilink") allows
the mineral layer around the cocoon of wild silk moths to be
removed,[12] leaving only variability in color as a barrier to creating
a commercial silk industry based on wild silks in the parts of the world
where wild silk moths thrive, such as in Africa and South America.

### China

![](Meister_nach_Chang_Hsüan_001.jpg "fig:Meister_nach_Chang_Hsüan_001.jpg").\]\]![](Portrait_of_Eshing.jpg "fig:Portrait_of_Eshing.jpg"),
from [Peabody Essex Museum](Peabody_Essex_Museum "wikilink")\]\] Silk
was first developed in ancient China.[13][14] The earliest evidence for
silk is the presence of the silk protein [fibroin](fibroin "wikilink")
in soil samples from two tombs at the [neolithic](neolithic "wikilink")
site [Jiahu](Jiahu "wikilink") in [Henan](Henan "wikilink"), which date
back about 8,500 years.[15][16] The earliest surviving example of silk
fabric dates from about 3630 BC, and was used as the wrapping for the
body of a child at a [Yangshao culture](Yangshao_culture "wikilink")
site in Qingtaicun near [Xingyang](Xingyang "wikilink"), Henan.[17][18]

Legend gives credit for developing silk to a Chinese empress,
[Leizu](Leizu "wikilink") (Hsi-Ling-Shih, Lei-Tzu). Silks were
originally reserved for the Emperors of China for their own use and
gifts to others, but spread gradually through [Chinese
culture](Chinese_culture "wikilink") and trade both geographically and
socially, and then to many regions of [Asia](Asia "wikilink"). Because
of its texture and lustre, silk rapidly became a popular luxury fabric
in the many areas accessible to Chinese merchants. Silk was in great
demand, and became a staple of
pre-[industrial](industrial_revolution "wikilink") international
[trade](trade "wikilink"). In July 2007, archaeologists discovered
intricately woven and dyed silk [textiles](textile "wikilink") in a tomb
in [Jiangxi](Jiangxi "wikilink") province, dated to the Eastern [Zhou
dynasty](Zhou_dynasty "wikilink") roughly 2,500 years ago.[19] Although
historians have suspected a long history of a formative textile industry
in ancient China, this find of silk textiles employing "complicated
techniques" of weaving and dyeing provides direct evidence for silks
dating before the [Mawangdui](Mawangdui "wikilink")-discovery and other
silks dating to the [Han dynasty](Han_dynasty "wikilink") (202 BC – 220
AD).[20]

Silk is described in a chapter of the *[Fan Shengzhi
shu](Fan_Shengzhi_shu "wikilink")* from the Western Han (202 BC – 9 AD).
There is a surviving calendar for silk production in an Eastern Han
(25–220 AD) document. The two other known works on silk from the Han
period are lost.[21] The first evidence of the long distance silk trade
is the finding of silk in the hair of an [Egyptian](Egypt "wikilink")
[mummy](mummy "wikilink") of the 21st dynasty, c.1070 BC.[22] The silk
trade reached as far as the [Indian
subcontinent](Indian_subcontinent "wikilink"), the [Middle
East](Middle_East "wikilink"), [Europe](Europe "wikilink"), and [North
Africa](North_Africa "wikilink"). This trade was so extensive that the
major set of trade routes between Europe and Asia came to be known as
the [Silk Road](Silk_Road "wikilink").

The [Emperors of China](Emperors_of_China "wikilink") strove to keep
knowledge of [sericulture](sericulture "wikilink") secret to maintain
the Chinese [monopoly](monopoly "wikilink"). Nonetheless sericulture
reached [Korea](Korea "wikilink") with technological aid from China
around 200 BC,[23] the ancient [Kingdom of
Khotan](Kingdom_of_Khotan "wikilink") by AD 50,[24] and India by AD
140.[25]

In the ancient era, silk from China was the most lucrative and
sought-after luxury item traded across the Eurasian continent,[26] and
many civilizations, such as the ancient Persians, benefited economically
from trade.[27]

### India

![](Silk_Sari_Weaving_at_Kanchipuram,_Tamil_Nadu.jpg "fig:Silk_Sari_Weaving_at_Kanchipuram,_Tamil_Nadu.jpg")
weaving at Kanchipuram\]\] Silk has a long history in India. It is known
as *Resham* in eastern and north India, and *Pattu* in southern parts of
[India](India "wikilink"). Recent archaeological discoveries in
[Harappa](Harappa "wikilink") and [Chanhu-daro](Chanhu-daro "wikilink")
suggest that [sericulture](sericulture "wikilink"), employing [wild
silk](wild_silk "wikilink") threads from native
[silkworm](silkworm "wikilink") species, existed in [South
Asia](South_Asia "wikilink") during the time of the [Indus Valley
Civilization](Indus_Valley_Civilization "wikilink") (now in
[Pakistan](Pakistan "wikilink")) dating between 2450 BC and 2000 BC,
while "hard and fast evidence" for silk production in China dates back
to around 2570 BC.[28][29] Shelagh Vainker, a silk expert at the
[Ashmolean Museum](Ashmolean_Museum "wikilink") in Oxford, who sees
evidence for silk production in China "significantly earlier" than
2500–2000 BC, suggests, "people of the Indus civilization either
harvested silkworm cocoons or traded with people who did, and that they
knew a considerable amount about silk."[30]

India is the second largest producer of silk in the world after China.
About 97% of the raw mulberry silk comes from six Indian states, namely,
[Andhra Pradesh](Andhra_Pradesh "wikilink"),
[Karnataka](Karnataka "wikilink"), [Jammu and
Kashmir](Jammu_and_Kashmir "wikilink"), [Tamil
Nadu](Tamil_Nadu "wikilink"), [Bihar](Bihar "wikilink") and [West
Bengal](West_Bengal "wikilink").[31] North Bangalore, the upcoming site
of a $20 million "Silk City" [Ramanagara](Ramanagara "wikilink") and
[Mysore](Mysore "wikilink"), contribute to a majority of silk production
in Karnataka.[32]
![](Antheraea_assama_from_Assam.jpg "fig:Antheraea_assama_from_Assam.jpg")

![](Saree_on_display_at_Dilli_Haat.JPG "fig:Saree_on_display_at_Dilli_Haat.JPG")
with gold [brocade](brocade "wikilink")\]\]In [Tamil
Nadu](Tamil_Nadu "wikilink"), mulberry cultivation is concentrated in
the [Coimbatore](Coimbatore "wikilink"), [Erode](Erode "wikilink"),
[Bhagalpuri](Bhagalpur "wikilink"), [Tiruppur](Tiruppur "wikilink"),
[Salem](Salem_district "wikilink") and
[Dharmapuri](Dharmapuri "wikilink") districts.
[Hyderabad](Hyderabad,_India "wikilink"), [Andhra
Pradesh](Andhra_Pradesh "wikilink"), and
[Gobichettipalayam](Gobichettipalayam "wikilink"), [Tamil
Nadu](Tamil_Nadu "wikilink"), were the first locations to have automated
silk reeling units in India.[33]

India is also the largest consumer of silk in the world. The tradition
of wearing silk sarees for marriages and other auspicious ceremonies is
a custom in Assam and southern parts of India. Silk is considered to be
a symbol of royalty, and, historically, silk was used primarily by the
upper classes. Silk garments and [sarees](saree "wikilink") produced in
[Kanchipuram](Kanchipuram "wikilink"),
[Pochampally](Bhoodhan_Pochampally "wikilink"),
[Dharmavaram](Dharmavaram,_Anantapur "wikilink"),
[Mysore](Mysore "wikilink"), [Arani](Arni,_Tiruvannamalai "wikilink") in
the south, [Banaras](Banaras "wikilink") in the north,
[Bhagalpur](Bhagalpur "wikilink") and
[Murshidabad](Murshidabad "wikilink") in the east are well recognized.
In the northeastern state of [Assam](Assam "wikilink"), three different
types of silk are produced, collectively called [Assam
silk](Assam_silk "wikilink"): Muga, Eri and Pat silk. Muga, the golden
silk, and Eri are produced by silkworms that are native only to Assam.

### Thailand

Silk is produced year-round in Thailand by two types of silkworms, the
cultured Bombycidae and wild Saturniidae. Most production is after the
rice harvest in the southern and northeastern parts of the country.
Women traditionally weave silk on hand looms and pass the skill on to
their daughters, as weaving is considered to be a sign of maturity and
eligibility for marriage. Thai silk textiles often use complicated
patterns in various colours and styles. Most regions of Thailand have
their own typical silks. A single thread [filament](fiber "wikilink") is
too thin to use on its own so women combine many threads to produce a
thicker, usable fiber. They do this by hand-reeling the threads onto a
wooden spindle to produce a uniform strand of raw silk. The process
takes around 40 hours to produce a half kilogram of silk. Many local
operations use a reeling machine for this task, but some silk threads
are still hand-reeled. The difference is that hand-reeled threads
produce three grades of silk: two fine grades that are ideal for
lightweight fabrics, and a thick grade for heavier material.

The silk fabric is soaked in extremely cold water and bleached before
dyeing to remove the natural yellow coloring of Thai silk yarn. To do
this, skeins of silk thread are immersed in large tubs of [hydrogen
peroxide](hydrogen_peroxide "wikilink"). Once washed and dried, the silk
is woven on a traditional hand-operated loom.[34]

fibers, [Rajshahi](Rajshahi "wikilink").\]\]

The [Rajshahi Division](Rajshahi_Division "wikilink") of northern
Bangladesh is the hub of the country's silk industry. There are three
types of silk produced in the region: mulberry, endi and tassar.
[Bengali](Bengal "wikilink") silk was a major item of international
trade for centuries. It was known as Ganges silk in medieval Europe.
Bengal was the leading exporter of silk between the 16th and 19th
centuries.[35]

### Ancient Mediterranean

![](Gunthertuch.jpg "fig:Gunthertuch.jpg")*, an 11th-century silk
celebrating a [Byzantine emperor](Byzantine_emperor "wikilink")'s
triumph\]\] In the*[Odyssey](Odyssey "wikilink")*, 19.233, when
Odysseus, while pretending to be someone else, is questioned by Penelope
about her husband's clothing, he says that he wore a shirt "gleaming
like the skin of a dried onion" (varies with translations, literal
translation here)[36] which could refer to the lustrous quality of silk
fabric. [Aristotle](Aristotle "wikilink") wrote of*[Coa
vestis](Coa_vestis "wikilink")'', a wild silk textile from
[Kos](Kos "wikilink"). [Sea silk](Sea_silk "wikilink") from certain
large sea shells was also valued. The [Roman
Empire](Roman_Empire "wikilink") knew of and traded in silk, and Chinese
silk was the most highly priced luxury good imported by them.[37] During
the reign of emperor [Tiberius](Tiberius "wikilink"), [sumptuary
laws](sumptuary_laws "wikilink") were passed that forbade men from
wearing silk garments, but these proved ineffectual.[38] The [Historia
Augusta](Historia_Augusta "wikilink") mentions that the third-century
emperor [Elagabalus](Elagabalus "wikilink") was the first Roman to wear
garments of pure silk, whereas it had been customary to wear fabrics of
silk/cotton or silk/linen blends.[39] Despite the popularity of silk,
the secret of silk-making only reached Europe around AD 550, via the
[Byzantine Empire](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink"). Legend has it that
monks working for the emperor [Justinian I](Justinian_I "wikilink")
[smuggled silkworm
eggs](Smuggling_of_silkworm_eggs_into_the_Byzantine_Empire "wikilink")
to [Constantinople](Constantinople "wikilink") in hollow canes from
China. All top-quality looms and weavers were located inside the [Great
Palace complex](Great_Palace_of_Constantinople "wikilink") in
Constantinople, and the cloth produced was used in imperial robes or in
diplomacy, as gifts to foreign dignitaries. The remainder was sold at
very high prices.

### Middle East

In the [Torah](Torah "wikilink"), a scarlet cloth item called in Hebrew
"sheni tola'at" שני תולעת – literally "crimson of the worm" – is
described as being used in purification ceremonies, such as those
following a leprosy outbreak (Leviticus 14), alongside
[cedar](Cedar_wood "wikilink") wood and [hyssop](hyssop "wikilink")
([za'atar](za'atar "wikilink")). Eminent scholar and leading medieval
translator of [Jewish](Jewish "wikilink") sources and books of the
[Bible](Bible "wikilink") into [Arabic](Arabic "wikilink"), Rabbi
[Saadia Gaon](Saadia_Gaon "wikilink"), translates this phrase explicitly
as "crimson silk" – חריר קרמז حرير قرمز.

In [Islamic](Islamic "wikilink") teachings, Muslim men are forbidden to
wear silk. Many religious jurists believe the reasoning behind the
prohibition lies in avoiding clothing for men that can be considered
feminine or extravagant.[40] There are disputes regarding the amount of
silk a fabric can consist of (e.g., whether a small decorative silk
piece on a cotton caftan is permissible or not) for it to be lawful for
men to wear, but the dominant opinion of most Muslim scholars is that
the wearing of silk by men is forbidden. Modern attire has raised a
number of issues, including, for instance, the permissibility of wearing
silk [neckties](necktie "wikilink"), which are masculine articles of
clothing.

Despite injunctions against silk for men, silk has retained its
popularity in the [Islamic world](Muslim_world "wikilink") because of
its permissibility for women, and due to the presence of non-Muslim
communities. The Muslim [Moors](Moors "wikilink") brought silk with them
to Spain during their conquest of the [Iberian
Peninsula](Iberian_Peninsula "wikilink").

### Medieval and modern Europe

![](Folding_Fan_with_Box_LACMA_M.78.108.6a-b_(2_of_2).jpg "Folding_Fan_with_Box_LACMA_M.78.108.6a-b_(2_of_2).jpg")

Italy was the most important producer of silk during the Medieval age.
The first center to introduce silk production to Italy was the city of
[Catanzaro](Catanzaro "wikilink") during the 11th century in the region
of [Calabria](Calabria "wikilink"). The silk of Catanzaro supplied
almost all of Europe and was sold in a large market fair in the port of
[Reggio Calabria](Reggio_Calabria "wikilink"), to Spanish, Venetian,
Genovese and Dutch merchants. Catanzaro became the lace capital of the
world with a large silkworm breeding facility that produced all the
laces and linens used in the Vatican. The city was world-famous for its
fine fabrication of silks, velvets, damasks and brocades.[41]

Another notable center was the Italian
[city-state](city-state "wikilink") of
[Lucca](Republic_of_Lucca "wikilink") which largely financed itself
through silk-production and silk-trading, beginning in the 12th century.
Other Italian cities involved in silk production were
[Genoa](Genoa "wikilink"), [Venice](Venice "wikilink") and
[Florence](Florence "wikilink").

The [Silk Exchange in Valencia](Llotja_de_la_Seda "wikilink") from the
15th century—where previously in 1348 also *perxal*
([percale](percale "wikilink")) was traded as some kind of
silk—illustrates the power and wealth of one of the great Mediterranean
mercantile cities.[42][43]

Silk was produced in and exported from the province of
[Granada](Granada "wikilink"), Spain, especially the
[Alpujarras](Alpujarras "wikilink") region, until the
[Moriscos](Morisco_rebellions_in_Granada "wikilink"), whose industry it
was, were expelled from Granada in 1571.[44][45]

Since the 15th century, silk production in France has been centered
around the city of [Lyon](Lyon,_France "wikilink") where many mechanic
tools for mass production were first introduced in the 17th century.
![](Anoniem_-_La_charmante_rencontre.JPG "fig:Anoniem_-_La_charmante_rencontre.JPG")
[James I](James_I_of_England "wikilink") attempted to establish silk
production in England, purchasing and planting 100,000 mulberry trees,
some on land adjacent to [Hampton Court
Palace](Hampton_Court_Palace "wikilink"), but they were of a species
unsuited to the silk worms, and the attempt failed. In 1732 John
Guardivaglio set up a silk throwing enterprise at [Logwood mill in
Stockport](List_of_mills_in_Stockport "wikilink"); in 1744, Burton Mill
was erected in [Macclesfield](Macclesfield "wikilink"); and in 1753 Old
Mill was built in [Congleton](Congleton "wikilink").[46] These three
towns remained the centre of the English silk throwing industry until
silk throwing was replaced by [silk waste
spinning](silk_waste "wikilink"). British enterprise also established
silk filature in [Cyprus](Cyprus "wikilink") in 1928. In England in the
mid-20th century, raw silk was produced at [Lullingstone
Castle](Lullingstone_Castle "wikilink") in Kent. Silkworms were raised
and reeled under the direction of Zoe Lady Hart Dyke, later moving to
[Ayot St Lawrence](Ayot_St_Lawrence "wikilink") in Hertfordshire in
1956.[47]

### North America

Wild silk taken from the nests of native caterpillars was used by the
[Aztecs](Aztecs "wikilink") to make containers and as paper.[51][52]
Silkworms were introduced to [Oaxaca](Oaxaca_Valley "wikilink") from
Spain in the 1530s and the region profited from silk production until
the early 17th century, when the king of Spain banned export to protect
Spain's silk industry. Silk production for local consumption has
continued until the present day, sometimes spinning wild silk.[53]

King [James I](James_VI_and_I "wikilink") introduced silk-growing to the
British colonies in America around 1619, ostensibly to discourage
[tobacco](tobacco "wikilink") planting. The
[Shakers](Shakers "wikilink") in Kentucky adopted the practice.
![](Satin_mã_châu_2.jpg "fig:Satin_mã_châu_2.jpg")
![](Smithsonian_Holyoke_SkinnersSatins_Sample.jpg "fig:Smithsonian_Holyoke_SkinnersSatins_Sample.jpg"),
produced by [William Skinner &
Sons](William_Skinner_and_Sons "wikilink") of [Holyoke,
Massachusetts](Holyoke,_Massachusetts "wikilink"), the largest producer
of such textiles in the world in the early 20th century[54]\]\] The
history of industrial silk in the United States is largely tied to
several smaller urban centers in the Northeast region. Beginning in the
1830s, [Manchester, Connecticut](Manchester,_Connecticut "wikilink")
emerged as the early center of the silk industry in America, when the
Cheney Brothers became the first in the United States to properly raise
silkworms on an industrial scale; today the [Cheney Brothers Historic
District](Cheney_Brothers_Historic_District "wikilink") showcases their
former mills.[55] With the [mulberry tree](mulberry_tree "wikilink")
craze of that decade, other smaller producers began raising silkworms.
This economy particularly gained traction in the vicinity of
[Northampton, Massachusetts](Northampton,_Massachusetts "wikilink") and
its neighboring [Williamsburg](Williamsburg,_Massachusetts "wikilink"),
where a number of small firms and cooperatives emerged. Among the most
prominent of these was the cooperative utopian Northampton Association
for Education and Industry, of which [Sojourner
Truth](Sojourner_Truth "wikilink") was a member.[56] Following the
destructive [Mill River Flood of
1874](Mill_River_Flood_of_1874 "wikilink"), one manufacturer, [William
Skinner](William_Skinner_(manufacturer) "wikilink"), relocated his mill
from Williamsburg to the then-new city of [Holyoke](Holyoke "wikilink").
Over the next 50 years he and his sons would maintain relations between
the American silk industry and its counterparts in Japan,[57] and
expanded their business to the point that by 1911, the Skinner Mill
complex contained the largest silk mill under one roof in the world, and
the brand Skinner Fabrics had become the largest manufacturer of silk
satins internationally.[58][59] Other efforts later in the 19th century
would also bring the new silk industry to [Paterson, New
Jersey](Paterson,_New_Jersey "wikilink"), with several firms hiring
European-born textile workers and granting it the nickname "Silk City"
as another major center of production in the United States.

[World War II](World_War_II "wikilink") interrupted the silk trade from
Asia, and silk prices increased dramatically.[60] U.S. industry began to
look for substitutes, which led to the use of
[synthetics](Synthetic_fiber "wikilink") such as
[nylon](nylon "wikilink"). Synthetic silks have also been made from
[lyocell](lyocell "wikilink"), a type of
[cellulose](cellulose "wikilink") fiber, and are often difficult to
distinguish from real silk (see [spider silk](spider_silk "wikilink")
for more on synthetic silks).

### Malaysia

In [Terengganu](Terengganu "wikilink"), which is now part of
[Malaysia](Malaysia "wikilink"), a second generation of silkworm was
being imported as early as 1764 for the country's silk textile industry,
especially [songket](songket "wikilink").[61] However, since the 1980s,
Malaysia is no longer engaged in sericulture but does plant mulberry
trees.

### Vietnam

In Vietnamese legend, silk appeared in the first millennia AD and is
still being woven today.

## Production process

The process of silk production is known as
[sericulture](sericulture "wikilink").[62] The entire production process
of silk can be divided into several steps which are typically handled by
different entities . Extracting raw silk starts by cultivating the
silkworms on mulberry leaves. Once the worms start pupating in their
cocoons, these are dissolved in boiling water in order for individual
long fibres to be extracted and fed into the spinning reel.[63]

To produce 1 kg of silk, 104 kg of mulberry leaves must be eaten by 3000
silkworms. It takes about 5000 silkworms to make a pure silk

The environmental impact of silk production is potentially large when
compared with other natural fibers. A life cycle assessment of Indian
silk production shows that the production process has a large carbon and
water footprint, mainly due to the fact that it is an animal-derived
fiber and more inputs such as fertilizer and water are needed per unit
of fiber produced.[67]

## Properties

![](Models_by_David_Shankbone.jpg "Models_by_David_Shankbone.jpg")

### Physical properties

Silk fibers from the *Bombyx mori* silkworm have a
[triangular](triangle "wikilink") [cross
section](Cross_section_(geometry) "wikilink") with rounded corners, 5–10
[μm](μm "wikilink") wide. The fibroin-heavy chain is composed mostly of
[beta-sheets](beta-sheet "wikilink"), due to a 59-mer amino acid repeat
sequence with some variations.[68] The flat surfaces of the fibrils
reflect [light](light "wikilink") at many angles, giving silk a natural
sheen. The cross-section from other silkworms can vary in shape and
diameter: crescent-like for *Anaphe* and elongated wedge for *tussah*.
Silkworm fibers are naturally extruded from two silkworm glands as a
pair of primary filaments (brin), which are stuck together, with sericin
proteins that act like [glue](glue "wikilink"), to form a
[bave](bave "wikilink"). Bave diameters for tussah silk can reach 65 μm.
See cited reference for cross-sectional SEM photographs.[69]
![](Silk_raw_01a.jpg "fig:Silk_raw_01a.jpg") Silk has a smooth, soft
texture that is not slippery, unlike many [synthetic
fibers](synthetic_fiber "wikilink").

Silk is one of the strongest natural fibers, but it loses up to 20% of
its strength when wet. It has a good [moisture
regain](moisture_regain "wikilink") of 11%. Its
[elasticity](Elasticity_(physics) "wikilink") is moderate to poor: if
elongated even a small amount, it remains stretched. It can be weakened
if exposed to too much sunlight. It may also be attacked by insects,
especially if left dirty.

One example of the durable nature of silk over other fabrics is
demonstrated by the recovery in 1840 of silk garments from a [wreck of
1782](HMS_Royal_George_(1756) "wikilink"): 'The most durable article
found has been silk; for besides pieces of cloaks and lace, a pair of
black satin breeches, and a large satin waistcoat with flaps, were got
up, of which the silk was perfect, but the lining entirely gone ... from
the thread giving way ... No articles of dress of woollen cloth have yet
been found.'[70]

Silk is a poor conductor of [electricity](electricity "wikilink") and
thus susceptible to [static cling](static_cling "wikilink"). Silk has a
high emissivity for infrared light, making it feel cool to the
touch.[71]

Unwashed silk chiffon may [shrink](Shrinkage_(fabric) "wikilink") up to
8% due to a relaxation of the fiber macrostructure, so silk should
either be washed prior to garment construction, or [dry
cleaned](Dry_cleaning "wikilink"). Dry cleaning may still shrink the
chiffon up to 4%. Occasionally, this shrinkage can be reversed by a
gentle steaming with a press cloth. There is almost no gradual shrinkage
nor shrinkage due to molecular-level deformation.

Natural and synthetic silk is known to manifest
[piezoelectric](piezoelectricity "wikilink") properties in proteins,
probably due to its molecular structure.[72]

Silkworm silk was used as the standard for the
[denier](Denier_(measure) "wikilink"), a measurement of [linear
density](linear_density "wikilink") in fibers. Silkworm silk therefore
has a linear density of approximately 1 den, or 1.1
[dtex](dtex "wikilink").

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|------------------|

| [Spider](Spider "wikilink"): *[Argiope aurentia](Argiope_aurentia "wikilink")* | 0.14                  | 3.57          | 14.8%            |

### Chemical properties

Silk emitted by the silkworm consists of two main proteins,
[sericin](sericin "wikilink") and [fibroin](fibroin "wikilink"), fibroin
being the structural center of the silk, and serecin being the sticky
material surrounding it. Fibroin is made up of the [amino
acids](amino_acid "wikilink")
[Gly](Glycine "wikilink")-[Ser](Serine "wikilink")-Gly-[Ala](Alanine "wikilink")-Gly-Ala
and forms [beta pleated sheets](beta_sheet "wikilink"). [Hydrogen
bonds](Hydrogen_bond "wikilink") form between chains, and side chains
form above and below the plane of the hydrogen bond network.

The high proportion (50%) of glycine allows tight packing. This is
because glycine's R group is only a hydrogen and so is not as sterically
constrained. The addition of alanine and serine makes the fibres strong
and resistant to breaking. This tensile strength is due to the many
interceded hydrogen bonds, and when stretched the force is applied to
these numerous bonds and they do not break.

Silk is resistant to most [mineral acids](mineral_acid "wikilink"),
except for [sulfuric acid](sulfuric_acid "wikilink"), which dissolves
it. It is yellowed by perspiration. Chlorine bleach will also destroy
silk fabrics.

## Variants

### Regenerated silk fiber

RSF is produced by chemically dissolving silkworm cocoons, leaving their
molecular structure intact. The silk fibers dissolve into tiny
thread-like structures known as [microfibrils](microfibril "wikilink").
The resulting solution is extruded through a small opening, causing the
microfibrils to reassemble into a single fiber. The resulting material
is reportedly twice as stiff as silk.[74]

## Applications

![](Turkeye.Urgüp02.jpg "fig:Turkeye.Urgüp02.jpg"),
[Turkey](Turkey "wikilink"), 2007.\]\]

### Clothing

Silk's [absorbency](absorption_(chemistry) "wikilink") makes it
comfortable to wear in warm weather and while active. Its low
conductivity keeps warm air close to the skin during cold weather. It is
often used for clothing such as [shirts](shirt "wikilink"),
[ties](necktie "wikilink"), [blouses](blouse "wikilink"), formal
[dresses](dress "wikilink"), high fashion clothes,
[lining](lining_(sewing) "wikilink"), [lingerie](lingerie "wikilink"),
[pajamas](pajama "wikilink"), [robes](robe "wikilink"), dress
[suits](Formal_wear "wikilink"), sun dresses and Eastern [folk
costumes](folk_costume "wikilink"). For practical use, silk is excellent
as clothing that protects from many biting [insects](insects "wikilink")
that would ordinarily pierce clothing, such as
[mosquitoes](mosquitoes "wikilink") and
[horseflies](Horse-fly "wikilink").

Fabrics that are often made from silk include
[charmeuse](charmeuse "wikilink"), [habutai](habutai "wikilink"),
[chiffon](chiffon_(fabric) "wikilink"), [taffeta](taffeta "wikilink"),
[crepe de chine](crape "wikilink"), [dupioni](dupioni "wikilink"),
[noil](noil "wikilink"), [tussah](tussah "wikilink"), and
[shantung](shantung_(fabric) "wikilink"), among others.

### Furniture

Silk's attractive lustre and drape makes it suitable for many
[furnishing](furnishing "wikilink") applications. It is used for
[upholstery](upholstery "wikilink"), wall coverings, window treatments
(if blended with another fiber), [rugs](Carpet "wikilink"),
[bedding](bedding "wikilink") and wall hangings.

### Industry

Silk had many industrial and commercial uses, such as in
[parachutes](parachute "wikilink"), bicycle [tires](tire "wikilink"),
[comforter filling](silk_comforter "wikilink") and
[artillery](artillery "wikilink") [gunpowder](gunpowder "wikilink")
bags.[75]

### Medicine

A special manufacturing process removes the outer
[sericin](sericin "wikilink") coating of the silk, which makes it
suitable as non-absorbable [surgical
sutures](surgical_suture "wikilink"). This process has also recently led
to the introduction of specialist silk underclothing, which has been
used for skin conditions including [eczema](eczema "wikilink").[76][77]
New uses and manufacturing techniques have been found for silk for
making everything from disposable cups to drug delivery systems and
holograms.[78]

### Biomaterial

Silk has been considered as a luxurious textile since 3630 BC. However,
it started to serve also as a biomedical material for suture in
surgeries decades ago. In the past 30 years, it has been widely studied
and used as a biomaterial, which refers to materials used for medical
applications in organisms, due to its excellent properties, including
remarkable mechanical properties, comparative biocompatibility, tunable
degradation rates *in vitro* and *in vivo*, the ease to load cellular
growth factors (for example, BMP-2), and the ability to be processed
into several other formats such as films, gels, particles, and
scaffolds.[79] Silks from *Bombyx mori*, a kind of cultivated silkworm,
are the most widely investigated silks.[80]

Silks derived from *Bombyx mori* are generally made of two parts: the
[silk fibroin](silk_fibroin "wikilink") fiber which contains a light
chain of 25kDa and a heavy chain of 350kDa (or 390kDa[81]) linked by a
single disulfide bond[82] and a glue-like protein,
[sericin](sericin "wikilink"), comprising 25 to 30 percentage by weight.
Silk fibroin contains hydrophobic [beta sheet](beta_sheet "wikilink")
blocks, interrupted by small hydrophilic groups. And the beta-sheets
contribute much to the high mechanical strength of silk fibers, which
achieves 740 MPa, tens of times that of [poly(lactic
acid)](Polylactic_acid "wikilink") and hundreds of times that of
[collagen](collagen "wikilink"). This impressive mechanical strength has
made silk fibroin very competitive for applications in biomaterials.
Indeed, silk fibers have found their way into tendon tissue
engineering,[83] where mechanical properties matter greatly. In
addition, mechanical properties of silks from various kinds of silkworms
vary widely, which provides more choices for their use in tissue
engineering.

Most products fabricated from regenerated silk are weak and brittle,
with only ≈1–2% of the mechanical strength of native silk fibers due to
the absence of appropriate secondary and hierarchical structure,

#### Biocompatibility

Biocompatibility, i.e., to what level the silk will cause an immune
response, is a critical issue for biomaterials. The issue arose during
its increasing clinical use. Wax or silicone is usually used as a
coating to avoid fraying and potential immune responses[85] when silk
fibers serve as suture materials. Although the lack of detailed
characterization of silk fibers, such as the extent of the removal of
sericin, the surface chemical properties of coating material, and the
process used, make it difficult to determine the real immune response of
silk fibers in literature, it is generally believed that sericin is the
major cause of immune response. Thus, the removal of sericin is an
essential step to assure biocompatibility in biomaterial applications of
silk. However, further research fails to prove clearly the contribution
of sericin to inflammatory responses based on isolated sericin and
sericin based biomaterials.[86] In addition, silk fibroin exhibits an
inflammatory response similar to that of tissue culture plastic in
vitro[87][88] when assessed with human mesenchymal [stem
cell](stem_cell "wikilink")s (hMSCs) or lower than collagen and PLA when
implant rat MSCs with silk fibroin films in vivo.[89] Thus, appropriate
degumming and sterilization will assure the biocompatibility of silk
fibroin, which is further validated by in vivo experiments on rats and
pigs.[90] There are still concerns about the long-term safety of
silk-based biomaterials in the human body in contrast to these promising
results. Even though silk sutures serve well, they exist and interact
within a limited period depending on the recovery of wounds (several
weeks), much shorter than that in tissue engineering. Another concern
arises from biodegradation because the biocompatibility of silk fibroin
does not necessarily assure the biocompatibility of the decomposed
products. In fact, different levels of immune responses[91][92] and
diseases[93] have been triggered by the degraded products of silk
fibroin.

#### Biodegradability

Biodegradability (also known as
[biodegradation](biodegradation "wikilink"))--the ability to be
disintegrated by biological approaches, including bacteria, fungi, and
cells—is another significant property of biomaterials today.
Biodegradable materials can minimize the pain of patients from
surgeries, especially in tissue engineering, there is no need of surgery
in order to remove the scaffold implanted. Wang et al.[94] showed the in
vivo degradation of silk via aqueous 3-D scaffolds implanted into Lewis
rats. [Enzyme](Enzyme "wikilink")s are the means used to achieve
degradation of silk in vitro. Protease XIV from Streptomyces griseus and
α-chymotrypsin from bovine pancreases are the two popular enzymes for
silk degradation. In addition,
[gamma-radiation](Gamma_Radiation "wikilink"), as well as [cell
metabolism](cell_metabolism "wikilink"), can also regulate the
degradation of silk.

Compared with synthetic biomaterials such as
[polyglycolides](polyglycolide "wikilink") and
[polylactides](polylactide "wikilink"), silk is obviously advantageous
in some aspects in biodegradation. The acidic degraded products of
polyglycolides and polylactides will decrease the pH of the ambient
environment and thus adversely influence the metabolism of cells, which
is not an issue for silk. In addition, silk materials can retain
strength over a desired period from weeks to months as needed by
mediating the content of beta sheets.

#### Genetic modification

[Genetic modification](Genetic_modification "wikilink") of domesticated
silkworms has been used to alter the composition of the silk.[95] As
well as possibly facilitating the production of more useful types of
silk, this may allow other industrially or therapeutically useful
proteins to be made by silkworms.[96]

## Cultivation

![](Thai_man_spools_silk_at_Jim_Thompson_House_photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg "fig:Thai_man_spools_silk_at_Jim_Thompson_House_photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg")
![](Bombyx_mori_Cocon_02.jpg "fig:Bombyx_mori_Cocon_02.jpg")\]\] Silk
[moths](moth "wikilink") lay eggs on specially prepared paper. The eggs
hatch and the caterpillars (silkworms) are fed fresh
[mulberry](mulberry "wikilink") leaves. After about 35 days and 4
moltings, the caterpillars are 10,000 times heavier than when hatched
and are ready to begin spinning a cocoon. A straw frame is placed over
the tray of caterpillars, and each caterpillar begins spinning a cocoon
by moving its head in a pattern. Two glands produce liquid silk and
force it through openings in the head called spinnerets. Liquid silk is
coated in sericin, a water-soluble protective gum, and solidifies on
contact with the air. Within 2–3 days, the caterpillar spins about 1
mile of filament and is completely encased in a cocoon. The silk farmers
then heat the cocoons to kill them, leaving some to
[metamorphose](metamorphosis "wikilink") into moths to breed the next
generation of caterpillars. Harvested cocoons are then soaked in boiling
water to soften the sericin holding the silk fibers together in a cocoon
shape. The fibers are then unwound to produce a continuous thread. Since
a single thread is too fine and fragile for commercial use, anywhere
from three to ten strands are spun together to form a single thread of
silk.[97]

## Animal rights

As the process of harvesting the silk from the cocoon kills the larvae
by boiling them, sericulture has been criticized by animal welfare and
rights activists.[98] [Mohandas
Gandhi](Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi "wikilink") was critical of silk
production based on the [Ahimsa](Ahimsa "wikilink") philosophy, which
led to the promotion of cotton and [Ahimsa
silk](Ahimsa_silk "wikilink"), a type of [wild
silk](wild_silk "wikilink") made from the cocoons of wild and semi-wild
silk moths.[99]

Since silk cultivation kills silkworms, possibly painfully,[100] [People
for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals](People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals "wikilink") (PETA)
urges people not to buy silk items.[101]
