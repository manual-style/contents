**Sisal** (,[1] ), with the botanical name ***Agave sisalana***, is a
species of *[Agave](/Agave "wikilink")* native to southern Mexico but
widely cultivated and naturalized in many other countries. It yields a
stiff [fibre](/fiber "wikilink") used in making various products. The
term sisal may refer either to the plant's common name or the fibre,
depending on the context. It is sometimes referred to as "sisal hemp",
because for centuries [hemp](/hemp "wikilink") was a major source for
fibre, and other fibre sources were named after it.

The sisal fibre is traditionally used for [rope](/rope "wikilink") and
[twine](/twine "wikilink"), and has many other uses, including
[paper](/paper "wikilink"), [cloth](/cloth "wikilink"),
[footwear](/footwear "wikilink"), [hats](/hats "wikilink"),
[bags](/bag "wikilink"), [carpets](/carpet "wikilink"), and
[dartboards](/dartboard "wikilink").

## Taxonomy

The [native](/native_plant "wikilink") origin of *Agave sisalana* is
uncertain. Traditionally it was deemed to be a native of the [Yucatán
Peninsula](/Yucatan_Peninsula "wikilink"), but there are no records of
botanical collections from there. They were originally shipped from the
Spanish colonial port of [Sisal](/Sisal,_Yucatán "wikilink") in
[Yucatán](/Yucatán_(state) "wikilink") (thus the name). The Yucatán
[plantations](/plantation "wikilink") now cultivate [henequen (*Agave
fourcroydes*)](/Agave_fourcroydes "wikilink").

[H.S. Gentry](/Howard_Scott_Gentry "wikilink") hypothesized a
[Chiapas](/Chiapas "wikilink") origin, on the strength of traditional
local usage. Evidence of an indigenous [cottage
industry](/cottage_industry "wikilink") there suggests it as the
original habitat location, possibly as a cross of *[Agave
angustifolia](/Agave_angustifolia "wikilink")* and *[Agave
kewensis](/Agave_kewensis "wikilink")*. The species is now naturalized
in other parts of Mexico, as well as in [Spain](/Spain "wikilink"),
[Libya](/Libya "wikilink"), [Morocco](/Morocco "wikilink"), the [Canary
Islands](/Canary_Islands "wikilink"), [Cape
Verde](/Cape_Verde "wikilink"), many parts of
[Africa](/Africa "wikilink"), [Madagascar](/Madagascar "wikilink"),
[Réunion](/Réunion "wikilink"), [Seychelles](/Seychelles "wikilink"),
[China](/China "wikilink"), the [Ryukyu
Islands](/Ryukyu_Islands "wikilink"), [India](/India "wikilink"),

[Hawaii](/Hawaii "wikilink"), [Florida](/Florida "wikilink"), [Central
America](/Central_America "wikilink"), [Ecuador](/Ecuador "wikilink"),
and the [West Indies](/West_Indies "wikilink").[2]

### Plant description

Sisal plants, *Agave sisalana*, consist of a
[rosette](/Rosette_(botany) "wikilink") of sword-shaped leaves about
tall. Young leaves may have a few minute teeth along their margins, but
lose them as they mature.[3]

The sisal plant has a 7–10 year life-span and typically produces 200–250
commercially usable leaves. Each leaf contains an average of around 1000
fibres. The fibres account for only about 4% of the plant by weight.
Sisal is considered a plant of the tropics and subtropics, since
production benefits from temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius and
sunshine.[4]

## Cultivation

Sisal was used by the [Aztecs](/Aztecs "wikilink") and the
[Mayans](/Mayans "wikilink") to make crude fabrics and paper.[5]

In the 19th century, sisal cultivation spread to
[Florida](/Florida "wikilink"), the [Caribbean](/Caribbean "wikilink")
islands, and [Brazil](/Brazil "wikilink") (Paraiba and Bahia), as well
as to countries in [Africa](/Africa "wikilink"), notably
[Tanzania](/Tanzania "wikilink") and [Kenya](/Kenya "wikilink"), and
[Asia](/Asia "wikilink").

In [Cuba](/Cuba "wikilink") its cultivation was introduced in 1880, by
[Fernando Heydrich](/Fernando_Heydrich "wikilink") in
[Matanzas](/Matanzas "wikilink").[6]

The first commercial plantings in Brazil were made in the late 1930s and
the first sisal fibre exports from there were made in 1948. It was not
until the 1960s that Brazilian production accelerated and the first of
many spinning mills was established. Today Brazil is the major world
producer of sisal. There are both positive and negative environmental
impacts from sisal growing.

### Propagation

Propagation of sisal is generally by using bulbils produced from buds in
the flower stalk or by suckers growing around the base of the plant,
which are grown in nursery fields until large enough to be transplanted
to their final position. These methods offer no potential for genetic
improvement. [In vitro](/In_vitro "wikilink") multiplication of selected
genetic material using [meristematic tissue
culture](/Meristem "wikilink") (MST) offers considerable potential for
the development of improved genetic material.[7]

### Fibre extraction

Fibre is extracted by a process known as
[decortication](/Decorticator "wikilink"), where leaves are crushed,
beaten, and brushed away by a rotating wheel set with blunt knives, so
that only fibres remain. Alternatively, in [East
Africa](/East_Africa "wikilink"), where production is typically on large
estates, the leaves are transported to a central decortication plant,
where water is used to wash away the waste parts of the leaf.[8]

The fibre is then dried, brushed and baled for export. Proper drying is
important as fibre quality depends largely on moisture content.
Artificial drying has been found to result in generally better grades of
fibre than sun drying, but is not always feasible in the developing
countries where sisal is produced. In the drier climate of north-east
Brazil, sisal is mainly grown by smallholders and the fibre is extracted
by teams using portable *raspadors* which do not use water.[9]

Fibre is subsequently cleaned by brushing. Dry fibres are machine combed
and sorted into various grades, largely on the basis of the previous
in-field separation of leaves into size groups.[10]

### Environmental impacts

Sisal farming initially caused environmental degradation, because sisal
plantations replaced native forests, but is still considered less
damaging than many types of farming. No chemical fertilizers are used in
sisal production, and although herbicides are occasionally used, even
this impact may be eliminated, since most weeding is done by hand.[11]
The effluent from the decortication process causes serious pollution
when it is allowed to flow into watercourses.[12] In Tanzania there are
plans to use the waste as bio-fuel.[13]

Sisal is considered to be an invasive species in
[Hawaii](/Hawaii "wikilink") and [Florida](/Florida "wikilink").[14]

## Uses

Traditionally, sisal has been the leading material for agricultural
twine (binder twine and [baler twine](/baler_twine "wikilink")) because
of its strength, durability, ability to stretch, affinity for certain
dyestuffs, and resistance to deterioration in saltwater.[15] The
importance of this traditional use is diminishing with competition from
polypropylene and the development of other haymaking techniques, while
new higher-valued sisal products have been developed.[16]

Apart from ropes, twines, and general cordage, sisal is used in low-cost
and specialty paper, dartboards, buffing cloth, filters,
[geotextiles](/geotextiles "wikilink"), mattresses, carpets,
handicrafts, wire rope cores, and Macramé.[17] Sisal has been utilized
as an environmentally friendly strengthening agent to replace asbestos
and fibreglass in composite materials in various uses including the
automobile industry.[18] The lower-grade fibre is processed by the paper
industry because of its high content of cellulose and hemicelluloses.
The medium-grade fibre is used in the cordage industry for making ropes,
baler and binder twine. Ropes and twines are widely employed for marine,
agricultural, and general industrial use. The higher-grade fibre after
treatment is converted into yarns and used by the carpet industry.[19]

Other products developed from sisal fibre include spa products, cat
scratching posts, lumbar support belts, rugs, slippers, cloths, and disc
buffers. Sisal wall covering meets the abrasion and tearing resistance
standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials and of the
National Fire Protection Association.[20] [thumb\|Weaving a door mat in
[Uganda](Uganda "wikilink")](/File:Sisal_mat.jpg "wikilink") As
extraction of fibre uses only a small percentage of the plant, some
attempts to improve economic viability have focused on utilizing the
waste material for production of [biogas](/biogas "wikilink"), for
stockfeed, or the extraction of pharmaceutical materials.

Sisal is a valuable forage for honey bees because of its long flowering
period. It is particularly attractive to them during pollen shortage.
The honey produced is however dark and has a strong and unpleasant
flavour.[21]

Because sisal is an agave, it can be distilled to make a
[tequila](/tequila "wikilink")-like liquor.[22]

Carpets

Despite the yarn durability sisal is known for, slight matting of sisal
carpeting may occur in high-traffic areas.[23] Sisal carpet does not
build up static nor does it trap dust, so vacuuming is the only
maintenance required. High-spill areas should be treated with a fibre
sealer and for spot removal, a drycleaning powder is recommended.
Depending on climatic conditions, sisal will absorb air humidity or
release it, causing expansion or contraction. Sisal is not recommended
for areas that receive wet spills or rain or snow.[24] Sisal is used by
itself in carpets or in blends with wool and acrylic for a softer
hand.[25]

Global production of sisal fibre in 2013 amounted to 281 thousand tonnes
of which [Brazil](/Brazil "wikilink"), the largest producing country,
produced 150,584 tonnes.[26]

[Tanzania](/Sisal_production_in_Tanzania "wikilink") produced
approximately 34,875 tons, [Kenya](/Kenya "wikilink") produced 28,000
tonnes, [Madagascar](/Madagascar "wikilink") 18,950 tonnes and 16,500
tonnes were produced in [China](/China "wikilink") (mainland).
[Venezuela](/Venezuela "wikilink") contributed 4,826 tons with smaller
amounts coming from [Morocco](/Morocco "wikilink"), [South
Africa](/South_Africa "wikilink"), [Mozambique](/Mozambique "wikilink"),
and [Angola](/Angola "wikilink"). Sisal occupies 6th place among fibre
plants, representing 2% of the world’s production of plant fibres (plant
fibres provide 65% of the world’s fibres).[27]

As one of the world's important natural fibres, sisal was included in
the scope of the [International Year of Natural
Fibres](/International_Year_of_Natural_Fibres "wikilink"), 2009.

## Heraldry

The sisal plant appears in the arms of
[Barquisimeto](/Barquisimeto "wikilink"), Venezuela.[28]

The [Yucatán State in Mexico](/Yucatán "wikilink") features a deer
bounding over a sisal plant on its [coat of
