**Spandex**, **Lycra** or **elastane** is a [synthetic
fiber](synthetic_fiber "wikilink") known for its exceptional
[elasticity](elasticity_(physics) "wikilink"). It is a
[polyether](polyether "wikilink")-[polyurea](polyurea "wikilink")
[copolymer](copolymer "wikilink") that was invented in 1958 by chemist
[Joseph Shivers](Joseph_Shivers "wikilink") at
[DuPont](DuPont "wikilink")'s Benger Laboratory in [Waynesboro,
Virginia](Waynesboro,_Virginia "wikilink").[1][2][3][4][5]

The name "spandex" is an [anagram](anagram "wikilink") of the word
"expands".[6] It is the preferred name in [North
America](North_America "wikilink"); in continental Europe it is referred
to by variants of "elastane", i.e. (France), (Germany, Sweden), (Spain),
(Italy) and (Netherlands), and is known in the UK, Ireland, Portugal,
Spain, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and Israel primarily as
Lycra. Brand names for spandex include Lycra (made by Koch subsidiary
[Invista](Invista "wikilink"), previously part of DuPont), **Elaspan**
(also Invista), **Acepora** (Taekwang), **Creora**
([Hyosung](Hyosung "wikilink")), **INVIYA** ([Indorama
Corporation](Indorama_Corporation "wikilink")), **ROICA** and
**Dorlastan** ([Asahi Kasei](Asahi_Kasei "wikilink")), **Linel**
(Fillattice), and **ESPA** ([Toyobo](Toyobo "wikilink")).

## Invention

[Dupont](DuPont "wikilink") textiles scientist Joseph C. Shivers was
determined to find a fiber to replace rubber in garments. He made a
breakthrough in the early 1950s when he used an intermediate substance
to modify [Dacron](Dacron "wikilink") polyester.[7] This modification
produced a stretchy fiber that could withstand high temperatures. After
nearly a decade of research the fiber was perfected in 1959. Originally
called Fiber K, DuPont chose the trade name Lycra to distinguish its
brand of spandex fiber.[8]

## Production

Spandex fibers are produced in four ways: melt extrusion, reaction
spinning, solution dry spinning, and solution wet spinning. All of these
methods include the initial step of reacting
[monomers](monomer "wikilink") to produce a prepolymer. Once the
prepolymer is formed, it is reacted further in various ways and drawn
out to make the fibers.

The solution dry spinning method is used to produce over 94.5% of the
world's spandex fibers,[9] and the process has five steps:

-   1\. The first step is to produce the prepolymer. This is done by
    mixing a macro[glycol](glycol "wikilink") with a
    [diisocyanate](diisocyanate "wikilink") monomer. The two compounds
    are mixed in a reaction vessel to produce a prepolymer. A typical
    ratio of glycol to diisocyanate is 1:2.[10]
-   2\. The prepolymer is further reacted with an equal amount of
    [diamine](diamine "wikilink"). This reaction is known as *[chain
    extension reaction](Chain-growth_polymerization "wikilink").* The
    resulting solution is diluted with a solvent
    ([DMAc](DMAc "wikilink")) to produce the spinning solution. The
    solvent helps make the solution thinner and more easily handled, and
    then it can be pumped into the fiber production cell.
-   3\. The spinning solution is pumped into a cylindrical spinning cell
    where it is cured and converted into fibers. In this cell, the
    [polymer solution](polymer_solution "wikilink") is forced through a
    metal plate called a [spinneret](Spinneret_(polymers) "wikilink").
    This causes the solution to be aligned in strands of liquid polymer.
    As the strands pass through the cell, they are heated in the
    presence of a nitrogen and solvent gas. This process causes the
    liquid polymer to react chemically and form solid strands.[11]
-   4\. As the fibers exit the cell, an amount of solid strands are
    bundled together to produce the desired thickness. Each fiber of
    spandex is made up of many smaller individual fibers that adhere to
    one another because of the natural stickiness of their surface.[12]
-   5\. The resulting fibers are then treated with a finishing agent
    which can be [magnesium stearate](magnesium_stearate "wikilink") or
    a polymer. This treatment prevents the fibers' sticking together and
    aids in textile manufacture. The fibers are then transferred through
    a series of rollers onto a spool.

## Role in fashion

In the post World War II era, DuPont Textiles Fibers Department, which
was formed in 1952, became its most popular division, dominating the
synthetic fiber market worldwide.[13] At this time, women began to
emerge as a significant group of consumers because of their need for
underwear and hosiery.[14] DuPont conducted market research to find out
what women wanted from textiles, then began developing fibers to meet
their needs. The "need" was a better fiber solution for women's
[girdles](Girdle_(undergarment) "wikilink"), which were commonly made of
rubber at the time. DuPont became interested in developing a synthetic
elastic fiber in the 1930s, which was perfected by chemist Joseph
Shivers in 1959. Spandex's transformative nature allowed it to be
incorporated into other garments besides girdles and undergarments.
DuPont launched an extensive publicity campaign for its Lycra brand,
taking advertisements and full-page ads in top women's magazines such as
*[Vogue](Vogue_(magazine) "wikilink")*,
*[Glamour](Glamour_(magazine) "wikilink"), [Harper
Bazaar](Harper's_Bazaar "wikilink"), Mademoiselle,
[McCalls](McCall's "wikilink"), [Ladies Home
Journal](Ladies'_Home_Journal "wikilink"), and [Good
Housekeeping](Good_Housekeeping "wikilink").*[15] Fashion's original
style icon, [Audrey Hepburn](Audrey_Hepburn "wikilink") helped catapult
the brand on and off-screen in the late 50's; models and actress like
[Joan Collins](Joan_Collins "wikilink") and
[Anne-Margret](Ann-Margret "wikilink") followed Hepburns aesthetic by
posing in Lycra clothing for photo shoots and magazine covers.[16]

By the mid-1970s, girdle sales began to drop with the emergence of the
[Women's Liberation Movement](Women's_liberation_movement "wikilink").
Girdles came to be associated with anti-independence and emblematic of
an era that was quickly passing away.[17] DuPont was not ready to
abandon a market that they were significantly reliant on. In response,
DuPont reimagined Lycra as the aerobic fitness movement emerged in the
1970s.[18] This expansion furthered at the [1968 Winter Olympic
Games](1968_Winter_Olympics "wikilink") when the French ski team wore
Lycra garments to compete.[19] This popularized the brand as essential
athletic wear because of its flexible and lightweight material. The
fiber proved to be especially popular in [mid-thigh-length
shorts](Cycling_shorts "wikilink") worn by cyclists.[20] By the 1980s,
the fitness trend had reached its height in popularity and fashionistas
began wearing shorts on the street.[21] Spandex proved such a popular
fiber in the garment industry that by 1987 DuPont had trouble meeting
worldwide demand. In the 1990s a variety of other items made with
Spandex proved popular, including a successful line of body-shaping
foundation garments sold under the trade name Bodyslimmers. As the
decade progressed, shirts, pants, dresses, and even shoes were being
made with spandex blends, and mass-market retailers like [Banana
Republic](Banana_Republic "wikilink") were using it for menswear.[22]

## Major spandex fiber uses

The elasticity and strength (stretching up to five times its length), of
spandex has been incorporated into a wide range of garments, especially
in [skin-tight garments](Skin-tight_garment "wikilink"). A benefit of
spandex is its significant strength and elasticity and its ability to
return to the original shape after stretching and faster drying than
ordinary fabrics. For clothing, spandex is usually mixed with
[cotton](cotton "wikilink") or [polyester](polyester "wikilink"), and
accounts for a small percentage of the final fabric, which therefore
retains most of the look and feel of the other fibers. In [North
America](North_America "wikilink") it is rare in men's clothing, but
prevalent in women's. An estimated 80% of clothing sold in the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") contained spandex in
2010.[23]![](Otago_Dancers_human_pyramid_2.jpg "fig:Otago_Dancers_human_pyramid_2.jpg")

## Harmful environmental impact

Today most clothes containing spandex end up as non-recyclable waste
once they have been worn out, as fabric blends containing spandex are
difficult to recycle. [24] This contributes to the pollution of the
environment.

When clothes are washed, hundreds of thousands of microfibres are
released into the wastewater, ending up in the oceans, and if clothes
contain plastic then they will cause
[microplastic](microplastic "wikilink") pollution.[25]
