**Spider silk** is a [protein](protein "wikilink")
[fibre](fibre "wikilink") spun by [spiders](spider "wikilink"). Spiders
use their [silk](silk "wikilink") to make [webs](Spider_web "wikilink")
or other structures, which function as sticky nets to catch other
animals, or as nests or cocoons to protect their offspring, or to wrap
up prey. They can also use their silk to suspend themselves, to float
through the air, or to glide away from predators. Most spiders vary the
thickness and stickiness of their silk for different uses.

In some cases, spiders may even use silk as a source of food.[1] While
methods have been developed to collect silk from a spider by force,[2]
it is difficult to gather silk from many spiders in a small space, in
contrast to [silkworm](Sericulture "wikilink") "farms".

## Biodiversity

### Uses

All spiders produce silks, and a single spider can produce up to seven
different types of silk for different uses.[3] This is in contrast to
insect silks, where an individual usually only produces one type of
silk.[4] Spider silks may be used in many different ecological ways,
each with properties to match the silk's function. As spiders have
evolved, so has their silks' complexity and diverse uses, for example
from primitive tube webs 300–400 million years ago to complex orb webs
110 million years ago.[5]

Some daily weavers of temporary webs also eat their own unused silk daily, thus mitigating a heavy metabolic expense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [12][13]  |
| Nest lining and nest construction | Tube webs used by "primitive" spiders such as the European tube web spider (*[Segestria florentina](Segestria_florentina "wikilink")*). Threads radiate out of nest to provide a sensory link to the outside. Silk is a component of the lids of spiders that use "trapdoors", such as members of the family [Ctenizidae](Ctenizidae "wikilink"), and the "water" or "diving bell" spider *[Argyroneta aquatica](Argyroneta_aquatica "wikilink")* builds its diving bell of silk. | [14]      |

| Drop lines and anchor lines       | Many spiders, such as the [Salticidae](Salticidae "wikilink"), that venture from shelter and leave a trail of silk, use that as an emergency line in case of falling from inverted or vertical surfaces. Many others, even web dwellers, will deliberately drop from a web when alarmed, using a silken thread as a drop line by which they can return in due course. Some, such as species of *Paramystaria*, also will hang from a drop line when feeding.                      | [16]      |
| Alarm lines                       | Some spiders that do not spin actual trap webs do lay out alarm webs that the feet of their prey (such as ants) can disturb, cueing the spider to rush out and secure the meal if it is small enough, or to avoid contact if the intruder seems too formidable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [17]      |
| Pheromonal trails                 | Some wandering spiders will leave a largely continuous trail of silk impregnated with pheromones that the opposite sex can follow to find a mate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [18]      |

### Types

Meeting the specification for all these ecological uses requires
different types of silk suited to different broad properties, as either
a fibre, a structure of fibres, or a silk-globule. These types include
glues and fibres. Some types of fibres are used for structural support,
others for constructing protective structures. Some can absorb energy
effectively, whereas others transmit vibration efficiently. In a spider,
these silk types are produced in different glands; so the silk from a
particular gland can be linked to its use by the spider.

| Gland             | Silk Use                                                                                          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ampullate (major) | Dragline silk—used for the web's outer rim and spokes, also for the lifeline and for ballooning.  |
| Ampullate (minor) | Used for temporary scaffolding during web construction.                                           |
| Flagelliform      | Capture-spiral silk—used for the capturing lines of the web.                                      |
| Tubuliform        | Egg cocoon silk—used for protective egg sacs.                                                     |
| Aciniform         | Used to wrap and secure freshly captured prey; used in the male sperm webs; used in stabilimenta. |
| Aggregate         | A silk glue of sticky globules.                                                                   |
| Piriform          | Used to form bonds between separate threads for attachment points.                                |

## Properties

### Mechanical properties

Each spider and each type of silk has a set of mechanical properties
optimised for their biological function.

Most silks, in particular dragline silk, have exceptional mechanical
properties. They exhibit a unique combination of high [tensile
strength](tensile_strength "wikilink") and extensibility
([ductility](ductility "wikilink")). This enables a silk fibre to absorb
a large amount of energy before breaking
([toughness](toughness "wikilink"), the [area
under](Integral "wikilink") a stress-strain curve).

![](Wikipedia_Kevlar_Silk_Comparison.jpg "fig:Wikipedia_Kevlar_Silk_Comparison.jpg")
A frequent mistake made in the mainstream media is to confuse strength
and toughness, when comparing silk to other materials. Weight for
weight, silk is stronger than steel, but not as strong as
[Kevlar](Kevlar "wikilink"). Silk is, however, tougher than either.

The variability of mechanical properties of spider silk fibres may be
important and it is related to their degree of molecular alignment.[19]
Mechanical properties depend strongly on the ambient conditions, i.e.
humidity and temperature.[20]

#### Strength

A dragline silk's [tensile strength](tensile_strength "wikilink") is
comparable to that of high-grade alloy [steel](steel "wikilink")
(450−2000 MPa),[21][22] and about half as strong as
[aramid](aramid "wikilink") filaments, such as
[Twaron](Twaron "wikilink") or Kevlar (3000 MPa).[23]

#### Density

Consisting of mainly protein, silks are about a sixth of the density of
steel (1.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). As a result, a strand long enough to
circle the Earth would weigh less than . (Spider dragline silk has a
tensile strength of roughly 1.3 [GPa](Pascal_(unit) "wikilink"). The
tensile strength listed for steel might be slightly higher—e.g.
1.65 GPa,[24][25] but spider silk is a much less dense material, so that
a given weight of spider silk is five times as strong as the same weight
of steel.)

##### Energy density

The [energy density](energy_density "wikilink") of dragline spider silk
is roughly .[26]

#### Extensibility

Silks are also extremely [ductile](ductile "wikilink"), with some able
to stretch up to five times their relaxed length without breaking.

#### Toughness

The combination of strength and ductility gives dragline silks a very
high [toughness](toughness "wikilink") (or work to fracture), which
"equals that of commercial [polyaramid](polyaramid "wikilink")
([aromatic nylon](aromatic_nylon "wikilink")) filaments, which
themselves are benchmarks of modern polymer fibre technology".[27][28]

#### Temperature

While unlikely to be relevant in nature, dragline silks can hold their
strength below −40 °C (−40 °F) and up to 220 °C (428 °F).[29] As occurs
in many materials, spider silk fibres undergo a [glass
transition](glass_transition "wikilink"). The glass-transition
temperature depends on the humidity, as water is a
[plasticiser](plasticiser "wikilink") for the silk.[30]

#### Supercontraction

When exposed to water, dragline silks undergo supercontraction,
shrinking up to 50% in length and behaving like a weak rubber under
tension.[31] Many hypotheses have been suggested as to its use in
nature, with the most popular being to automatically tension webs built
in the night using the morning dew.

#### Highest-performance

The toughest known spider silk is produced by the species [Darwin's bark
spider](Darwin's_bark_spider "wikilink") (*Caerostris darwini*): "The
toughness of forcibly silked fibers averages 350
[MJ/m<sup>3</sup>](Toughness#Unit_of_toughness "wikilink"), with some
samples reaching 520 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>. Thus, *C. darwini* silk is more
than twice as tough as any previously described silk, and over 10 times
tougher than Kevlar".[32]

### Adhesive properties

Silk fibre is a two-compound [pyriform](wikt:pyriform "wikilink")
secretion, spun into patterns (called "attachment discs") that are
employed to adhere silk threads to various surfaces using a minimum of
silk substrate.[33] The pyriform threads
[polymerise](polymer "wikilink") under ambient conditions, become
functional immediately, and are usable indefinitely, remaining
biodegradable, versatile and compatible with numerous other materials in
the environment.[34] The adhesive and durability properties of the
attachment disc are controlled by functions within the spinnerets.[35]
Some adhesive properties of the silk resemble [glue](glue "wikilink"),
consisting of [microfibrils](microfibrils "wikilink") and
[lipid](lipid "wikilink") enclosures.[36]

### Types of silk

Many species of spider have different
[glands](spinneret_(spider) "wikilink") to produce silk with different
properties for different purposes, including housing,
[web](spider_web "wikilink") construction, defence, capturing and
detaining [prey](prey "wikilink"), egg protection, and mobility (fine
"gossamer" thread for [ballooning](Ballooning_(spider) "wikilink"), or
for a strand allowing the spider to drop down as silk is extruded).
Different specialised silks have evolved with properties suitable for
different uses. For example, *[Argiope
argentata](Argiope_argentata "wikilink")* has five different types of
silk, each used for a different purpose:[37][38]

| Silk                                  | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| major-ampullate (dragline) silk       | Used for the web's outer rim and spokes and also for the lifeline.

| capture-spiral (flagelliform) silk    | Used for the capturing lines of the web. Sticky, extremely stretchy and tough. The capture spiral is sticky due to droplets of aggregate (a spider glue) that is placed on the spiral. The elasticity of flagelliform allows for enough time for the aggregate to adhere to the aerial prey flying into the web. |
| tubiliform (a.k.a. cylindriform) silk | Used for protective egg sacs. Stiffest silk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| aciniform silk                        | Used to wrap and secure freshly captured prey. Two to three times as tough as the other silks, including dragline.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Structural

### Macroscopic structure down to protein hierarchy

![](Structure_of_spider_silk_thread_Modified.svg "Structure_of_spider_silk_thread_Modified.svg")

Silks, like many other biomaterials, have a hierarchical structure. The
[primary structure](primary_structure "wikilink") is the [amino
acid](amino_acid "wikilink") sequence of its proteins
([spidroin](spidroin "wikilink")), mainly consisting of highly
repetitive glycine and alanine blocks,[39][40] which is why silks are
often referred to as a block co-polymer. On a secondary structure level,
the short side chained alanine is mainly found in the crystalline
domains ([beta sheets](beta_sheet "wikilink")) of the nanofibril,
glycine is mostly found in the so-called amorphous matrix consisting of
helical and beta turn structures.[41][42] It is the interplay between
the hard crystalline segments, and the strained elastic semi-amorphous
regions, that gives spider silk its extraordinary properties.[43][44]
Various compounds other than protein are used to enhance the fibre's
properties. [Pyrrolidine](Pyrrolidine "wikilink") has hygroscopic
properties which keeps the silk moist while also warding off ant
invasion. It occurs in especially high concentration in glue threads.
[Potassium](Potassium "wikilink") [hydrogen
phosphate](hydrogen_phosphate "wikilink") releases [hydrogen
ions](Hydron_(chemistry) "wikilink") in aqueous solution, resulting in a
[pH](pH "wikilink") of about 4, making the silk
[acidic](acid "wikilink") and thus protecting it from
[fungi](fungi "wikilink") and [bacteria](bacteria "wikilink") that would
otherwise digest the protein. [Potassium
nitrate](Potassium_nitrate "wikilink") is believed to prevent the
protein from denaturing in the acidic milieu.[45]

This first very basic model of silk was introduced by Termonia in
1994[46] who suggested crystallites embedded in an amorphous matrix
interlinked with hydrogen bonds. This model has refined over the years:
semi-crystalline regions were found[47] as well as a fibrillar skin core
model suggested for spider silk,[48] later visualised by
[AFM](Atomic_Force_Microscopy "wikilink") and
[TEM](Transmission_Electron_Microscopy "wikilink").[49] Sizes of the
nanofibrillar structure and the crystalline and semi-crystalline regions
were revealed by [neutron
scattering](neutron_scattering "wikilink").[50]

It has been possible to relate microstructural information and
macroscopic mechanical properties of the fibres.[51] The results show
that ordered regions (i) mainly reorient by deformation for
low-stretched fibres and (ii) the fraction of ordered regions increases
progressively for higher stretching of the fibres.



<File:0.Figure.png%7CSchematic> of the spider's orb web, structural
modules, and spider silk structure.[52] On the left is shown a schematic
drawing of an orb web. The red lines represent the dragline, radial
line, and frame lines, the blue lines represent the spiral line, and the
centre of the orb web is called the “hub”. Sticky balls drawn in blue
are made at equal intervals on the spiral line with viscous material
secreted from the aggregate gland. Attachment cement secreted from the
piriform gland is used to connect and fix different lines.
Microscopically, the spider silk secondary structure is formed of
spidroin and is said to have the structure shown on the right side. In
the dragline and radial line, a crystalline β-sheet and an amorphous
helical structure are interwoven. The large amount of β-spiral structure
gives elastic properties to the capture part of the orb web. In the
structural modules diagram, a microscopic structure of dragline and
radial lines is shown, composed mainly of two proteins of MaSp1 and
MaSp2, as shown in the upper central part. In the spiral line, there is
no crystalline β-sheet region.

### Non-protein composition

Various compounds other than protein are found in spider silks, such as
sugars, lipids, ions, and pigments that might affect the aggregation
behaviour and act as a protection layer in the final fibre.[53]

## Biosynthesis and fibre spinning

The production of silks, including spider silk, differs in an important
aspect from the production of most other fibrous biological materials:
rather than being continuously grown as keratin in hair, cellulose in
the cell walls of plants, or even the fibres formed from the compacted
faecal matter of beetles;[54] it is "spun" on demand from liquid silk
precursor out of specialised glands.[55]

The spinning process occurs when a fibre is pulled away from the body of
a spider, whether by the spider's legs, by the spider's falling under
its own weight, or by any other method including being pulled by humans.
The term "spinning" is misleading because no rotation of any component
occurs, but rather comes from analogy to the textile [spinning
wheels](spinning_wheel "wikilink"). Silk production is a
[pultrusion](pultrusion "wikilink"),[56] similar to extrusion, with the
subtlety that the force is induced by pulling at the finished fibre
rather than being squeezed out of a reservoir. The unspun silk fibre is
pulled through silk [glands](gland "wikilink") of which there may be
both numerous duplicates and different types of gland on any one spider
species.[57]

### Silk gland

![](SIA_spider_silk_Fig1.png "fig:SIA_spider_silk_Fig1.png") The gland's
visible, or external, part is termed the
[spinneret](spinneret_(spider) "wikilink"). Depending on the complexity
of the species, spiders will have two to eight spinnerets, usually in
pairs. There exist highly different specialised glands in different
spiders, ranging from simply a sac with an opening at one end, to the
complex, multiple-section major ampullate glands of the [golden silk
orb-weavers](golden_silk_orb-weaver "wikilink").[58]

Behind each spinneret visible on the surface of the spider lies a gland,
a generalised form of which is shown in the figure to the right,
"Schematic of a generalised gland".

![](Spider_silk_duct.svg "fig:Spider_silk_duct.svg"). Each differently
coloured section highlights a discrete section of the gland.[59][60]\]\]

Gland characteristics

1.  The first section of the gland labelled 1 on Figure 1 is the
    secretory or tail section of the gland. The walls of this section
    are lined with cells that secrete proteins Spidroin I and Spidroin
    II, the main components of this spider's dragline. These proteins
    are found in the form of droplets that gradually elongate to form
    long channels along the length of the final fibre, hypothesised to
    assist in preventing crack formation or even self-healing of the
    fibre.[61]
2.  The second section is the storage sac. This stores and maintains the
    gel-like unspun silk dope until it is required by the spider. In
    addition to storing the unspun silk gel, it secretes proteins that
    coat the surface of the final fibre.[62]
3.  The funnel rapidly reduces the large diameter of the storage sac to
    the small diameter of the tapering duct.
4.  The final length is the tapering duct, the site of most of the fibre
    formation. This consists of a tapering tube with several tight about
    turns, a valve almost at the end (mentioned in detail at point No. 5
    below) ending in a spigot from which the solid silk fibre emerges.
    The tube here tapers hyperbolically, therefore the unspun silk is
    under constant elongational shear stress, which is an important
    factor in fibre formation. This section of the duct is lined with
    cells that exchange ions, reduce the dope pH from neutral to acidic,
    and remove water from the fibre.[63] Collectively, the shear stress
    and the ion and pH changes induce the liquid silk dope to undergo a
    phase transition and condense into a solid protein fibre with high
    molecular organisation. The spigot at the end has lips that clamp
    around the fibre, controlling fibre diameter and further retaining
    water.
5.  Almost at the end of the tapering duct is a valve, approximate
    position marked "5" on figure 1. Though discovered some time ago,
    the precise purpose of this valve is still under discussion. It is
    believed to assist in restarting and rejoining broken fibres,[64]
    acting much in the way of a [helical pump](helical_pump "wikilink"),
    regulating the thickness of the fibre,[65] and/or clamping the fibre
    as a spider falls upon it.[66][67] There is some discussion of the
    similarity of the silk worm's silk press and the roles each of these
    valves play in the production of silk in these two organisms.

Throughout the process the unspun silk appears to have a nematic
texture,[68] in a similar manner to a [liquid
crystal](Liquid_crystal#Nematic_phase "wikilink"), arising in part due
to the extremely high protein concentration of silk dope (around 30% in
terms of weight per volume).[69] This allows the unspun silk to flow
through the duct as a liquid but maintain a molecular order.

As an example of a complex spinning field, the spinneret apparatus of an
adult *[Araneus diadematus](Araneus_diadematus "wikilink")* (garden
cross spider) consists of the glands shown below.[70] Similar multiple
gland architecture exists in the black widow spider.[71]

-   500 pyriform glands for attachment points
-   4 ampullate glands for the web frame
-   about 300 aciniform glands for the outer lining of egg sacs, and for
    ensnaring prey
-   4 tubuliform glands for egg sac silk
-   4 aggregate glands for adhesive functions
-   2 coronate glands for the thread of adhesion lines

## Artificial synthesis

![](Artificial_Spider_Silk_Strand.JPG "fig:Artificial_Spider_Silk_Strand.JPG")In
order to artificially synthesise spider silk into fibres, there are two
broad areas that must be covered. These are synthesis of the feedstock
(the unspun silk dope in spiders), and synthesis of the spinning
conditions (the funnel, valve, tapering duct, and spigot). There have
been a number of different approaches.

### Feedstock

The molecular structure of unspun silk is both complex and extremely
long. Though this endows the silk fibres with their desirable
properties, it also makes replication of the fibre somewhat of a
challenge. Various organisms have been used as a basis for attempts to
replicate some components or all of some or all of the proteins
involved. These proteins must then be extracted, purified and then spun
before their properties can be tested.

### Geometry

Spider silks with comparatively simple molecular structure need complex
ducts to be able to spin an effective fibre. There have been a number of
methods used to produce fibres, of which the main types are briefly
discussed below.

#### Syringe and needle

Feedstock is simply forced through a hollow needle using a syringe. This
method has been shown to make fibres successfully on multiple
occasions.[81][82]

Although very cheap and easy to assemble, the shape and conditions of
the gland are very loosely approximated. Fibres created using this
method may need encouragement to change from liquid to solid by removing
the water from the fibre with such chemicals as the environmentally
undesirable [methanol](methanol "wikilink")[83] or
[acetone](acetone "wikilink"),[84] and also may require post-stretching
of the fibre to attain fibres with desirable properties.[85][86]

#### Microfluidics

As the field of [microfluidics](microfluidics "wikilink") matures, it is
likely that more attempts to spin fibres will be made using
microfluidics. These have the advantage of being very controllable and
able to test spin very small volumes of unspun fibre[87][88] but setup
and development costs are likely to be high. A patent has been granted
in this area for spinning fibres in a method mimicking the process found
in nature, and fibres are successfully being continuously spun by a
commercial company.[89]

#### Electrospinning

[Electrospinning](Electrospinning "wikilink") is a very old technique
whereby a fluid is held in a container in a manner such that it is able
to flow out through capillary action. A conducting substrate is
positioned below, and a large difference in electrical potential is
applied between the fluid and the substrate. The fluid is attracted to
the substrate, and tiny fibres jump almost instantly from their point of
emission, the [Taylor cone](Taylor_cone "wikilink"), to the substrate,
drying as they travel. This method has been shown to create nano-scale
fibres from both silk dissected from organisms and [regenerated silk
fibroin](regenerated_silk_fibroin "wikilink").

### Other artificial shapes formed from silk

Silk can be formed into other shapes and sizes such as spherical
capsules for drug delivery, cell scaffolds and wound healing, textiles,
cosmetics, coatings, and many others.[90][91] Spider silk proteins can
also self-assemble on superhydrophobic surfaces to generate nanowires,
as well as micron-sized circular sheets.[92]

## Research milestones

Due to spider silk being a scientific research field with a long and
rich history, there can be unfortunate occurrences of researchers
independently rediscovering previously published findings. What follows
is a table of the discoveries made in each of the constituent areas,
acknowledged by the scientific community as being relevant and
significant by using the metric of scientific acceptance, citations.
Thus, only papers with 50 or more citations are included.

## Human uses

Peasants in the southern [Carpathian
Mountains](Carpathian_Mountains "wikilink") used to cut up tubes built
by *[Atypus](Atypus "wikilink")* and cover wounds with the inner lining.
It reportedly facilitated healing, and even connected with the skin.
This is believed to be due to antiseptic properties of spider silk[120]
and because the silk is rich in [vitamin K](vitamin_K "wikilink"), which
can be effective in clotting blood.[121] Due to the difficulties in
extracting and processing substantial amounts of spider silk, the
largest known piece of [cloth](cloth "wikilink") made of spider silk is
an textile with a [golden](Gold_(colour) "wikilink") tint made in
[Madagascar](Madagascar "wikilink") in 2009.[122] Eighty-two people
worked for four years to collect over one million [golden orb
spiders](golden_orb_spider "wikilink") and extract silk from them.[123]

The silk of *[Nephila clavipes](Nephila_clavipes "wikilink")* was used
in research concerning [mammalian](mammal "wikilink")
[neuronal](neuron "wikilink") regeneration.[124]

Spider silk has been used as a thread for
[crosshairs](crosshair "wikilink") in optical instruments such as
telescopes, microscopes,[125] and [telescopic rifle
sights](Telescopic_sight "wikilink").[126] In 2011, spider silk fibres
were used in the field of optics to generate very fine diffraction
patterns over [N-slit interferometric
signals](N-slit_interferometer "wikilink") used in optical
communications.[127] In 2012, spider silk fibres were used to create a
set of violin strings.[128]

Development of methods to [mass-produce](mass_production "wikilink")
spider silk has led to manufacturing of military, medical and consumer
goods, such as [ballistics](ballistics "wikilink")
[armour](armour "wikilink"), athletic footwear, [personal
care](personal_care "wikilink") products, [breast
implant](breast_implant "wikilink") and [catheter](catheter "wikilink")
coatings, mechanical [insulin](insulin "wikilink") pumps, fashion
clothing, and [outerwear](outerwear "wikilink").[129]

Spider silk is used to suspend [inertial confinement
fusion](inertial_confinement_fusion "wikilink") targets during laser
ignition, as it remains considerably elastic and has a high energy to
break at temperatures as low as 10-20K. In addition, it is made from
"light" atomic number elements that won't emit
[x-rays](x-ray "wikilink") during irradiation that could preheat the
target so that the pressure differential required for fusion is not
achieved.[130]

## Attempts at producing synthetic spider silk

Replicating the complex conditions required to produce fibres that are
comparable to spider silk has proven difficult in research and
early-stage manufacturing. Through [genetic
engineering](genetic_engineering "wikilink"), *Escherichia coli*
bacteria, yeasts, plants, silkworms, and animals have been used to
produce spider silk proteins, which have different, simpler
characteristics than those from a spider.[131] Artificial spider silks
have fewer and simpler proteins than natural dragline silk, and are
consequently half the diameter, strength, and flexibility of natural
dragline silk.[132]

-   One approach is to extract the spider silk [gene](gene "wikilink")
    and use other organisms to produce the spider silk. Working under
    the trademark [BioSteel](BioSteel "wikilink"), Canadian
    [biotechnology](biotechnology "wikilink") company Nexia successfully
    produced spider silk protein in [transgenic](transgenic "wikilink")
    [goats](goat "wikilink") that carried the gene for it; the milk
    produced by the goats contained significant quantities of the
    protein, 1–2 grams of silk proteins per litre of milk. Attempts to
    spin the protein into a fibre similar to natural spider silk
    resulted in fibres with tenacities of 2–3 grams per
    [denier](Denier_(measure) "wikilink").[133] Nexia used wet spinning
    and squeezed the silk protein solution through small extrusion holes
    in order to simulate the behavior of the spinneret, but this
    procedure was not sufficient to replicate the stronger properties of
    native spider silk.[134]
-   Extrusion of protein fibres in an aqueous environment is known as
    "wet-spinning". This process has so far produced silk fibres of
    diameters ranging from 10 to 60 μm, compared to diameters of
    2.5–4 μm for natural spider silk.
-   In March 2010, researchers from the [Korea Advanced Institute of
    Science &
    Technology](Korea_Advanced_Institute_of_Science_&_Technology "wikilink")
    succeeded in making spider silk directly using the bacteria *E.
    coli*, modified with certain genes of the spider [Nephila
    clavipes](Nephila_clavipes "wikilink"). This approach eliminates the
    need to milk spiders and allows the manufacture of the spider silk
    in a more cost-effective manner.[135]
-   The company [Kraig Biocraft
    Laboratories](Kraig_Biocraft_Laboratories "wikilink") used research
    from the Universities of [Wyoming](University_of_Wyoming "wikilink")
    and [Notre Dame](University_of_Notre_Dame "wikilink") to create
    silkworms that were genetically altered to produce spider
    silk.[136][137]
-   The company [AMSilk](AMSilk "wikilink") developed
    [spidroin](spidroin "wikilink") using bacteria, making it into an
    artificial spider silk.[138][139]
-   A 556 kDa spider silk protein was manufactured from 192 repeat
    motifs of the *Nephila clavipes* dragline spidroin, having similar
    mechanical characteristics as their natural counterparts, i.e.,
    [tensile strength](tensile_strength "wikilink") (1.03 ± 0.11 GPa),
    [modulus](Elastic_modulus "wikilink") (13.7 ± 3.0 GPa),
    extensibility (18 ± 6%), and toughness (114 ± 51 MJ/m3).[140]
-   Spiber has produced a synthetic spider silk that they are calling
    Q/QMONOS. In partnership with Goldwin, a ski parka made from this
    synthetic spider silk is currently in testing and is to be in mass
    production soon for less than $120,000 YEN.[141][142]
