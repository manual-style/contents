**Waffle fabric**, or sometimes **honeycomb fabric**, is usually made of
[cotton](/cotton "wikilink") or [microfibre](/microfibre "wikilink") and
is woven in a way which makes it very absorbent. The waffle weave also
allows air to flow through the fabric so that it dries quickly. Waffle
fabrics are made in a range of weights.

Waffle fabric is used for cleaning surfaces in industry. The surface of
the fabric is textured rather like a culinary
[waffle](/waffle "wikilink"), hence the name. This texture gives more
surface area for absorption and cleaning than a normal flat surface. It
is woven on a loom.
