**Wool** is the [textile](textile "wikilink") [fiber](fiber "wikilink")
obtained from [sheep](sheep "wikilink") and other animals, including
[cashmere](Cashmere_wool "wikilink") and [mohair](mohair "wikilink")
from [goats](cashmere_goat "wikilink"), [qiviut](qiviut "wikilink") from
[muskoxen](muskox "wikilink"), from [hide](Hide_(skin) "wikilink") and
[fur clothing](Fur_clothing "wikilink") from [bison](Bison "wikilink"),
[angora](Angora_wool "wikilink") from
[rabbits](Angora_rabbit "wikilink"), and other types of wool from
[camelids](camelid "wikilink");[1] additionally, the
[Highland](Highland_cattle "wikilink") and the
[Mangalica](Mangalica "wikilink") breeds of [cattle](cattle "wikilink")
and [swine](domestic_pig "wikilink"), respectively, possess woolly
coats.

Wool consists of protein together with a small percentage of lipids. In
this regard it is chemically quite distinct from the more dominant
textile, [cotton](cotton "wikilink"), which is mainly cellulose.[2]

## Characteristics

![](Hogget_fleece.JPG "fig:Hogget_fleece.JPG") fleece,
[Walcha](Walcha,_New_South_Wales "wikilink") Show\]\]Wool is produced by
[follicles](Hair_follicle "wikilink") which are small cells located in
the skin. These follicles are located in the upper layer of the skin
called the [epidermis](epidermis "wikilink") and push down into the
second skin layer called the [dermis](dermis "wikilink") as the wool
fibers grow. Follicles can be classed as either primary or secondary
follicles. Primary follicles produce three types of fiber:
[kemp](Kemp_(wool) "wikilink"), medullated fibers, and true wool fibers.
Secondary follicles only produce true wool fibers. Medullated fibers
share nearly identical characteristics to hair and are long but lack
crimp and elasticity. Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out.[3]
![](Wool_fleece_and_top.jpg "fig:Wool_fleece_and_top.jpg")
[Merino](Merino "wikilink") wool and combed wool top on a wool table\]\]
Wool's scaling and crimp make it easier to
[spin](spinning_(textiles) "wikilink") the fleece by helping the
individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together. Because
of the crimp, wool fabrics have greater bulk than other textiles, and
they hold air, which causes the fabric to retain heat. Wool has a high
[specific thermal resistance](specific_thermal_resistance "wikilink"),
so it impedes heat transfer in general. This effect has benefited desert
peoples, as [Bedouins](Bedouin "wikilink") and
[Tuaregs](Tuareg_people "wikilink") use wool clothes for insulation.

Felting of wool occurs upon hammering or other mechanical agitation as
the microscopic barbs on the surface of wool fibers hook together.

Wool has several qualities that distinguish it from hair/fur: it is
[crimped](crimp_(wool) "wikilink") and
[elastic](Elasticity_(physics) "wikilink").[4]

The amount of crimp corresponds to the fineness of the wool fibers. A
fine wool like [Merino](Merino "wikilink") may have up to 100 crimps per
inch, while coarser wool like [karakul](karakul_(sheep) "wikilink") may
have as few as one or two. In contrast, hair has little if any
[scale](Cuticle_(hair) "wikilink") and no crimp, and little ability to
bind into [yarn](yarn "wikilink"). On sheep, the hair part of the fleece
is called [kemp](kemp_(wool) "wikilink"). The relative amounts of kemp
to wool vary from breed to breed and make some fleeces more desirable
for [spinning](spinning_(textiles) "wikilink"),
[felting](felting "wikilink"), or [carding](carding "wikilink") into
[batts](batting_(material) "wikilink") for quilts or other insulating
products, including the famous [tweed](Tweed_(cloth) "wikilink") cloth
of [Scotland](Scotland "wikilink").

Wool fibers [readily absorb moisture](hydrophilic "wikilink"), but are
not hollow. Wool can absorb almost one-third of its own weight in
water.[5] Wool absorbs sound like many other fabrics. It is generally a
creamy white color, although some breeds of sheep produce natural
colors, such as black, brown, silver, and random mixes.

Wool ignites at a higher temperature than [cotton](cotton "wikilink")
and some synthetic fibers. It has a lower rate of [flame
spread](flame_spread "wikilink"), a lower rate of heat release, a lower
heat of combustion, and does not melt or drip;[6] it forms a char that
is insulating and self-extinguishing, and it contributes less to toxic
gases and smoke than other flooring products when used in carpets.[7]
Wool carpets are specified for high safety environments, such as trains
and aircraft. Wool is usually specified for garments for firefighters,
soldiers, and others in occupations where they are exposed to the
likelihood of fire.[8]

Wool causes an [allergic
reaction](allergic_contact_dermatitis "wikilink") in some people.[9]

## Processing

### Shearing

![](Merino_shearing.jpg "fig:Merino_shearing.jpg")\]\]

[Sheep shearing](Sheep_shearing "wikilink") is the process by which the
woolen fleece of a sheep is cut off. After shearing, the wool is
separated into four main categories: fleece (which makes up the vast
bulk), broken, bellies, and locks. The quality of fleeces is determined
by a technique known as [wool classing](wool_classing "wikilink"),
whereby a qualified person, called a wool classer, groups wools of
similar grading together to maximize the return for the farmer or sheep
owner. In [Australia](Australia "wikilink") before being auctioned, all
Merino fleece wool is objectively measured for
[micron](Micron_(wool) "wikilink"), yield (including the amount of
vegetable matter), staple length, staple strength, and sometimes color
and comfort factor.

### Scouring

![](CSIRO_ScienceImage_11160_Siroscour.jpg "CSIRO_ScienceImage_11160_Siroscour.jpg")

Wool straight off a sheep, known as "greasy wool"[10] or "wool in the
grease", contains a high level of valuable
[lanolin](lanolin "wikilink"), as well as the sheep's dead skin and
sweat residue, and generally also contains pesticides and vegetable
matter from the animal's environment. Before the wool can be used for
commercial purposes, it must be scoured, a process of cleaning the
greasy wool. Scouring may be as simple as a bath in warm water or as
complicated as an industrial process using
[detergent](detergent "wikilink") and [alkali](alkali "wikilink") in
specialized equipment.[11] In [north west
England](north_west_England "wikilink"), special [potash
pits](potash_pit "wikilink") were constructed to produce
[potash](potash "wikilink") used in the manufacture of a soft soap for
scouring locally produced white wool.

In commercial wool, vegetable matter is often removed by chemical
[carbonization](carbonization "wikilink").[12] In less-processed wools,
vegetable matter may be removed by hand and some of the lanolin left
intact through the use of gentler detergents. This semigrease wool can
be worked into yarn and knitted into particularly [water-resistant
mittens or sweaters](Aran_jumper "wikilink"), such as those of the [Aran
Island](Aran_Islands "wikilink") fishermen. Lanolin removed from wool is
widely used in [cosmetic](Cosmetics "wikilink") products, such as hand
creams.

## Fineness and yield

Raw wool has many impurities; vegetable matter, sand, dirt and yolk
which is a mixture of suint (sweat), grease, urine stains and dung
locks. The sheep's body yields many types of wool with differing
strengths, thicknesses, length of staple and impurities. The raw wool
(greasy) is processed into 'top'. 'Worsted top' requires strong straight
and parallel fibres.

![](Wool_samples_2.JPG "fig:Wool_samples_2.JPG") The quality of wool is
determined by its fiber diameter,
[crimp](Wool_classing#crimp "wikilink"), yield, color, and staple
strength. Fiber diameter is the single most important wool
characteristic determining quality and price.

Merino wool is typically 3–5 inches in length and is very fine (between
12 and 24 microns).[13] The finest and most valuable wool comes from
[Merino](Merino "wikilink") [hoggets](Domestic_sheep "wikilink"). Wool
taken from sheep produced for meat is typically more coarse, and has
fibers in length. Damage or breaks in the wool can occur if the sheep is
stressed while it is growing its fleece, resulting in a thin spot where
the fleece is likely to break.[14]

Wool is also separated into grades based on the measurement of the
wool's diameter in microns and also its style. These grades may vary
depending on the breed or purpose of the wool. For example:

| Diameter in microns | Name                 |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| \< 15.5             | Ultrafine Merino[15] |
| 15.6 – 18.5         | Superfine Merino     |
| 18.6 – 20           | Fine Merino[16]      |
| 20.1 – 23           | Medium Merino        |
| \> 23               | Strong Merino[17]    |

Breeds

Any wool finer than 25 microns can be used for garments, while coarser
grades are used for outerwear or rugs. The finer the wool, the softer it
is, while coarser grades are more durable and less prone to
[pilling](pill_(textile) "wikilink").

The finest Australian and New Zealand Merino wools are known as 1PP,
which is the industry benchmark of excellence for Merino wool 16.9
microns and finer. This style represents the top level of fineness,
character, color, and style as determined on the basis of a series of
parameters in accordance with the original dictates of British wool as
applied by the Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) Council. Only a few dozen
of the millions of bales auctioned every year can be classified and
marked 1PP.[20]

In the United States, three classifications of wool are named in the
Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939.[21] Wool is "the fiber from the
fleece of the sheep or lamb or hair of the Angora or Cashmere goat (and
may include the so-called specialty fibers from the hair of the camel,
alpaca, llama, and vicuna) which has never been reclaimed from any woven
or felted wool product".[22] "**Virgin wool**" and "**new wool**" are
also used to refer to such never used wool. There are two categories of
**recycled wool** (also called **reclaimed** or **shoddy wool**).
"**Reprocessed wool**" identifies "wool which has been woven or felted
into a wool product and subsequently reduced to a fibrous state without
having been used by the ultimate consumer".[23] "**Reused wool**" refers
to such wool that *has* been used by the ultimate consumer.[24]

## History

![](Tibetan_spinning_wool.jpg "fig:Tibetan_spinning_wool.jpg") [Wild
sheep](Mouflon "wikilink") were more hairy than woolly. Although sheep
were domesticated some 9,000 to 11,000 years ago, archaeological
evidence from [statuary](statuary "wikilink") found at sites in
[Iran](Iran "wikilink") suggests selection for woolly sheep may have
begun around 6000 BC,[25][26] with the earliest woven wool garments
having only been dated to two to three thousand years later.[27] Woolly
sheep were introduced into Europe from the Near East in the early part
of the 4th millennium BC. The oldest known European wool
[textile](textile "wikilink"), ca. 1500 BC, was preserved in a [Danish
bog](Bog_people "wikilink").[28] Prior to invention of shears—probably
in the [Iron Age](Iron_Age "wikilink")—the wool was plucked out by hand
or by [bronze](bronze "wikilink") combs. In
[Roman](Roman_Empire "wikilink") times, wool, [linen](linen "wikilink"),
and [leather](leather "wikilink") clothed the European population;
[cotton](cotton "wikilink") from [India](India "wikilink") was a
curiosity of which only naturalists had heard, and
[silks](silk "wikilink"), imported along the [Silk
Road](Silk_Road "wikilink") from [China](China "wikilink"), were
extravagant [luxury goods](luxury_goods "wikilink"). [Pliny the
Elder](Pliny_the_Elder "wikilink") records in his *[Natural
History](Natural_History_(Pliny) "wikilink")* that the reputation for
producing the finest wool was enjoyed by [Tarentum](Taranto "wikilink"),
where selective breeding had produced sheep with superior fleeces, but
which required special care.

In medieval times, as trade connections expanded, the [Champagne
fairs](Champagne_fairs "wikilink") revolved around the production of
wool cloth in small centers such as [Provins](Provins "wikilink"). The
network developed by the annual fairs meant the woolens of Provins might
find their way to [Naples](Naples "wikilink"),
[Sicily](Sicily "wikilink"), [Cyprus](Cyprus "wikilink"),
[Majorca](Majorca "wikilink"), [Spain](Spain "wikilink"), and even
[Constantinople](Constantinople "wikilink").[29] The wool trade
developed into serious business, a generator of capital.[30] In the 13th
century, the wool trade became the economic engine of the [Low
Countries](Low_Countries "wikilink") and central Italy. By the end of
the 14th century, Italy predominated, though Italian production turned
to silk in the 16th century.[31] Both industries, based on the export of
English raw wool, were rivaled only by the 15th-century
[sheepwalks](sheepwalk "wikilink") of
[Castile](Castile_(historical_region) "wikilink") and were a significant
source of income to the English crown, which in 1275 had imposed an
export tax on wool called the "Great Custom". The importance of wool to
the English economy can be seen in the fact that since the 14th century,
the presiding officer of the [House of Lords](House_of_Lords "wikilink")
has sat on the "[Woolsack](Woolsack "wikilink")", a chair stuffed with
wool.

[Economies of scale](Economies_of_scale "wikilink") were instituted in
the [Cistercian](Cistercian "wikilink") houses, which had accumulated
great tracts of land during the 12th and early 13th centuries, when land
prices were low and labor still scarce. Raw wool was baled and shipped
from [North Sea](North_Sea "wikilink") ports to the textile cities of
[Flanders](Flanders "wikilink"), notably [Ypres](Ypres "wikilink") and
[Ghent](Ghent "wikilink"), where it was dyed and worked up as cloth. At
the time of the [Black Death](Black_Death "wikilink"), English textile
industries accounted for about 10% of English wool production. The
English textile trade grew during the 15th century, to the point where
export of wool was discouraged. Over the centuries, various British laws
controlled the wool trade or required the use of wool even in burials.
The smuggling of wool out of the country, known as
[owling](Owling_(legal_term) "wikilink"), was at one time punishable by
the cutting off of a hand. After the
[Restoration](Restoration_(England) "wikilink"), fine English woolens
began to compete with silks in the international market, partly aided by
the [Navigation Acts](Navigation_Acts "wikilink"); in 1699, the English
crown forbade its American colonies to trade wool with anyone but
England herself.

A great deal of the value of woolen textiles was in the
[dyeing](dyeing "wikilink") and
[finishing](finishing_(textiles) "wikilink") of the woven product. In
each of the centers of the textile trade, the manufacturing process came
to be subdivided into a collection of trades, overseen by an
entrepreneur in a system called by the English the "putting-out" system,
or "cottage industry", and the *Verlagssystem* by the Germans. In this
system of producing wool cloth, once perpetuated in the production of
[Harris tweeds](Harris_tweed "wikilink"), the entrepreneur provides the
raw materials and an advance, the remainder being paid upon delivery of
the product. Written contracts bound the artisans to specified terms.
[Fernand Braudel](Fernand_Braudel "wikilink") traces the appearance of
the system in the 13th-century economic boom, quoting a document of
1275.[32] The system effectively bypassed the guilds' restrictions.

Before the flowering of the [Renaissance](Renaissance "wikilink"), the
[Medici](Medici "wikilink") and other great banking houses of Florence
had built their wealth and banking system on their textile industry
based on wool, overseen by the [Arte della
Lana](Arte_della_Lana "wikilink"), the wool guild: wool textile
interests guided Florentine policies. [Francesco
Datini](Francesco_Datini "wikilink"), the "merchant of Prato",
established in 1383 an *Arte della Lana* for that small Tuscan city. The
sheepwalks of [Castile](Castile_(historical_region) "wikilink") shaped
the landscape and the fortunes of the
*[meseta](Meseta_Central "wikilink")* that lies in the heart of the
Iberian peninsula; in the 16th century, a unified Spain allowed export
of [Merino](Merino "wikilink") lambs only with royal permission. The
German wool market – based on sheep of Spanish origin – did not overtake
British wool until comparatively late . The [Industrial
Revolution](Industrial_Revolution "wikilink") introduced mass production
technology into wool and wool cloth manufacturing. Australia's colonial
economy was based on sheep raising, and the Australian wool trade
eventually overtook that of the Germans by 1845, furnishing wool for
[Bradford](Bradford "wikilink"), which developed as the heart of
industrialized woolens production.

Agriculture](United_States_Department_of_Agriculture "wikilink")
encouraging children to raise sheep to provide needed war supplies\]\]

Due to decreasing demand with increased use of synthetic fibers, wool
production is much less than what it was in the past. The collapse in
the price of wool began in late 1966 with a 40% drop; with occasional
interruptions, the price has tended down. The result has been sharply
reduced production and movement of resources into production of other
commodities, in the case of sheep growers, to production of
meat.[33][34][35]

Superwash wool (or washable wool) technology first appeared in the early
1970s to produce wool that has been specially treated so it is machine
washable and may be tumble-dried. This wool is produced using an acid
bath that removes the "scales" from the fiber, or by coating the fiber
with a polymer that prevents the scales from attaching to each other and
causing shrinkage. This process results in a fiber that holds longevity
and durability over synthetic materials, while retaining its shape.[36]

In December 2004, a bale of the then world's finest wool, averaging 11.8
microns, sold for AU$3,000 per kilogram at auction in
[Melbourne](Melbourne "wikilink"),
[Victoria](Victoria_(Australia) "wikilink"). This fleece wool tested
with an average yield of 74.5%, 68 mm long, and had 40 newtons per
[kilotex](kilotex "wikilink") strength. The result was A$279,000 for the
bale.[37] The finest bale of wool ever [auctioned](auction "wikilink")
was sold for a seasonal record of AU$2690 per kilo during June 2008.
This bale was produced by the Hillcreston Pinehill Partnership and
measured 11.6 microns, 72.1% yield, and had a 43 newtons per kilotex
strength measurement. The bale realized $247,480 and was exported to
[India](India "wikilink").[38]

In 2007, a new wool suit was developed and sold in Japan that can be
washed in the shower, and which dries off ready to wear within hours
with no ironing required. The suit was developed using Australian Merino
wool, and it enables woven products made from wool, such as suits,
trousers, and skirts, to be cleaned using a domestic shower at home.[39]

In December 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed
2009 to be the [International Year of Natural
Fibres](International_Year_of_Natural_Fibres "wikilink"), so as to raise
the profile of wool and other [natural
fibers](natural_fiber "wikilink").

## Production

Global wool production is about 2 million tonnes per year, of which 60%
goes into apparel. Wool comprises ca 3% of the global textile market,
but its value is higher owing to dying and other modifications of the
material.[40] Australia is a leading producer of wool which is mostly
from Merino sheep but has been eclipsed by China in terms of total
weight.[41] New Zealand (2016) is the third-largest producer of wool,
and the largest producer of crossbred wool. Breeds such as
[Lincoln](Lincoln_(sheep) "wikilink"),
[Romney](Romney_(sheep) "wikilink"),
[Drysdale](Drysdale_(sheep) "wikilink"), and
[Elliotdale](Elliotdale "wikilink") produce coarser fibers, and wool
from these sheep is usually used for making
[carpets](carpet "wikilink").

In the United States, [Texas](Texas "wikilink"), [New
Mexico](New_Mexico "wikilink"), and [Colorado](Colorado "wikilink") have
large commercial sheep flocks and their mainstay is the
[Rambouillet](Rambouillet_(sheep) "wikilink") (or French Merino). Also,
a thriving home-flock contingent of small-scale farmers raise small
hobby flocks of specialty sheep for the hand-spinning market. These
small-scale farmers offer a wide selection of fleece. Global woolclip

Organic wool is becoming more and more popular. This wool is very
limited in supply and much of it comes from New Zealand and
Australia.[43] It is becoming easier to find in clothing and other
products, but these products often carry a higher price. Wool is
environmentally preferable (as compared to petroleum-based
[nylon](nylon "wikilink") or [polypropylene](polypropylene "wikilink"))
as a material for [carpets](Carpetlayer "wikilink"), as well, in
particular when combined with a natural binding and the use of
[formaldehyde](formaldehyde "wikilink")-free glues.

[Animal rights](Animal_rights "wikilink") groups have noted issues with
the production of wool, such as [mulesing](mulesing "wikilink").

## Marketing

### Australia

![](CSIRO_ScienceImage_1054_Wool_Fibre_of_the_gods.jpg "fig:CSIRO_ScienceImage_1054_Wool_Fibre_of_the_gods.jpg")
marketing poster describing the benefits of wool\]\]
![](Wool_samples.JPG "fig:Wool_samples.JPG"), Newcastle, [New South
Wales](New_South_Wales "wikilink")\]\] About 85% of wool sold in
Australia is sold by open cry [auction](auction "wikilink").[44] "Sale
by sample" is a method in which a mechanical claw takes a sample from
each bale in a line or lot of wool. These grab samples are bulked,
objectively measured, and a sample of not less than 4 kg is displayed in
a box for the buyer to examine. The Australian Wool Exchange conducts
sales primarily in [Sydney](Sydney "wikilink"),
[Melbourne](Melbourne "wikilink"),
[Newcastle](Newcastle,_New_South_Wales "wikilink"), and
[Fremantle](Fremantle "wikilink"). About 80 brokers and agents work
throughout Australia.

![](ABS-7215.0-LivestockProductsAustralia-BrokersDealersReceivalsTaxableWool-AllSeries-BrokersDealersReceivalsTaxableWool-Australia-A2060656A.svg "fig:ABS-7215.0-LivestockProductsAustralia-BrokersDealersReceivalsTaxableWool-AllSeries-BrokersDealersReceivalsTaxableWool-Australia-A2060656A.svg")
![](Wool_auction.JPG "fig:Wool_auction.JPG") About 7% of Australian wool
is sold by private treaty on farms or to local wool-handling facilities.
This option gives wool growers benefit from reduced transport,
warehousing, and selling costs. This method is preferred for small lots
or mixed butts to make savings on reclassing and testing.

About 5% of Australian wool is sold over the internet on an electronic
offer board. This option gives wool growers the ability to set firm
price targets, reoffer passed-in wool, and offer lots to the market
quickly and efficiently. This method works well for tested lots, as
buyers use these results to make a purchase. About 97% of wool is sold
without sample inspection; however, as of December 2009, 59% of wool
listed had been passed in from auction. Growers through certain brokers
can allocate their wool to a sale and at what price their wool will be
reserved.

Sale by tender can achieve considerable cost savings on wool clips large
enough to make it worthwhile for potential buyers to submit tenders.
Some marketing firms sell wool on a consignment basis, obtaining a fixed
percentage as commission.

Forward selling: Some buyers offer a secure price for forward delivery
of wool based on estimated measurements or the results of previous
clips. Prices are quoted at current market rates and are locked in for
the season. Premiums and discounts are added to cover variations in
micron, yield, tensile strength, etc., which are confirmed by actual
test results when available.

Another method of selling wool includes sales direct to [wool
mills](wool_mill "wikilink").

### Other countries

The [British Wool Marketing
Board](British_Wool_Marketing_Board "wikilink") operates a central
marketing system for UK fleece wool with the aim of achieving the best
possible net returns for farmers.

Less than half of New Zealand's wool is sold at auction, while around
45% of farmers sell wool directly to private buyers and end-users.[45]

United States sheep producers market wool with private or cooperative
wool warehouses, but wool pools are common in many states. In some
cases, wool is pooled in a local market area, but sold through a wool
warehouse. Wool offered with objective measurement test results is
preferred. Imported apparel wool and carpet wool goes directly to
central markets, where it is handled by the large merchants and
manufacturers.[46]

## Yarn

![](Worsted_wool_yarn.JPG "fig:Worsted_wool_yarn.JPG")\]\]

[Shoddy](Shoddy "wikilink") or recycled wool is made by cutting or
tearing apart existing wool fabric and respinning the resulting
fibers.[47] As this process makes the wool fibers shorter, the
remanufactured fabric is inferior to the original. The recycled wool may
be mixed with raw wool, wool [noil](noil "wikilink"), or another fiber
such as [cotton](cotton "wikilink") to increase the average fiber
length. Such [yarns](yarn "wikilink") are typically used as
[weft](weft "wikilink") yarns with a cotton
[warp](warp_(weaving) "wikilink"). This process was invented in the
[Heavy Woollen District](Heavy_Woollen_District "wikilink") of [West
Yorkshire](West_Yorkshire "wikilink") and created a microeconomy in this
area for many years.

[Worsted](Worsted "wikilink") is a strong,
long-[staple](staple_(wool) "wikilink"), [combed](combing "wikilink")
wool yarn with a hard surface.[48]

[Woolen](Woolen "wikilink") is a soft, short-staple,
[carded](carding "wikilink") wool yarn typically used for knitting.[49]
In traditional weaving, woolen weft yarn (for softness and warmth) is
frequently combined with a worsted warp yarn for strength on the
loom.[50]

## Uses

In addition to clothing, wool has been used for blankets, horse rugs,
saddle cloths, carpeting, insulation and upholstery. Wool felt covers
piano hammers, and it is used to absorb odors and noise in heavy
machinery and stereo speakers. Ancient Greeks lined their helmets with
felt, and Roman legionnaires used breastplates made of wool felt.

Wool has also been traditionally used to cover [cloth
diapers](cloth_diapers "wikilink").[51] Wool fiber exteriors are
hydrophobic (repel water) and the interior of the wool fiber is
[hygroscopic](hygroscopic "wikilink") (attracts water); this makes a
wool garment suitable cover for a wet diaper by inhibiting wicking, so
outer garments remain dry. Wool felted and treated with
[lanolin](lanolin "wikilink") is water resistant, air permeable, and
slightly antibacterial, so it resists the buildup of odor. Some modern
cloth diapers use felted wool fabric for covers, and there are several
modern commercial knitting patterns for wool diaper covers.

Initial studies of woolen underwear have found it prevented heat and
sweat rashes because it more readily absorbs the moisture than other
fibers.[52]

Merino wool has been used in baby sleep products such as
[swaddle](swaddle "wikilink") baby wrap blankets and [infant sleeping
bags](sleeping_bag_(infant) "wikilink").

As an animal protein, wool can be used as a soil fertilizer, being a
slow-release source of nitrogen.

Researchers at the [Royal Melbourne Institute of
Technology](Royal_Melbourne_Institute_of_Technology "wikilink") school
of fashion and textiles have discovered a blend of wool and
[Kevlar](Kevlar "wikilink"), the synthetic fiber widely used in body
armor, was lighter, cheaper and worked better in damp conditions than
Kevlar alone. Kevlar, when used alone, loses about 20% of its
effectiveness when wet, so required an expensive waterproofing process.
Wool increased friction in a vest with 28–30 layers of fabric, to
provide the same level of bullet resistance as 36 layers of Kevlar
alone.[53]

## Events

![](Lady_Weaving_Wool.JPG "fig:Lady_Weaving_Wool.JPG") woman sorting
wool as part of the theme park [Los Aleros](Los_Aleros "wikilink") in
[Mérida](Mérida,_Mérida "wikilink"),
[Venezuela](Venezuela "wikilink")\]\] A buyer of [Merino
wool](Merino_wool "wikilink"), [Ermenegildo
Zegna](Ermenegildo_Zegna "wikilink"), has offered awards for Australian
wool producers. In 1963, the first Ermenegildo Zegna Perpetual Trophy
was presented in Tasmania for growers of "Superfine skirted Merino
fleece". In 1980, a national award, the Ermenegildo Zegna Trophy for
Extrafine Wool Production, was launched. In 2004, this award became
known as the Ermenegildo Zegna Unprotected Wool Trophy. In 1998, an
Ermenegildo Zegna Protected Wool Trophy was launched for fleece from
sheep coated for around nine months of the year.

In 2002, the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum Trophy was launched for
wool that is 13.9 microns or finer. Wool from Australia, New Zealand,
Argentina, and South Africa may enter, and a winner is named from each
country.[54] In April 2008, New Zealand won the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus
Aureum Trophy for the first time with a fleece that measured 10.8
microns. This contest awards the winning fleece weight with the same
weight in gold as a prize, hence the name.

In 2010, an ultrafine, 10-micron fleece, from Windradeen, near Pyramul,
New South Wales, won the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum International
Trophy.[55]

Since 2000, [Loro Piana](Loro_Piana "wikilink") has awarded a cup for
the world's finest bale of wool that produces just enough fabric for 50
tailor-made suits. The prize is awarded to an Australian or New Zealand
wool grower who produces the year's finest bale.[56]

The [New England](New_England_(Australia) "wikilink") Merino Field days
which display local studs, wool, and sheep are held during January, in
even numbered years around the [Walcha, New South
Wales](Walcha,_New_South_Wales "wikilink") district. The Annual Wool
Fashion Awards, which showcase the use of Merino wool by fashion
designers, are hosted by the city of [Armidale, New South
Wales](Armidale,_New_South_Wales "wikilink"), in March each year. This
event encourages young and established fashion designers to display
their talents. During each May, Armidale hosts the annual New England
Wool Expo to display wool fashions, handicrafts, demonstrations,
shearing competitions, yard dog trials, and more.[57]

In July, the annual Australian Sheep and Wool Show is held in [Bendigo,
Victoria](Bendigo,_Victoria "wikilink"). This is the largest sheep and
wool show in the world, with goats and alpacas, as well as woolcraft
competitions and displays, fleece competitions, sheepdog trials,
shearing, and wool handling. The largest competition in the world for
objectively measured fleeces is the Australian Fleece Competition, which
is held annually at Bendigo. In 2008, 475 entries came from all states
of Australia, with first and second prizes going to the [Northern
Tablelands, New South
Wales](Northern_Tablelands,_New_South_Wales "wikilink") fleeces.[58]
