**Magenta** () is a [color](/color "wikilink") that is variously defined
as purplish-red,[1] reddish-[purple](/purple "wikilink") or
[mauvish](/mauve "wikilink")-[crimson](/crimson "wikilink").[2] On
[color wheels](/color_wheel "wikilink") of the [RGB
(additive)](/RGB_color_model "wikilink") and [CMY
(subtractive)](/subtractive_color "wikilink") color models, it is
located midway between [red](/red "wikilink") and
[blue](/blue "wikilink"). It is one of the four colors of ink used in
color printing by an [inkjet printer](/inkjet_printer "wikilink"), along
with [yellow](/yellow "wikilink"), [black](/black "wikilink"), and
[cyan](/cyan "wikilink"), to make all the other colors. The tone of
magenta used in [printing](/printing "wikilink") is called "printer's
magenta".

Magenta took its name from an [aniline](/aniline "wikilink") dye made
and patented in 1859 by the French chemist François-Emmanuel Verguin,
who originally called it *fuchsine*. It was renamed to celebrate the
Italian-French victory at the [Battle of
Magenta](/Battle_of_Magenta "wikilink") fought between the French and
Austrians on June 4, 1859, near the Italian town of
[Magenta](/Magenta,_Lombardy "wikilink") in
[Lombardy](/Lombardy "wikilink").[3][4] A virtually identical color,
called roseine, was created in 1860 by two British chemists: Chambers
Nicolson and George Maule.

The [web color](/web_colors "wikilink") magenta is also called
[fuchsia](/fuchsia_(color) "wikilink").

## In optics and color science

Magenta is an [extra-spectral
color](/spectral_color#Non-spectral_colors "wikilink"), meaning that it
is not a hue associated with monochromatic [visible
light](/visible_light "wikilink"). Magenta is associated with perception
of [spectral power
distributions](/spectral_power_distribution "wikilink") concentrated
mostly in longer wavelength reddish components and shorter wavelength
blueish components.[5]

In the RGB color system, used to create all the colors on a television
or computer display, magenta is a secondary color, made by combining
equal amounts of red and blue light at a high intensity. In this system,
magenta is the [complementary color](/complementary_color "wikilink") of
green, and combining green and magenta light on a black screen will
create white.

In the [CMYK color model](/CMYK_color_model "wikilink"), used in color
printing, it is one of the three primary colors, along with cyan and
yellow, used to print all the rest of the colors. If magenta, cyan, and
yellow are printed on top of each other on a page, they make black. In
this model, magenta is the complementary color of green, and these two
colors have the highest contrast and the greatest harmony. If combined,
green and magenta ink will look dark gray or black. The magenta used in
color printing, sometimes called process magenta, is a darker shade than
the color used on computer screens.

A [purple](/Line_of_purples "wikilink") hue in terms of [color
theory](/color_theory "wikilink"), magenta is evoked by light having
less power in green [wavelengths](/wavelength "wikilink") than in
blue/violet and red wavelengths
([complements](/complementary_color "wikilink") of magenta have
wavelength 500–530 [nm](/nanometer "wikilink")).[6]

In the [Munsell color system](/Munsell_color_system "wikilink"), magenta
is called *red–purple*.

If the spectrum is wrapped to form a color wheel, magenta (additive
secondary) appears midway between [red](/red "wikilink") and violet.
Violet and red, the two components of magenta, are at opposite ends of
the visible spectrum and have very different wavelengths. The additive
secondary color magenta, as noted above, is made by combining violet and
red light at equal intensity; it is not present in the spectrum itself.

<File:RGB> illumination.jpg\|In the [RGB color
model](/RGB_color_model "wikilink"), used to make colors on computer and
television displays, magenta is created by the combination of equal
amounts of blue and red light. <File:RBG> color wheel.svg\|In the RGB
color wheel of [additive colors](/additive_colors "wikilink"), magenta
is midway between blue and red. <File:SubtractiveColor.svg%7CIn> the
[CMYK color model](/CMYK_color_model "wikilink"), used in color
printing, [cyan](/cyan "wikilink"), magenta, and
[yellow](/yellow "wikilink") combined make black. In practice, since the
inks are not perfect, some black ink is added. <File:Linear> visible

## Fuchsia and magenta

In optics, [fuchsia](/fuchsia_(color) "wikilink") and magenta are
essentially the same color. The [web colors](/web_colors "wikilink")
fuchsia and magenta are completely identical, and are made by mixing
exactly the same proportions of blue and red light. In design and
printing, there is a little more variation. The French version of
fuchsia in the [RGB color model](/RGB_color_model "wikilink") and in
printing contains a higher proportion of red than the American version
of fuchsia. [Fuchsia](/Fuchsia "wikilink") flowers themselves, which
inspired both colors, have a variety of colors, from fuchsia to purple
to red.

## History

### Fuchsine and magenta dye (1859)

[thumb\|160px\|right\|An 1864 map showing the Duchy of Bouillon in
magenta](/File:Carte_du_Duché_de_Bouillon_(1864).jpg "wikilink") The
color magenta was the result of the industrial chemistry revolution of
the mid-nineteenth century, which began with the invention by [William
Perkin](/William_Perkin "wikilink") of [mauveine](/mauveine "wikilink")
in 1856, which was the first synthetic [aniline
dye](/aniline_dye "wikilink"). The enormous commercial success of the
dye and the new color it produced, [mauve](/mauve "wikilink"), inspired
other chemists in Europe to develop new colors made from aniline
dyes.[7]

In France, François-Emmanuel Verguin, the director of the chemical
factory of Louis Rafard near [Lyon](/Lyon "wikilink"), tried many
different formulae before finally in late 1858 or early 1859, mixing
aniline with [carbon tetrachloride](/carbon_tetrachloride "wikilink"),
producing a reddish-purple dye which he called
"[fuchsine](/fuchsine "wikilink")", after the color of the flower of the
fuchsia plant.[8] He quit the Rafard factory and took his color to a
firm of paint manufacturers, Francisque and Joseph Renard, who began to
manufacture the dye in 1859.

In the same year, two British chemists, Chambers Nicolson and George
Maule, working at the laboratory of the paint manufacturer George
Simpson, located in Walworth, south of London, made another aniline dye
with a similar red-purple color, which they began to manufacture in 1860
under the name "roseine". In 1860 they changed the name of the color to
"magenta", in honor of the [Battle of
Magenta](/Battle_of_Magenta "wikilink") fought between the French and
Austrians at [Magenta, Lombardy](/Magenta,_Lombardy "wikilink") the year
before, and the new color became a commercial success.[9][10]

Starting in 1935 the family of [quinacridone](/quinacridone "wikilink")
dyes was developed. These have colors ranging from red to violet, so
nowadays a quinacridone dye is often used for magenta. Various tones of
magenta—light, bright, brilliant, vivid, rich, or deep—may be formulated
by adding varying amounts of white to quinacridone artist's paints.

Another dye used for magenta is [Lithol Rubine
BK](/Lithol_Rubine_BK "wikilink"). One of its uses is as a food
coloring.

### Process magenta (pigment magenta; printer's magenta) (1890s)

In [color printing](/color_printing "wikilink"), the color called
**process magenta**, **pigment magenta**, or **printer's magenta** is
one of the three primary pigment colors which, along with
[yellow](/yellow "wikilink") and [cyan](/cyan "wikilink"), constitute
the three [subtractive primary
colors](/Primary_colors#Subtractive_primaries "wikilink") of pigment.
(The secondary colors of pigment are blue, green, and red.) As such, the
hue magenta is the [complement](/complementary_color "wikilink") of
[green](/green "wikilink"): magenta [pigments](/pigment "wikilink")
absorb green light; thus magenta and green are opposite colors.

The [CMYK](/CMYK "wikilink") printing process was invented in the 1890s,
when newspapers began to publish color [comic
strips](/comic_strip "wikilink").

Process magenta is not an [RGB](/RGB "wikilink") color, and there is no
fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are
used for printer's ink, so there may be variations in the printed color
that is pure magenta ink. A typical formulation of *process magenta* is
shown in the color box at right.

### Web colors magenta and fuchsia

At right is the [web color](/web_color "wikilink") **magenta**. It is
one of the three secondary colors in the [RGB color
model](/RGB_color_model "wikilink"). On the [RGB color
wheel](/:File:RBG_color_wheel.svg "wikilink"), magenta is the color
between [rose](/Rose_(color) "wikilink") and
[violet](/Violet_(color) "wikilink"), and halfway between
[red](/red "wikilink") and [blue](/blue "wikilink").

This color is called *magenta* in [X11](/X11_color_names "wikilink") and
*fuchsia* in [HTML](/HTML "wikilink"). In the RGB color model, it is
created by combining equal intensities of red and blue light. The two
web colors magenta and **fuchsia** are exactly the same color. Sometimes
the web color magenta is called *electric magenta* or *electronic
magenta*.

While the magenta used in printing and the web color have the same name,
they have important differences. Process magenta (the color used for
magenta printing ink—also called printer's or pigment magenta) is much
less vivid than the color magenta achievable on a computer screen. CMYK
printing technology cannot accurately reproduce on paper the color on
the computer screen. When the web color magenta is reproduced on paper,
it is called fuchsia and it is physically impossible for it to appear on
paper as vivid as on a computer screen.

Colored pencils and [crayons](/crayon "wikilink") called "magenta" are
usually colored the color of *process magenta* (*printer's magenta*)
shown above.

## In science and culture

### In art

-   [Paul Gauguin](/Paul_Gauguin "wikilink") (1848–1903) used a shade of
    magenta in 1890 in his portrait of Marie Lagadu, and in some of his
    South Seas paintings.
-   [Henri Matisse](/Henri_Matisse "wikilink") and the members of the
    [Fauvist](/Fauvist "wikilink") movement used magenta and other
    non-traditional colors to surprise viewers, and to move their
    emotions through the use of bold colors.
-   Since the mid-1960s, water based fluorescent magenta paint has been
    available to paint [psychedelic](/psychedelic_art "wikilink") [black
    light](/black_light "wikilink") [paintings](/painting "wikilink").
    (Fluorescent [cerise](/Cerise_(color) "wikilink"), fluorescent
    [chartreuse yellow](/chartreuse_yellow "wikilink"), fluorescent
    blue, and fluorescent green.)

<File:Bouguereau-Psyche.jpg%7CMagenta>, along with mauve, made with the
newly discovered [aniline dyes](/aniline_dyes "wikilink"), became a
popular fashion color in the second half of the nineteenth century. It
appeared in art in this 1890 work, *Psyche*, by
[Bouguereau](/Bouguereau "wikilink"). <File:Paul> Gauguin 099.jpg\|[Paul
Gauguin](/Paul_Gauguin "wikilink"), *Portrait of Marie Lagadu* (1890).
<File:Matissetoits.gif>\|[Henri Matisse](/Henri_Matisse "wikilink"),
*Les toits de Collioure* (1905). Henri Matisse and the other painters of
the [Fauvist](/Fauvist "wikilink") movement were the first to make a
major use of magenta to surprise and make an impact on the emotions of
the viewer. <File:1967> Mantra-Rock Dance Avalon poster.jpg\|In the
1960s, magenta was a popular color in [psychedelic
art](/psychedelic_art "wikilink"), such as this concert poster for the
[Avalon Ballroom](/Avalon_Ballroom "wikilink") in [San
Francisco](/San_Francisco "wikilink") (1967).

### In astronomy

-   Astronomers have reported that [spectral
    class](/Stellar_classification "wikilink") T brown dwarfs (the ones
    with the coolest temperatures except for the recently discovered Y
    brown dwarfs) are colored magenta because of absorption by
    [sodium](/sodium "wikilink") and [potassium](/potassium "wikilink")
    [atoms](/atom "wikilink") of light in the green portion of the
    spectrum.[11][12][13]

### In botany

Magenta is a common color for flowers, particularly in the tropics and
sub-tropics. Because magenta is the complementary color of green,
magenta flowers have the highest contrast with the green foliage, and
therefore are more visible to the animals needed for their pollination.

### In business

The [German](/Germany "wikilink") [telecommunications
company](/telecommunications_company "wikilink") [Deutsche
Telekom](/Deutsche_Telekom "wikilink") uses a magenta
[logo](/logo "wikilink"). It has sought to prevent use of any similar
color by other businesses, even those in unrelated fields, such as the
insurance company [Lemonade](/Lemonade_(insurance) "wikilink").[14]

### In public transport

Magenta was the English name of Tokyo's
[Oedo](/Toei_Ōedo_Line "wikilink") subway line color. It was later
alternated to *[ruby](/ruby "wikilink")*.

### In transportation

In aircraft [autopilot](/autopilot "wikilink") systems, the path that
pilot or plane should follow to its destination is usually indicated in
cockpit displays using the color magenta.[15]

### In numismatics

The [Reserve Bank of India](/Reserve_Bank_of_India "wikilink") (RBI)
issued a Magenta colored banknote of
[₹2000](/Indian_2000-rupee_note "wikilink") denomination on 8 November
2016 under [Mahatma Gandhi New
Series](/Mahatma_Gandhi_New_Series "wikilink"). This is the highest
currency note printed by RBI that is in active circulation in
[India](/India "wikilink").

### In vexillology and heraldry

Magenta is an extremely rare color to find on heraldic flags and coats
of arms, since its adoption dates back to relatively recent times.
However, there are some examples of its use:

[File:Cantabrian_Lábaru_Flag.svg](File:Cantabrian_Lábaru_Flag.svg)\|[Cantabrian

<File:Flag> of Cartago (Valle del Cauca).svg\| Flag of the [municipality
of Cartago](/Cartago,_Colombia "wikilink"),
[Colombia](/Colombia "wikilink").

### In politics

-   The color magenta is used to symbolize
    [anti-racism](/anti-racism "wikilink") by the
    [Amsterdam](/Amsterdam "wikilink")-based anti-racism Magenta
    Foundation.[16]
-   In Danish politics the magenta is the color of [Det Radikale
    Venstre](/Det_Radikale_Venstre "wikilink"), the Danish
    social-liberal party.
