**Mauveine**, also known as **aniline purple** and **Perkin's mauve**,
was one of the first synthetic [dyes](/dye "wikilink").[1][2] It was
discovered [serendipitously](/serendipity "wikilink") by [William Henry
Perkin](/William_Henry_Perkin "wikilink") in 1856 while he was
attempting to create a cure for [malaria](/malaria "wikilink").[3] It is
also among the first chemical dyes to have been mass-produced.[4][5]

## Chemistry

Mauveine is a mixture of four related
[aromatic](/aromaticity "wikilink") compounds differing in number and
placement of [methyl groups](/methyl_group "wikilink"). Its [organic
synthesis](/organic_synthesis "wikilink") involves dissolving
[aniline](/aniline "wikilink"),
[*p*-toluidine](/p-toluidine "wikilink"), and
[*o*-toluidine](/o-toluidine "wikilink") in [sulfuric
acid](/sulfuric_acid "wikilink") and water in a roughly 1:1:2 ratio,
then adding [potassium dichromate](/potassium_dichromate "wikilink").[6]

**Mauveine A**
(C<sub>26</sub>H<sub>23</sub>N<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>X<sup>−</sup>)
incorporates 2 molecules of [aniline](/aniline "wikilink"), one of
*p*-toluidine, and one of *o*-toluidine. **Mauveine B**
(C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>25</sub>N<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>X<sup>−</sup>)
incorporates one molecule each of aniline, *p*-toluidine, and two of
*o*-toluidine. In 1879, Perkin showed mauveine B related to
[safranines](/safranine "wikilink") by
[oxidative](/oxidation "wikilink")/[reductive](/Redox "wikilink") loss
of the *p*-tolyl group.[7] In fact, [safranine](/safranine "wikilink")
is a 2,8-dimethyl [phenazinium](/phenazine "wikilink") salt, whereas the
[parasafranine](/parasafranine "wikilink") produced by Perkin is
presumed[8] to be the 1,8-(or 2,9) dimethyl
[isomer](/isomer "wikilink").

The molecular structure of mauveine proved difficult to determine,
finally being identified in 1994.[9] In 2007, two more were isolated and
identified: **mauveine B2**, an isomer of mauveine B with methyl on
different aryl group, and **mauveine C**, which has one more *p*-methyl
group than mauveine A.[10]

In 2008, additional mauveines and pseudomauveines were discovered,
bringing the total number of these compounds up to 12.[11]. In 2015 a
crystal structure was reported for the first time.[12]

## History

[thumb\|Professor [Charles Rees](Charles_Rees "wikilink")—wearing bow
tie dyed with original sample of mauveine—holding
[RSC](/Royal_Society_of_Chemistry "wikilink") journal named after
Perkin](/File:Charles_Rees_(in_mauveine-dyed_bowtie).jpg "wikilink")

In 1856, [William Henry Perkin](/Sir_William_Henry_Perkin "wikilink"),
then age 18, was given a challenge by his professor, [August Wilhelm von
Hofmann](/August_Wilhelm_von_Hofmann "wikilink"), to synthesize
[quinine](/quinine "wikilink"). In one attempt, Perkin
[oxidized](/oxidation "wikilink") aniline using [potassium
dichromate](/potassium_dichromate "wikilink"), whose
[toluidine](/toluidine "wikilink") impurities reacted with the aniline
and yielded a black solid, suggesting a "failed" organic synthesis.
Cleaning the flask with alcohol, Perkin noticed
[purple](/purple "wikilink") portions of the solution.

Suitable as a dye of [silk](/silk "wikilink") and other
[textiles](/textile "wikilink"), it was [patented](/patent "wikilink")
by Perkin, who the next year opened a dyeworks mass-producing it at
[Greenford](/Greenford "wikilink") on the banks of the [Grand Union
Canal](/Grand_Union_Canal "wikilink") in [
Middlesex](/_Middlesex "wikilink").[13] It was originally called
*aniline purple*. In 1859, it was named *[mauve](/mauve "wikilink")* in
England via the French name for the [mallow](/Malva "wikilink") flower,
and chemists later called it mauveine.[14] By 1870, demand succumbed to
newer synthetic colors in the [synthetic dye](/synthetic_dye "wikilink")
industry launched by mauveine.

In the early 20th century, the U.S. National Association of
Confectioners permitted mauveine as a food coloring with a variety of
equivalent names: *rosolan*, *violet paste*, *chrome violet*, *anilin
violet*, *anilin purple*, *Perkin's violet*, *indisin*, *phenamin*,
*purpurin* and *lydin*.[15]

Laborers in the aniline dye industry were later found to be at increased
risk of bladder cancer, specifically [transitional cell
carcinoma](/transitional_cell_carcinoma "wikilink"), yet by the 1950s,
the synthetic dye industry had [helped transform
medicine](/Aniline#History "wikilink"), including cancer
treatment.[16][17][18]
