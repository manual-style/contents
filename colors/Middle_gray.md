([Y](/Tristimulus_colorimeter "wikilink") {{=}} {{#expr:
((50+16)/116)^3\*100 round 1}}/100.)\|right}} In
[photography](/photography "wikilink"),
[painting](/painting "wikilink"), and other visual arts, **middle gray**
or **middle grey** is a tone that is perceptually about halfway between
black and white on a [lightness](/lightness_(color) "wikilink")
scale;[1] in photography, and printing, it is typically defined as 18%
reflectance in visible light.[2] This gray reflects exactly 1/5th the
number of photons per square unit as compared to a reference white of
90% reflectance.[3]

Middle gray is the universal measurement standard in photographic
cameras. To calibrate light meters, whether in a camera or hand held,
the 18% [gray card](/gray_card "wikilink") was conceived. It is assumed
that the measurement taken by a meter gives the exposure for a shot so
that some of the light reflected by the object measured is equivalent to
middle gray.[4] Because human perception adjusts to the overall
brightness level (and is logarithmic rather than linear), the perceived
middle gray is subjective to the observer. This must be kept in mind
when using a camera with a built in light meter (which is neither
subjective nor logarithmic). Most scenes reflect just 12% to 13% of
incident light falling upon them. Therefore, the camera light meter
assumes an 18% gray level. This can easily be observed when one relies
solely on the exposure given by a camera with a built in light meter
when taking a snow scene - the image will come out dark. Using an 18%
gray card as an expose guide will mitigate this error.

In the sRGB color space, CIELAB middle gray is equivalent to 46.6%
brightness.[5] In 24-bit color, this is rounded to RGB value
(119,119,119) or #777777.[6]

## History

In the [Zone System](/Zone_System "wikilink") of [Ansel
Adams](/Ansel_Adams "wikilink"), middle gray is known as "Zone V" in the
scale of 11 zones from Zone 0 (black) to Zone X (white).[7]

As early as 1903, middle gray was defined as the [geometric
mean](/geometric_mean "wikilink") intensity between a white and a black
intensity that are in a ratio of 60:1.[8] That is equivalent to 12.9% of
the white intensity.

## Table of middle grays

Below are various "middle" grays as based on various criteria. In the
center of the rendering of the "Absolute whiteness" middle gray, a small
black and white checkered image has been included which, if viewed from
a distance, should look like a gray with exactly 50% whiteness. On a
correctly calibrated sRGB monitor, this should appear to be of equal
brightness to rgb(188,188,188) or #BCBCBC.

[9] LCD screens, even when correctly calibrated, often have a brightness
that varies considerably depending on the viewing angle. Try stepping
back and changing your position until the checkered image in the center
of the absolute middle gray (50% relative whiteness) appears to dissolve
into the background. If the image does not appear to be of the same
brightness, then the "middle grays" rendered in the table are NOT
correctly displayed on your screen. (Also take care to make sure your
browser window is not zoomed since any magnification may distort the
brightness depending on how your browser adjusts for gamma when blending
the pixels, e.g. rendering the zoomed image at sRGB middle gray, or 21%
whiteness, instead of 50%.).
