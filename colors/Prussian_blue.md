**Prussian blue** is a dark blue [pigment](/pigment "wikilink") produced
by oxidation of ferrous ferrocyanide salts. It has the [chemical
formula](/chemical_formula "wikilink")
Fe\[Fe([CN](/Cyanide "wikilink"))\]. Another name for the color is
**Berlin blue** or, in [painting](/painting "wikilink"), **Parisian** or
**Paris blue**. **Turnbull's blue** is the same substance, but is made
from different [reagents](/reagent "wikilink"), and its slightly
different color stems from different impurities.

Prussian blue was the first modern synthetic pigment. It is prepared as
a very fine [colloidal dispersion](/colloidal_dispersion "wikilink"),
because the compound is not soluble in water. It contains variable
amounts[1] of other ions and its appearance depends sensitively on the
size of the colloidal particles. The pigment is used in
[paints](/paint "wikilink"), and it is the traditional "blue" in
[blueprints](/blueprint "wikilink") and () [Japanese woodblock
prints](/Japanese_woodblock_print "wikilink").

In medicine, orally administered Prussian blue is used as an
[antidote](/antidote "wikilink") for certain kinds of [heavy metal
poisoning](/heavy_metal_poisoning "wikilink"), e.g., by
[thallium(I)](/thallium(I) "wikilink") and radioactive isotopes of
[caesium](/caesium "wikilink"). The therapy exploits the compound's
ion-exchange properties and high affinity for certain
"[soft](/Lewis_acids_and_bases#Hard_and_soft_classification "wikilink")"
metal cations.

It is on the [World Health Organization's List of Essential
Medicines](/World_Health_Organization's_List_of_Essential_Medicines "wikilink"),
the most important medications needed in a basic [health
system](/health_system "wikilink").[2] Prussian blue lent its name to
[prussic acid](/prussic_acid "wikilink") (hydrogen cyanide) derived from
it. In German, hydrogen cyanide is called ("blue acid"). French chemist
[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac](/Joseph_Louis_Gay-Lussac "wikilink") gave
[cyanide](/cyanide "wikilink") its name, from the [Ancient
Greek](/Ancient_Greek_language "wikilink") word (, "blue"), because of
the color of Prussian blue.

## History

[right\|thumb\|*[The Great Wave off
Kanagawa](The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa "wikilink")* by
[Hokusai](/Hokusai "wikilink"), a famous artwork which makes extensive
use of Prussian blue](/File:Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa2.jpg "wikilink")
Prussian blue pigment is significant since it was the first stable and
relatively [lightfast](/lightfast "wikilink") blue pigment to be widely
used following the loss of knowledge regarding the synthesis of
[Egyptian blue](/Egyptian_blue "wikilink"). European painters had
previously used a number of pigments such as [indigo
dye](/indigo_dye "wikilink"), [smalt](/smalt "wikilink"), and [Tyrian
purple](/Tyrian_purple "wikilink"), which tend to fade, and the
extremely expensive [ultramarine](/ultramarine "wikilink") made from
[lapis lazuli](/lapis_lazuli "wikilink"). [Japanese
painters](/Japanese_painting "wikilink") and [woodblock print
artists](/Woodblock_printing_in_Japan "wikilink"), likewise, did not
have access to a long-lasting blue pigment until they began to import
Prussian blue from Europe.[3]

Prussian blue (also () · *x*) was probably synthesized for the first
time by the paint maker [Diesbach](/Heinrich_Diesbach "wikilink") in
Berlin around 1706.[4] Most historical sources do not mention a first
name of Diesbach. Only Berger refers to him as [Johann Jacob
Diesbach](/Johann_Jacob_Diesbach "wikilink").[5] The pigment is believed
to have been accidentally created when Diesbach used
[potash](/potash "wikilink") tainted with [blood](/blood "wikilink") to
create some red [cochineal](/cochineal "wikilink") dye. The original dye
required potash, [ferric sulfate](/ferric_sulfate "wikilink"), and dried
cochineal. Instead, the blood, potash, and iron sulfate reacted to
create a compound known as [iron
ferrocyanide](/iron_ferrocyanide "wikilink"), which, unlike the desired
red pigment, has a very distinct blue hue.[6] It was named and in 1709
by its first trader.[7]

The pigment replaced the expensive [lapis
lazuli](/lapis_lazuli "wikilink") and was an important topic in the
letters exchanged between [Johann Leonhard
Frisch](/Johann_Leonhard_Frisch "wikilink") and the president of the
[Prussian Academy of
Sciences](/Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences "wikilink"), [Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz](/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "wikilink"), between 1708 and
1716.[8] It is first mentioned in a letter written by Frisch to Leibniz,
from March 31, 1708. Not later than 1708, Frisch began to promote and
sell the pigment across Europe. By August 1709, the pigment had been
termed ; by November 1709, the German name had been used for the first
time by Frisch. Frisch himself is the author of the first known
publication of Prussian blue in the paper in 1710, as can be deduced
from his letters. Diesbach had been working for Frisch since about 1701.

To date, the *Entombment of Christ*, dated 1709 by [Pieter van der
Werff](/Pieter_van_der_Werff "wikilink") (Picture Gallery,
[Sanssouci](/Sanssouci "wikilink"), Potsdam) is the oldest known
painting where Prussian blue was used. Around 1710, painters at the
[Prussian court](/Prussian_court "wikilink") were already using the
pigment. At around the same time, Prussian blue arrived in Paris, where
[Antoine Watteau](/Antoine_Watteau "wikilink") and later his successors
[Nicolas Lancret](/Nicolas_Lancret "wikilink") and [Jean-Baptiste
Pater](/Jean-Baptiste_Pater "wikilink") used it in their
paintings.[9][10]

In 1731, [Georg Ernst Stahl](/Georg_Ernst_Stahl "wikilink") published an
account of the first synthesis of Prussian blue.[11] The story involves
not only Diesbach, but also [Johann Konrad
Dippel](/Johann_Konrad_Dippel "wikilink"). Diesbach was attempting to
create a red [lake pigment](/lake_pigment "wikilink") from
[cochineal](/cochineal "wikilink"), but obtained the blue instead as a
result of the contaminated [potash](/potash "wikilink") he was using. He
borrowed the potash from Dippel, who had used it to produce his "animal
oil". No other known historical source mentions Dippel in this context.
It is, therefore, difficult to judge the reliability of this story
today. In 1724, the recipe was finally published by John
Woodward.[12][13][14]

In 1752, French chemist [Pierre J.
Macquer](/Pierre_J._Macquer "wikilink") made the important step of
showing Prussian blue could be reduced to a salt of iron and a new acid,
which could be used to reconstitute the dye.[15] The new acid, [hydrogen
cyanide](/hydrogen_cyanide "wikilink"), first isolated from Prussian
blue in pure form and characterized in 1782 by Swedish chemist [Carl
Wilhelm Scheele](/Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele "wikilink"),[16] was eventually
given the name (literally "blue acid") because of its derivation from
Prussian blue, and in English became known popularly as Prussic acid.
[Cyanide](/Cyanide "wikilink"), a colorless anion that forms in the
process of making Prussian blue, derives its name from the Greek word
for dark blue.

From the beginning of the 18th century, Prussian blue was the
predominant uniform coat color worn by the infantry and artillery
regiments of the [Prussian Army](/Prussian_Army "wikilink").[17] As
(dark blue), this shade achieved a symbolic importance and continued to
be worn by German soldiers for ceremonial and off-duty occasions until
the outbreak of World War I, when it was superseded by greenish-gray
field gray ().[18]

## Production

Prussian blue is produced by oxidation of ferrous ferrocyanide salts.
These white solids have the formula where = or . The iron in this
material is all ferrous, hence the absence of deep color associated with
the mixed valency. Oxidation of this white solid with hydrogen peroxide
or sodium chlorate produces ferricyanide and affords Prussian blue.[19]

A "soluble" form, , which is really [colloidal](/colloid "wikilink"),
can be made from [potassium
ferrocyanide](/potassium_ferrocyanide "wikilink") and iron(III):


\+  + →

The similar reaction of [potassium
ferricyanide](/potassium_ferricyanide "wikilink") and iron(II) results
in the same colloidal solution, because is converted into ferrocyanide.

"Insoluble" Prussian blue is produced if, in the reactions above, an
excess of is added:


4 + 3 →  [20]

Despite the fact that it is prepared from cyanide salts, Prussian blue
is not toxic because the cyanide groups are tightly bound to iron.[21]
Other polymeric cyanometalates are similarly stable with low toxicity.

### Turnbull's blue

[thumb\|180px\|[Ferricyanide](Ferricyanide "wikilink") ion, used to make
Turnbull's blue](/File:HexacyanidoferratIII_2.svg "wikilink") In former
times, the addition of iron(II) salts to a solution of
[ferricyanide](/ferricyanide "wikilink") was thought to afford a
material different from Prussian blue. The product was traditionally
named Turnbull's blue (TB). [X-ray
diffraction](/X-ray_diffraction "wikilink") and [electron
diffraction](/electron_diffraction "wikilink") methods have shown,
though, that the structures of PB and TB are identical.[22][23] The
differences in the colors for TB and PB reflect subtle differences in
the methods of precipitation, which strongly affect particle size and
impurity content.

## Properties

Prussian blue is a [microcrystalline](/microcrystalline "wikilink") blue
powder. It is insoluble, but the [crystallites](/crystallite "wikilink")
tend to form a [colloid](/colloid "wikilink"). Such colloids can pass
through fine filters.[24] Despite being one of the oldest known
synthetic compounds, the composition of Prussian blue remained uncertain
for many years. Its precise identification was complicated by three
factors:

-   Prussian blue is extremely insoluble, but also tends to form
    colloids
-   Traditional syntheses tend to afford impure compositions
-   Even pure Prussian blue is structurally complex, defying routine
    crystallographic analysis

### Crystal structure

The [chemical formula](/chemical_formula "wikilink") of insoluble
Prussian blue is  · *x*, where *x* = 14–16. The structure was determined
by using [IR spectroscopy](/IR_spectroscopy "wikilink"), [Mössbauer
spectroscopy](/Mössbauer_spectroscopy "wikilink"), [X-ray
crystallography](/X-ray_crystallography "wikilink"), and [neutron
crystallography](/neutron_crystallography "wikilink"). Since X-ray
diffraction cannot easily distinguish carbon from nitrogen in the
presence of heavier elements such as iron, the location of these lighter
elements is deduced by spectroscopic means, as well as by observing the
distances from the iron atom centers.

PB has a [cubic lattice structure](/Cubic_crystal_system "wikilink").
Soluble PB crystals contain interstitial ions; insoluble PB has
interstitial water, instead.
In ideal insoluble PB crystals, the cubic framework is built from
Fe(II)–C–N–Fe(III) sequences, with Fe(II)–carbon distances of 1.92
[Å](/angstrom "wikilink") and Fe(III)–nitrogen distances of 2.03 Å.
One-fourth of the sites of subunits are vacant (empty), leaving three
such groups. The empty nitrogen sites are filled with water molecules,
instead, which are coordinated to Fe(III).

The Fe(II) centers, which are [low spin](/low_spin "wikilink"), are
surrounded by six carbon [ligands](/ligand "wikilink") in an
[octahedral](/octahedral "wikilink") configuration. The Fe(III) centers,
which are [high spin](/high_spin "wikilink"), are octahedrally
surrounded on average by 4.5 nitrogen atoms and 1.5 oxygen atoms (the
oxygen from the six coordinated water molecules). Additional eight
(interstitial) water molecules are present in the unit cell, either as
isolated molecules or [hydrogen bonded](/hydrogen_bond "wikilink") to
the coordinated water.

The composition is notoriously variable due to the presence of lattice
defects, allowing it to be hydrated to various degrees as water
molecules are incorporated into the structure to occupy
[cation](/cation "wikilink") vacancies. The variability of Prussian
blue's composition is attributable to its low
[solubility](/solubility "wikilink"), which leads to its rapid
[precipitation](/precipitation_(chemistry) "wikilink") without the time
to achieve full equilibrium between solid and liquid.[25][26]

### Color

[thumb\|right \| Prussian blue
pigment](/File:Pigment_Berliner_Blau.JPG "wikilink") Prussian blue is
strongly colored and tends towards black and dark blue when mixed into
[oil paints](/oil_paint "wikilink"). The exact hue depends on the method
of preparation, which dictates the particle size. The intense blue color
of Prussian blue is associated with the energy of the transfer of
[electrons](/electron "wikilink") from Fe(II) to Fe(III). Many such
[mixed-valence compounds](/mixed-valence_compound "wikilink") absorb
certain wavelengths of visible light resulting from [intervalence charge
transfer](/intervalence_charge_transfer "wikilink"). In this case,
orange-red light around 680 [nanometers](/nanometer "wikilink") in
wavelength is absorbed, and the reflected light appears blue as a
result.

Like most high-[chroma](/Colorfulness "wikilink")
[pigments](/pigment "wikilink"), Prussian blue cannot be accurately
displayed on a computer display. PB is
[electrochromic](/electrochromism "wikilink")—changing from blue to
colorless upon [reduction](/redox "wikilink"). This change is caused by
reduction of the Fe(III) to Fe(II), eliminating the [intervalence charge
transfer](/intervalence_charge_transfer "wikilink") that causes Prussian
blue's color.

## Use

### Pigment

[thumb \| right \|[Vincent van Gogh](Vincent_van_Gogh "wikilink")'s
*[Starry Night](/Starry_Night "wikilink")* uses Prussian and [cerulean
blue](/cerulean_blue "wikilink")
pigments](/File:Vincent_van_Gogh_Starry_Night.jpg "wikilink") Because it
is easily made, cheap, nontoxic, and intensely colored, Prussian blue
has attracted many applications. It was adopted as a pigment very soon
after its invention and was almost immediately widely used in oil,
watercolor, and dyeing.[27] The dominant uses are for pigments: about
12,000 [tonnes](/tonne "wikilink") of Prussian blue are produced
annually for use in black and bluish [inks](/ink "wikilink"). A variety
of other pigments also contain the material.[28] [Engineer's
blue](/Engineer's_blue "wikilink") and the pigment formed on
[cyanotypes](/cyanotype "wikilink")—giving them their common name
[blueprints](/blueprint "wikilink"). Certain
[crayons](/crayon "wikilink") were once colored with Prussian blue
(later relabeled [midnight
blue](/Midnight_blue#Dark_midnight_blue "wikilink")). It is also a
popular pigment in paints. Similarly, Prussian blue is the basis for
[laundry bluing](/laundry_bluing "wikilink").

In the late 1800s, [Rabbi](/Rabbi "wikilink") [Gershon Henoch
Leiner](/Gershon_Henoch_Leiner "wikilink"), the
[Hasidic](/Hasidic_Judaism "wikilink") [Rebbe](/Rebbe "wikilink") of
[Radzin](/Izhbitza_-_Radzin_(Hasidic_dynasty) "wikilink"),
[dyed](/dyeing "wikilink") [techeiles](/Tekhelet "wikilink") with
prussian blue. Even though some have questioned its identity as
techeiles because of its artificial production, and had Rabbi Leiner
been aware of this he would have retracted from his position that his
dye was techeiles,[29] others have disputed this and claimed that Rabbi
Leiner would not have retracted.[30]

Nanoparticles of prussian blue are used as pigments in some cosmetics
ingredients according to the [European Union Observatory for
Nanomaterials](https://euon.echa.europa.eu/catalogue-of-cosmetic-ingredients).

### Medicine

Prussian blue's ability to incorporate
[monovalent](/Valence_(chemistry) "wikilink") metallic
[cations](/cation "wikilink") (Me<sup>+</sup>) makes it useful as a
[sequestering agent](/Chelation "wikilink") for certain [toxic heavy
metals](/toxic_heavy_metal "wikilink"). Pharmaceutical-grade Prussian
blue in particular is used for people who have ingested
[thallium](/thallium "wikilink") (Tl<sup>+</sup>) or
[radioactive](/radioactive_decay "wikilink")
[caesium](/caesium "wikilink") (<sup>134</sup>Cs<sup>+</sup>,
<sup>137</sup>Cs<sup>+</sup>) . According to the [International Atomic
Energy Agency](/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency "wikilink"), an adult
male can eat at least 10 g of Prussian blue per day without serious
harm. The [U.S. Food and Drug
Administration](/U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration "wikilink") has
determined the "500-mg Prussian blue capsules, when manufactured under
the conditions of an approved New Drug Application, can be found safe
and effective therapy" in certain poisoning cases.[31] Radiogardase
(Prussian blue in soluble capsules [32]) is a commercial product for the
removal of [caesium-137](/caesium-137 "wikilink") from the
[intestine](/intestine "wikilink"), so indirectly from the
[bloodstream](/Circulatory_system "wikilink") by intervening in the
[enterohepatic circulation](/enterohepatic_circulation "wikilink") of
caesium-137,[33] reducing the internal residency time (and exposure) by
about two-thirds. In particular, it was used to absorb from those
poisoned in the [Goiânia accident](/Goiânia_accident "wikilink").[34]

### Stain for iron

[thumb\|Prussian blue
stain](/File:Intra-alveolar_hemosiderin_deposition_-_Prussian_blue_stain.jpg "wikilink")
Prussian blue is a common [histopathology](/histopathology "wikilink")
stain used by [pathologists](/pathologist "wikilink") to detect the
presence of iron in [biopsy](/biopsy "wikilink") specimens, such as in
[bone marrow](/bone_marrow "wikilink") samples. The original stain
formula, known historically (1867) as "[Perls' Prussian
blue](/Perls'_Prussian_blue "wikilink")" after its inventor, German
pathologist [Max Perls](/Max_Perls "wikilink") (1843–1881), used
separate solutions of [potassium
ferrocyanide](/potassium_ferrocyanide "wikilink") and acid to stain
[tissue](/Tissue_(biology) "wikilink") (these are now used combined,
just before staining). Iron deposits in tissue then form the purple
Prussian blue dye in place, and are visualized as blue or purple
deposits.[35] The formula is also known as [Perls' Prussian
blue](/Perls'_Prussian_blue "wikilink") and (incorrectly) as Perl's
Prussian blue.

### By machinists and toolmakers

[Engineer's blue](/Engineer's_blue "wikilink"), Prussian blue in an oily
base, is the traditional material used for spotting metal surfaces such
as [surface plates](/surface_plate "wikilink") and
[bearings](/journal_bearing "wikilink") for [hand
scraping](/hand_scraper "wikilink"). A thin layer of nondrying paste is
applied to a reference surface and transfers to the high spots of the
workpiece. The toolmaker then scrapes, stones, or otherwise removes the
marked high spots. Prussian blue is preferable because it will not
abrade the extremely precise reference surfaces as many ground pigments
may.

### In analytical chemistry

Prussian blue is formed in the Prussian blue assay for total
[phenols](/phenols "wikilink"). Samples and phenolic standards are given
acidic ferric chloride and ferricyanide, which is reduced to
ferrocyanide by the phenols. The ferric chloride and ferrocyanide react
to form Prussian blue. Comparing the absorbance at 700 nm of the samples
to the standards allows for the determination of total phenols or
[polyphenols](/polyphenol "wikilink").[36][37]

### Household use

Prussian blue is present in some preparations of [laundry
bluing](/laundry_bluing "wikilink"), such as [Mrs. Stewart's
Bluing](/Mrs._Stewart's_Bluing "wikilink").[38]
