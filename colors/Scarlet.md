**Scarlet** is a brilliant red color,[1][2] sometimes with a slightly
orange tinge.[3] In the spectrum of visible light, and on the
traditional [color wheel](/color_wheel "wikilink"), it is one-quarter of
the way between red and orange, slightly less orange than
[vermilion](/vermilion "wikilink").[4]

According to surveys in [Europe](/Europe "wikilink") and the [United
States](/United_States "wikilink"), scarlet and other bright shades of
red are the colors most associated with courage, force, passion, heat,
and joy.[5] In the [Roman Catholic
Church](/Roman_Catholic_Church "wikilink"), scarlet is the color worn by
a [cardinal](/Cardinal_(Catholicism) "wikilink"), and is associated with
the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs, and with sacrifice.

Scarlet is also often associated with immorality and
[sin](/sin "wikilink"), particularly
[prostitution](/prostitution "wikilink") or
[adultery](/adultery "wikilink"), largely because of a passage referring
to "[The Great Harlot](/Whore_of_Babylon "wikilink")", "dressed in
[purple](/purple "wikilink") and scarlet", in the
[Bible](/Bible "wikilink") ([Revelation](/Book_of_Revelation "wikilink")
17:1–6).[6]

## Etymology

The word comes from the Middle English "scarlat", from the Old French
escarlate, from the Latin "scarlatum", from the
[Persian](/Persian_language "wikilink") *saqerlât*. The term
[scarlet](/scarlet_(cloth) "wikilink") was also used in the Middle Ages
for a type of cloth that was often bright red.[7] An early recorded use
of *scarlet* as a color name in the [English
language](/English_language "wikilink") dates to 1250.[8]

## History

### Ancient world

Scarlet has been a color of power, wealth and luxury since ancient
times. Scarlet dyes were first mentioned in 8th century BC, under the
name [Armenian Red](/Armenian_cochineal "wikilink"), and they were
described in Persian and Assyrian writings. The color was exported from
Persia to Rome. During the [Roman Empire](/Roman_Empire "wikilink"), it
was second in prestige only to the purple worn by the Emperors. Roman
officers wore scarlet cloaks called *paludamenta*,[9] and persons of
high rank were referred to as the *coccinati*, the people of red.[10]

The color is also mentioned several times in the Bible, both in the Old
and New Testament; in the Latin Vulgate version of the book of Isaiah
(1:18) it says, "If your sins be as scarlet (*si fuerint peccata vestra
ut coccinum*) they shall be made white as snow", and in the book of
[Revelation](/Book_of_Revelation "wikilink") (17:1-6) it describes the
"Great Harlot" (*meretricius magnus*) dressed in scarlet and purple
(*circumdata purpura et coccino*), and riding upon a scarlet beast
(*besteam coccineam*).

The Latin term for scarlet used in the Bible comes from *coccus*, a
"tiny grain". The finest scarlets in ancient times were made from the
tiny [scale insect](/scale_insect "wikilink") called
[kermes](/Kermes_(insect) "wikilink"), which fed on certain oak trees in
Turkey, Persia, Armenia and other parts of the Middle East. The insects
contained a very strong natural dye, also called kermes, which produced
the scarlet color. The insects were so small they were historically
thought to be a kind of grain. This was the origin of the expression
"dyed in the grain."[11]

### Middle Ages and Renaissance

The early Christian church adopted many of the symbols of the Roman
Empire, including the importance of the color scarlet. The flag of the
Crusaders was a scarlet cross on a white background, with scarlet
indicating blood and sacrifice. By a church edict in 1295, Cardinals of
the church, second in authority to the Pope, wore red robes, but a red
closer in color to the purple of the Byzantine Emperors, a color coming
from [murex](/murex "wikilink"), a type of mollusk. After the fall of
Constantinople to the Turks in 1453, however, the imperial purple was no
longer available, and Cardinals began instead to wear scarlet made from
kermes.[12]

During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, scarlet was the color worn by
Kings, princes and the wealthy, partly because of its color and partly
because of its high price. The exact shade, which varied widely, was not
as important as the brilliance and richness of the color. The finest
scarlet, called *scarlatto* or Venetian scarlet, came from Venice, where
it was made from kermes by a specific guild which closely guarded the
formula. Cloth dyed scarlet cost as much as ten times more cloth dyed
with blue.[13]

Berry](/Les_Tres_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry "wikilink") (1412-1416).
<File:Whore> of Babylon (XIV).jpg\|In the Middle Ages, scarlet also
symbolized sin. The [Whore of Babylon](/Whore_of_Babylon "wikilink"),

### 16th to 19th century

In the *Assumption*, by [Titian](/Titian "wikilink") (1516-1518), the
figures of God, the Virgin Mary and two apostles are highlighted by
their scarlet costumes, painted with [vermilion](/vermilion "wikilink")
pigment from Venice. The young Queen [Elizabeth
I](/Elizabeth_I "wikilink") (here in about 1563) liked to wear bright
reds, before she adopted the more sober image of the Virgin Queen. Her
satin gown was probably dyed with [kermes](/kermes_(dye) "wikilink"). In
the 16th century, an even more vivid scarlet began to arrive in Europe
from the New World. When the Spanish
[conquistadores](/conquistadores "wikilink") conquered Mexico, they
found that the [Aztecs](/Aztecs "wikilink") were making brilliant reds
from another variety of scale insect called
[cochineal](/cochineal "wikilink"), similar to the European kermes
vermiilo, but producing a better red at a lower cost. The first
shipments were sent from Mexico to Seville in 1523. The Venetian guilds
at first tried to block the use of the cochineal in Europe, but before
the century was over, it was being used to make scarlet dye in Spain,
France, Italy, and Holland, and almost all the fine scarlet garments of
Europe were made with cochineal.[14]

Scarlet was the traditional color of the British nobility in the 17th
and 18th century. The members of the [House of
Lords](/House_of_Lords "wikilink") wore red ceremonial gowns for the
opening of Parliament, and today sit on red benches.

The red military uniform was adopted by the [British
Army](/British_Army "wikilink") in 1645, and was still worn as a dress
uniform until the outbreak of the [First World
War](/First_World_War "wikilink") in August 1914. Ordinary soldiers wore
red coats dyed with [madder](/Rubia "wikilink"), while officers wore
scarlet coats dyed with the more expensive
[cochineal](/cochineal "wikilink").[15] This led to British soldiers
being known as [red coats](/Red_coat_(British_army) "wikilink").

### 20th and 21st century

From the 8th century until the early 20th century, the most important
scarlet pigment used in western art was
[vermilion](/vermilion "wikilink"), made from the mineral
[cinnabar](/cinnabar "wikilink"). It was used, along with red lake
pigments, by artists from [Botticelli](/Botticelli "wikilink") and
[Raphael](/Raphael "wikilink") to [Renoir](/Renoir "wikilink"). However,
in 1919 commercial production began of an intense new synthetic pigment,
[cadmium red](/cadmium_red "wikilink"). made from [cadmium
sulfide](/cadmium_sulfide "wikilink") and
[selenium](/selenium "wikilink"). The new pigment became the standard
red of [Henri Matisse](/Henri_Matisse "wikilink") and the other
important painters of the 20th century.

In the 20th century, scarlet also became associated with Revolution. Red
flags had first been used as revolutionary emblems, symbolizing the
blood of martyrs, during the [French
Revolution](/French_Revolution "wikilink") and Paris uprisings in 1848.
Red became the color of [socialism](/socialism "wikilink"), then
[communism](/communism "wikilink"), and became the color of the flags of
both the [Soviet Union](/Soviet_Union "wikilink") and Communist
[China](/China "wikilink"). China still uses a scarlet flag; in Chinese
culture red is also the color of happiness. Since the fall of the Soviet
Union The [flag of Russia](/flag_of_Russia "wikilink") is red, blue and
white, the colors of the historic Russian flag from the time of [Peter
the Great](/Peter_the_Great "wikilink"), adapted by him from the colors
of the Dutch flag.

<File:PigmentRed108.jpg%7CIn> the early 20th century, the vivid
synthetic scarlet pigment [cadmium red](/cadmium_red "wikilink") became
the standard red of [Henri Matisse](/Henri_Matisse "wikilink") and other
western artists. <File:Garde> nationale mobile pendant les Journées de

## Scarlet in culture

### Academic dress

[thumb\|right\|100px\|Traditional academic dress of a PhD candidate
receiving his degree at [McGill
University](McGill_University "wikilink")](/File:Scarlet_22.JPG "wikilink")
Scarlet is the color worn in traditional [academic
dress](/academic_dress "wikilink") in the United Kingdom for those
awarded [doctorates](/doctorate "wikilink"). It is also the color of
many of the [undergraduate gowns worn by students of the ancient
universities of Scotland](/undergraduate_gowns_in_Scotland "wikilink").

In academic dress in the United States, scarlet is used for hood
bindings (borders) and, depending on the university or school, other
parts of the dress (velvet chevrons, facings, etc.) to denote a degree
in some form or branch of Theology (e.g., Sacred Theology, Canon Law,
Divinity, Ministry).

In the [French](/France "wikilink") [academic dress
system](/academic_dress "wikilink"), the five traditional fields of
study (Arts, Science, Medicine, Law and Divinity) are each symbolized by
a distinctive color, which appears in the [academic
dress](/academic_dress "wikilink") of the people who graduated in this
field. Scarlet is the distinctive color for Law. As such, it is also the
color worn on their court dress by French high magistrates.

### Film and television

-   *[Captain Scarlet and the
    Mysterons](/Captain_Scarlet_and_the_Mysterons "wikilink")* was a
    British 1960s science-fiction marionette TV series. The captains are

    Grey.
-   *[The Scarlet Pumpernickel](/The_Scarlet_Pumpernickel "wikilink")*
    is a 1950 *[Looney Tunes](/Looney_Tunes "wikilink")* short starring
    [Daffy Duck](/Daffy_Duck "wikilink"), a parody of *The Scarlet
    Pimpernel*.

### Literature

[thumb\|right\|100px\|*A [Study in

-   The novel *[The Scarlet Letter](/The_Scarlet_Letter "wikilink")* by
    19th-century [American](/United_States "wikilink") writer [Nathaniel
    Hawthorne](/Nathaniel_Hawthorne "wikilink") depicts the life of the
    [fictional character](/fictional_character "wikilink") [Hester
    Prynne](/Hester_Prynne "wikilink"), who wears a prominent scarlet
    letter "[A](/A "wikilink")" (for "adulteress") on her chest as a
    punishment for [adultery](/adultery "wikilink").

    detective-mystery novel by Sir [Arthur Conan
    Doyle](/Arthur_Conan_Doyle "wikilink"), introducing and featuring
    [Sherlock Holmes](/Sherlock_Holmes "wikilink"), solving a baffling
    mystery whose main clue was a message painted on a wall in blood.
-   *[The Scarlet Pimpernel](/The_Scarlet_Pimpernel "wikilink")* was a
    popular play and novel about intrigue and adventure during the

    first staged in London in 1903, about an English lord, Sir Percy
    Blakely (Blakeney), who wore a disguise and rescued French nobles
    from the guillotine during the French Revolution. He was supported
    by a secret club, the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and left the
    red flower of that name as his calling card. The Baroness later
    converted her play into a highly successful novel, upon which
    several movies were based. The hero, who lived a double life as a
    foppish British aristicrat by day and a disguised fighter for
    justice by night, inspired later heroes such as
    [Batman](/Batman "wikilink") and [Superman](/Superman "wikilink").

### Religion

[thumb\|right\|150px\|Cardinal Théodore Adrien Sarr, Archbishop of
[Dakar](Dakar "wikilink"),
[Senegal](/Senegal "wikilink")](/File:Cardinal_Théodore_Adrien_Sarr_2.JPG "wikilink")
In the [Roman Catholic Church](/Roman_Catholic_Church "wikilink"),
scarlet robes — symbolizing the color of the blood of Christ and the
Christian martyrs — are worn by
[cardinals](/Cardinal_(Catholicism) "wikilink") as a symbol of their
willingness to defend their faith with their own blood. In the
[Lutheran](/Lutheran "wikilink") tradition, scarlet is the color for
paraments for Palm or Passion Sunday, and for all of Holy Week through
Maundy Thursday.[18]

### Prostitution

In countries that have traditionally been dominated by Christian ideas,
scarlet is associated with prostitution. The [Book of
Revelation](/Revelation "wikilink") refers to the [Whore of
Babylon](/Whore_of_Babylon "wikilink") riding upon a "scarlet beast" and
dressed in [purple](/purple "wikilink") and scarlet.[19] The phrase
*Great Scarlet Whore* has been used by [Puritans](/Puritans "wikilink")
in the 17th century, and the phrase *The Scarlet Woman* was used by many
[Protestants](/Protestants "wikilink") and later
[Mormons](/Mormons "wikilink") in [North
America](/North_America "wikilink") well into the 20th
century.[20][21][22] Scarlet and crimson are also linked to the
Judeo-Christian concept of [sin](/sin "wikilink") in the [book of
Isaiah](/book_of_Isaiah "wikilink"), rendered in the King James Version
"though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though
they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool."[23]

The connection of red or scarlet with prostitution was very common in
Europe and America. Prostitutes were obliged to wear red in some
European cities, and even today areas in European cities where
prostitutes can work legally are known as [red-light
districts](/red-light_districts "wikilink"). Sex worker advocacy groups
like the [Scarlet Alliance](/Scarlet_Alliance "wikilink") use the
striking colour to associate themselves with prostitution.

## Variations of scarlet

### Websafe scarlet

This is a variation on the standard RGB or Hex combination that produces
a truer Scarlet color on some monitors. It is slightly more orange than
the standard Scarlet RGB value of 255, 36, 0, but does give a truer
color on displays where the red dominates over the orange and would
otherwise make the color appear more as a normal red rather than a
genuine Scarlet.

### Torch red

This is the color now called *scarlet* in [Crayola](/Crayola "wikilink")
[crayons](/crayon "wikilink"). It was originally formulated as **torch
red** in 1998 and then renamed *scarlet* by Crayola in 2000.
