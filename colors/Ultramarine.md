[pigment](pigment "wikilink")](/File:Ultramarinepigment.jpg "wikilink")

**Ultramarine** is a deep [blue](/blue "wikilink")
[color](/color "wikilink") [pigment](/pigment "wikilink") which was
originally made by grinding [lapis lazuli](/lapis_lazuli "wikilink")
into a [powder](/powder "wikilink").[1] The name comes from the
[Latin](/Latin "wikilink") *ultramarinus*, literally "beyond the sea",
because the pigment was imported into [Europe](/Europe "wikilink") from
mines in [Afghanistan](/Afghanistan "wikilink") by
[Italian](/Italians "wikilink") traders during the
[14th](/14th_century "wikilink") and [15th
centuries](/15th_century "wikilink").[2]

Ultramarine was the finest and most expensive blue used by
[Renaissance](/Renaissance "wikilink") painters. It was often used for
the robes of the [Virgin Mary](/Virgin_Mary "wikilink"), and symbolized
holiness and humility. It remained an extremely expensive pigment until
a synthetic ultramarine was invented in 1826.

## Chemistry

The pigment consists primarily of a [zeolite](/zeolite "wikilink")-based
mineral containing small amounts of
[polysulfides](/polysulfide "wikilink"). It occurs in nature as a
proximate component of [lapis lazuli](/lapis_lazuli "wikilink")
containing a blue cubic mineral called [lazurite](/lazurite "wikilink").
In the [Colour Index
International](/Colour_Index_International "wikilink"), the pigment of
ultramarine is identified as P. Blue 29 77007.[3] The major component of
lazurite is a complex sulfur-containing sodium-silicate
(Na<sub>8–10</sub>Al<sub>6</sub>Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>24</sub>S<sub>2–4</sub>),
which makes ultramarine the most complex of all mineral
[pigments](/pigment "wikilink").[4] Some
[chloride](/chloride "wikilink") is often present in the crystal lattice
as well. The blue color of the pigment is due to the [](/S3- "wikilink")
[radical](/radical_(chemistry) "wikilink") [anion](/anion "wikilink"),
which contains an [unpaired electron](/unpaired_electron "wikilink").[5]

## Production

The raw materials used in the manufacture of synthetic ultramarine are
the following:

-   white [kaolin](/kaolin "wikilink"),
-   [anhydrous](/anhydrous "wikilink") [sodium
    sulfate](/sodium_sulfate "wikilink") (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>),
-   anhydrous [sodium carbonate](/sodium_carbonate "wikilink")
    (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>),
-   powdered [sulfur](/sulfur "wikilink"),
-   powdered [charcoal](/charcoal "wikilink") or relatively ash-free
    [coal](/coal "wikilink"), or [colophony](/colophony "wikilink") in
    lumps.[6]

The preparation is typically made in steps:

-   The first part of the process takes place at 700 to 750 °C in a
    closed furnace, so that sulfur, carbon and organic substances give
    reducing conditions. This yields a yellow-green product sometimes
    used as a pigment.
-   In the second step, air or sulfur dioxide at 350 to 450 °C is used
    to oxidise sulfide in the intermediate product to S<sub>2</sub> and
    S<sub>*n*</sub> [chromophore](/chromophore "wikilink") molecules,
    resulting in the blue (or purple, pink or red) pigment.[7]
-   The mixture is heated in a kiln, sometimes in brick-sized amounts.
-   The resultant solids are then ground and washed, as is the case in
    any other insoluble pigment's manufacturing process; the chemical
    reaction produces large amounts of [sulfur
    dioxide](/sulfur_dioxide "wikilink"). ([Flue-gas
    desulfurization](/Flue-gas_desulfurization "wikilink") is thus
    essential to its manufacture where SO<sub>2</sub> pollution is
    regulated.)

"Ultramarine poor in silica" is obtained by fusing a mixture of soft
clay, sodium sulfate, charcoal, sodium carbonate and sulfur. The product
is at first white, but soon turns green "green ultramarine" when it is
mixed with sulfur and heated. The sulfur burns, and a fine blue pigment
is obtained. "Ultramarine rich in silica" is generally obtained by
heating a mixture of pure clay, very fine white
[sand](/sand "wikilink"), sulfur and charcoal in a [muffle
furnace](/muffle_furnace "wikilink"). A blue product is obtained at
once, but a red tinge often results. The different ultramarines—green,
blue, red and violet—are finely ground and washed with water.[8]

Synthetic ultramarine is a more vivid blue than natural ultramarine,
since the particles in synthetic ultramarine are smaller and more
uniform than the particles in natural ultramarine and therefore
[diffuse](/diffusion "wikilink") light more evenly.[9] Its color is
unaffected by light nor by contact with oil or lime as used in painting.
[Hydrochloric acid](/Hydrochloric_acid "wikilink") immediately bleaches
it with liberation of hydrogen sulfide. Even a small addition of [zinc
oxide](/zinc_oxide "wikilink") to the reddish varieties especially
causes a considerable diminution in the intensity of the color.[10]

## Structure and classification of ultramarines

Ultramarine is the aluminosilicate [zeolite](/zeolite "wikilink") with a
[sodalite](/sodalite "wikilink") structure. Sodalite consists of
interconnected aluminosilicate cages. Some of these cages contain
[polysulfide](/polysulfide "wikilink") () groups that are the
chromophore (color centre). The negative charge on these ions is
balanced by ions that also occupy these cages.[11]

The chromophore is proposed to be or S<sub>4</sub>.[12]

## Applications

Synthetic ultramarine, being very cheap, is largely used for wall
painting, the printing of paper hangings and calico, etc., and also as a
corrective for the yellowish tinge often present in things meant to be
white, such as [linen](/linen "wikilink"), [paper](/paper "wikilink"),
etc. [Bluing](/Bluing_(fabric) "wikilink") or "Laundry blue" is a
suspension of synthetic ultramarine (or the chemically different
[prussian blue](/prussian_blue "wikilink")) that is used for this
purpose when washing white clothes. Also often found in make up such as
[mascaras](/mascara "wikilink") or eye shadows. Large quantities are
used in the manufacture of paper, and especially for producing a kind of
pale blue writing paper which was popular in
[Britain](/United_Kingdom "wikilink").[13] During World War I, the
[RAF](/Royal_Air_Force "wikilink") painted the outer
[roundels](/roundel "wikilink") with a color made from Ultramarine Blue.
This became BS 108(381C) Aircraft Blue. It was replaced in the 1960s by
a new color made on [Phthalocyanine
Blue](/Phthalocyanine_Blue "wikilink"), BS110(381C) Roundel Blue.

## History

The name derives from Middle [Latin](/Latin "wikilink") *ultramarinus*,
literally "beyond the sea" because it was imported from Asia by sea.[14]
In the past, it has also been known as *azzurrum ultramarine, azzurrum
transmarinum, azzuro oltramarino, azur d'Acre, pierre d'azur,
Lazurstein.* Current terminology for ultramarine includes natural
ultramarine (English), *outremer lapis* (French), *Ultramarin echt*
(German), *oltremare genuino* (Italian), and *ultramarino verdadero*
(Spanish). The first recorded use of *ultramarine* as a color name in
English was in 1598.[15]

The first noted use of *lapis lazuli* as a pigment can be seen in the
6th and 7th-century AD cave paintings in
[Afghanistani](/Afghanistan "wikilink")
[Zoroastrian](/Zoroastrian "wikilink") and
[Buddhist](/Buddhist "wikilink") temples, near the most famous source of
the mineral. *Lapis lazuli* has also been identified in Chinese
paintings from the 10th and 11th centuries, in Indian mural paintings
from the 11th, 12th, and 17th centuries, and on Anglo-Saxon and Norman
illuminated manuscripts from c.1100.

### In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance

<File:The> Wilton Diptych (Right).jpg\|The [Wilton
Diptych](/Wilton_Diptych "wikilink") (1395–1399) is an example of the
use of ultramarine in 14th century England <File:Masaccio> 031.jpg\|The
blue robes of the [Virgin Mary](/Virgin_Mary "wikilink") by
[Masaccio](/Masaccio "wikilink") (1426) were painted with ultramarine.
<File:Pietro> Perugino cat54b.jpg\|[Pietro
Perugino](/Pietro_Perugino "wikilink") economized on this painting of
the Virgin Mary (about 1500) by using [azurite](/azurite "wikilink") for
the underpainting of the robe, then adding a layer of ultramarine on
top. <File:Titian> - Bacchus and Ariadne - Google Art
Project.jpg\|[Titian](/Titian "wikilink") made dramatic use of
ultramarine in the sky and draperies of *Bacchus and Ariadne* (1520–23).

During the [Renaissance](/Renaissance "wikilink"), ultramarine was the
finest and most expensive blue that could be used by painters. The 15th
century artist [Cennino Cennini](/Cennino_Cennini "wikilink") wrote in
his painters' handbook: "Ultramarine blue is a glorious, lovely and
absolutely perfect pigment beyond all the pigments. It would not be
possible to say anything about or do anything to it which would not make
it more so."[16] Natural ultramarine is the most difficult pigment to
grind by hand, and for all except the highest quality of mineral, sheer
grinding and washing produces only a pale grayish blue powder.[17][18]
At the beginning of the 13th century, an improved method came into use,
described by Cennino Cennini in the 15th century. This process consisted
of mixing the ground material with melted [wax](/wax "wikilink"),
[resins](/resin "wikilink"), and [oils](/oil "wikilink"), wrapping the
resulting mass in a cloth, and then kneading it in a dilute
[lye](/lye "wikilink") solution. The blue particles collect at the
bottom of the pot, while the impurities and colorless crystals remain.
This process was performed at least three times, with each successive
extraction generating a lower quality material. The final extraction,
consisting largely of colorless material as well as a few blue
particles, brings forth ultramarine ash which is prized as a
[glaze](/Glaze_(painting_technique) "wikilink") for its pale blue
transparency.[19]

The pigment was most extensively used during the 14th through 15th
centuries, as its brilliance complemented the
[vermilion](/vermilion "wikilink") and [gold](/gold "wikilink") of
illuminated manuscripts and Italian panel paintings. It was valued
chiefly on account of its brilliancy of tone and its inertness in
opposition to sunlight, [oil](/oil "wikilink"), and slaked
[lime](/calcium_oxide "wikilink"). It is, however, extremely susceptible
to even minute and dilute mineral [acids](/acid "wikilink") and acid
vapors. Dilute HCl, HNO<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
rapidly destroy the blue color, producing [hydrogen
sulfide](/hydrogen_sulfide "wikilink") (H<sub>2</sub>S) in the process.
[Acetic acid](/Acetic_acid "wikilink") attacks the pigment at a much
slower rate than mineral acids. Ultramarine was only used for
[frescoes](/fresco "wikilink") when it was applied
"[secco](/fresco-secco "wikilink")" because fresco's absorption rate
made its use cost prohibitive. The pigment was mixed with a binding
medium like egg to form a [tempera](/tempera "wikilink") and applied
over dry plaster (such as [Giotto di
Bondone](/Giotto_di_Bondone "wikilink")'s frescos in the [Cappella degli
Scrovegni](/Cappella_degli_Scrovegni "wikilink") or [Arena
Chapel](/Arena_Chapel "wikilink") in [Padua](/Padua "wikilink")).

European artists used the pigment sparingly, reserving their highest
quality blues for the robes of
[Mary](/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus) "wikilink") and the [Christ
child](/Christ_child "wikilink"). As a result of the high price, artists
sometimes economized by using a cheaper blue,
[azurite](/azurite "wikilink"), for under painting. Most likely imported
to Europe through [Venice](/Venice "wikilink"), the pigment was seldom
seen in German art or art from countries north of Italy. Due to a
shortage of azurite in the late 16th and 17th century, the price for the
already-expensive ultramarine increased dramatically.[20]

### In the 17th and 18th century

[Johannes Vermeer](/Johannes_Vermeer "wikilink") (c. 1675)

The turban of the [Girl with a Pearl
Earring](/Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring "wikilink") by
[Vermeer](/Vermeer "wikilink") is painted with a mixture of ultramarine
and lead white, with a thin glaze of pure ultramarine over it.[22]

In Vermeer's *Lady standing at a virginal*, the ultramarine pigment in
the seat cushion in the foreground has deteriorated and turned paler
with time. [Johannes Vermeer](/Johannes_Vermeer "wikilink") made
extensive use of ultramarine in his paintings. In *Lady standing at a
virginal*, the young woman's dress is painted with a mixture of
ultramarine and green earth, and ultramarine was also used to add
shadows in the flesh tones.[23]

Scientific analysis by the [National
Gallery](/National_Gallery "wikilink") in London of *Lady standing at a
virginal* showed that the ultramarine in the blue seat cushion in the
foreground had degraded and become paler with time; it would have been a
deeper blue when originally painted.[24]

### 19th century – the invention of synthetic ultramarine

The beginning of the development of artificial ultramarine blue was
known from [Goethe](/Goethe "wikilink"). In about 1787, he observed the
blue deposits on the walls of lime kilns near Palermo in Italy. He was
aware of the use of these glassy deposits as a substitute for lapis
lazuli in decorative applications. He did not, however, mention if it
was suitable to grind for a pigment.[25][26]

In 1814, [Tassaert](/Tassaert_family "wikilink") observed the
spontaneous formation of a blue compound, very similar to ultramarine,
if not identical with it, in a [lime](/calcium_oxide "wikilink")
[kiln](/kiln "wikilink") at St. Gobain,[27] which caused the *Societé
pour l'Encouragement d'Industrie* to offer, in 1824, a prize for the
artificial production of the precious color. Processes were devised by
[Jean Baptiste Guimet](/Jean_Baptiste_Guimet "wikilink") (1826) and by
[Christian Gmelin](/Christian_Gmelin "wikilink") (1828), then professor
of chemistry in Tübingen; while Guimet kept his process a secret, Gmelin
published his, and thus became the originator of the "artificial
ultramarine" industry.<ref>See:

## General terminology

Ultramarine is a blue made from natural [lapis
lazuli](/lapis_lazuli "wikilink"), or its synthetic equivalent which is
sometimes called "French Ultramarine".[29] Variants of the pigment
"ultramarine red", "ultramarine green", "ultramarine violet" are known,
and are based on similar chemistry and crystal structure.[30]

More generally "ultramarine blue" can refer to a vivid blue. The term
"ultramarine green" indicates a dark green, [barium
chromate](/barium_chromate "wikilink") is sometimes referred to as
"ultramarine yellow".[31] Ultramarine pigment has also been termed
"Gmelin's blue", "Guimet's blue", "New blue", "Oriental blue" and
"Permanent blue".[32]

paintings of Vermeer

[25] From p. 265: *"Doch wissen sie, außer diesen beiden, … andern
kirchlichen Verzierungen mit Glück angewendet."* (Yet they \[viz, the
stone cutters of Palermo\] know, besides these two \[types of stone\],
still more about a material, a product of the fire of their lime kilns.
In these is found, after roasting \[the lime\], a type of glassy flux,
which passes from the brightest blue color to the darkest, even to the
blackest. These lumps, like other rocks, are cut into thin slabs,
appraised according to the level of their color and purity, and, with
luck, used instead of lapis lazuli in the inlaying of altars, tombs, and
other church decorations.)

[26] From pp. 385–386: *"Allein es scheint weniger bekannt zu sein, …
von Altären u.s.w. gebraucht würde."* (Yet it seems to be less well
known that von Göthe in the year 1787 during his stay in Palermo (see
his *Italian Journey*) cited a similar observation, as he recounted that
in the Sicilian lime ovens, a product of fire, a sort of glassy flux, is
found, \[which is\] of a light blue to dark blue color, \[and\] which
was used as *lapis lazuli* by local artisans during the inlaying of
altars, etc.)
