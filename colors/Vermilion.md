**Vermilion** (sometimes spelled **vermillion**)[1][2] is both a
brilliant [red](/red "wikilink") or
[scarlet](/scarlet_(color) "wikilink") [pigment](/pigment "wikilink"),
originally made from the powdered mineral
[cinnabar](/cinnabar "wikilink"), and the corresponding
[color](/color "wikilink").[3] It was widely used in the art and
decoration of Ancient Rome, in the [illuminated
manuscripts](/illuminated_manuscripts "wikilink") of the Middle Ages, in
the paintings of the [Renaissance](/Renaissance "wikilink"), as
[sindoor](/sindoor "wikilink") in [India](/India "wikilink"), and in the
art and [lacquerware of China](/lacquerware_of_China "wikilink").[4][5]

## Etymology

The word vermilion came from the Old French word *vermeillon*, which was
derived from *vermeil*, from the Latin *vermiculus*, the diminutive of
the Latin word *vermis*, or worm. The name originated because it had a
similar color to the natural red dye made from an insect, the *[Kermes
vermilio](/Kermes_vermilio "wikilink")*, which was widely used in
Europe.[6] The first recorded use of *vermilion* as a color name in
English was in 1289.[7][8] The term cinnabar was used interchangeably
with vermilion until the 17th century, when vermilion became the more
common name. By the late 18th century 'cinnabar' applied to the unground
natural mineral only.

In some [Iberian languages](/Iberian_languages "wikilink") the word for
"red" is also derived from *vermiculus*, making the words for "red" and
"vermillion" doublets. Compare
[Portuguese](/Portuguese_language "wikilink") *vermelho* ("red") and
*vermelhão* ("vermillion").

## Chemistry and manufacture

Vermilion is a dense, opaque pigment with a clear, brilliant hue.[9] The
pigment was originally made by grinding a powder of
[cinnabar](/cinnabar "wikilink") ([mercury
sulfide](/mercury_sulfide "wikilink")).[10] Like most mercury compounds,
it is [toxic](/toxic "wikilink").

Vermilion is not one specific hue; mercuric sulfides make a range of
warm hues, from bright orange-red to a duller reddish-purple that
resembles fresh duck liver. Differences in hue are caused by the size of
the ground particles of pigment. Larger crystals produce duller and
less-orange hue.

Cinnabar pigment was a side-product of the mining of mercury, and mining
cinnabar was difficult, expensive and dangerous, because of the toxicity
of mercury. The Greek philosopher
[Theophrastus](/Theophrastus "wikilink") of Eresus (371–286 BC)
described the process in "De Lapidibus", the first scientific book on
minerals. Efforts began early to find a better way to make the pigment.

The Chinese were probably the first to make a synthetic vermilion as
early as the 4th century BC. The Greek alchemist [Zosimus of
Panopolis](/Zosimus_of_Panopolis "wikilink") (3rd–4th century AD) wrote
that such a method existed. In the early ninth century the process was
accurately described by the Persian alchemist [Jabir ibn
Hayyan](/Jabir_ibn_Hayyan "wikilink") (722–804) in his book of recipes
of colors, and the process began to be widely used in Europe.[11][12]

The process described by Jabir ibn Hayyan was fairly simple. Mercury and
sulfur were mixed together, forming a black compound of sulphide of
mercury, called *Aethiopes mineralis*. This was then heated in a flask.
The compound vaporized, and recondensed in the top of the flask. The
flask was broken, the vermilion was taken out, and it was ground. When
first created the pigment was almost black, but as it was ground the red
color appeared. The longer the color was ground, the finer the color
became. The Italian Renaissance artist [Cennino
Cennini](/Cennino_Cennini "wikilink") wrote: "if you were to grind it
every day even for twenty years it would keep getting better and more
perfect."[13]

During the 17th century a new method of making the pigment was
introduced, known as the 'Dutch' method. Mercury and melted sulfur were
mashed to make black [mercury sulfide](/mercury_sulfide "wikilink"),
then heated in a [retort](/retort "wikilink"), producing vapors
condensing as a bright, red mercury sulfide. To remove the sulfur these
crystals were treated with a strong alkali, washed and finally ground
under water to yield the commercial powder form of pigment.[14] The
pigment is still made today by essentially the same process.

Vermilion has one important defect: it is liable to darken, or develop a
purplish-gray surface sheen.[15] [Cennino
Cennini](/Cennino_Cennini "wikilink") wrote, "Bear in mind ... that it
is not in its character to be exposed to air but it is more resistant on
panel than on walls since, when it is used and laid on a wall, over a
period of time, standing in the air, it turns black."[16] Newer research
indicates that chlorine ions and light may aid in decomposing vermilion
into elemental mercury, which is black in finely dispersed form.[17][18]

Vermilion was the primary red pigment used by European painters from the
Renaissance until the 20th century. However, because of its cost and
toxicity, it was almost entirely replaced by a new synthetic pigment,
[cadmium red](/cadmium_red "wikilink"), in the 20th century.

Genuine vermilion pigment today comes mostly from China; it is a
synthetic mercuric sulfide, labeled on paint tubes as PR-106 (Red
Pigment 106). The synthetic pigment is of higher quality than vermilion
made from ground cinnabar, which has many impurities. The pigment is
very toxic, and should be used with great care.[19]

## History

### Antiquity

The first documented use of vermilion pigment, made with ground
cinnabar, dates to 8000–7000 BC, and was found at the
[neolithic](/neolithic "wikilink") village of
[Catalhoyuk](/Catalhoyuk "wikilink"), in modern-day Turkey. Cinnabar was
mined in Spain beginning in about 5300 BC. In China, the first
documented use of Cinnabar as a pigment was by the [Yangshao
culture](/Yangshao_culture "wikilink") (5000–4000 BC), where it was used
to paint ceramics, to cover the walls and floors of rooms, and for
ritual ceremonies.[21]

The principal source of cinnabar for the ancient Romans was the Almaden
mine in northwest Spain, which was worked by prisoners. Since the ore of
mercury was highly toxic, a term in the mines was a virtual death
sentence. [Pliny the Elder](/Pliny_the_Elder "wikilink") described the
mines this way:

> Nothing is more carefully guarded. It is forbidden to break up or
> refine the cinnabar on the spot. They send it to Rome in its natural
> condition, under seal, to the extent of some ten thousand pounds a
> year. The sales price is fixed by law to keep it from becoming
> impossibly expensive, and the price fixed is seventy sesterces a
> pound.[22]

In Rome, the precious pigment was used to paint frescoes, decorate
statues, and [even as a
cosmetic](/Cosmetics_in_Ancient_Rome#Rouge "wikilink"). In [Roman
triumphs](/Roman_triumphs "wikilink"), the victors had their faces
covered with vermilion powder, and the face of Jupiter on the
[Capitoline Hill](/Capitoline_Hill "wikilink") was also colored
vermilion.[23] Cinnabar was used to paint the walls of some of the most
luxurious villas in [Pompeii](/Pompeii "wikilink"), including the Villa
of the Mysteries ([Italian](/Italian_language "wikilink"): *[Villa dei
Misteri](/Villa_of_the_Mysteries "wikilink")).*[24]
[Pliny](/Pliny_the_Elder "wikilink") reported that the painters of that
villa stole a large portion of the expensive pigment by frequently
washing their brushes and saving the wash water.[25]

In the [Byzantine Empire](/Byzantine_Empire "wikilink"), the use of
cinnabar and the vermilion color was reserved for the use of the
Imperial family and administrators; official letters and imperial
decrees were written in vermilion ink, made with cinnabar.[26]

### In the Americas

Vermilion was also used by the peoples of North and South America, to
paint ceramics, figurines, murals, and for the decoration of burials. It
was used in the Chavin Civilization (400 BC – 200 AD), and in the
[Maya](/Maya_civilization "wikilink"), Sican, Moche, and
[Inca](/Inca "wikilink") Empire. The major source was the Huancavelica
mine in the [Andes](/Andes "wikilink") mountains in central Peru.

The most dramatic example of the use of vermilion in the Americas was
the so-called [Tomb of the Red
Queen](/Tomb_of_the_Red_Queen "wikilink"), located in Temple XIII in the
ruins of the Mayan city of [Palenque](/Palenque "wikilink") in Chiapas,
Mexico, dated to between 600–700 AD, discovered in 1994 by Mexican
archeologist Arnoldo Gonzales Cruz. The body and all the objects in the
sarcophagus were covered with bright red vermilion powder made from
cinnabar.[27]

### In the Middle Ages and Renaissance

The technique for making a synthetic vermilion by combining sulphur and
mercury was in use in Europe in the 9th century, but the pigment was
still expensive. Since it was almost as expensive as gold leaf, it was
used only in the most important decoration of illuminated manuscripts,
while the less expensive [minium](/minium_(pigment) "wikilink"), made
with [red lead](/red_lead "wikilink"), was used for the red letters and
symbols in the text.

Vermilion was also used by painters in the Renaissance as a very vivid
and bright red, though it did have the weakness of sometimes turning
dark with time. The Florentine artist [Cennino
Cennini](/Cennino_D'Andrea_Cennini "wikilink") described it in his
handbook for artists:

By the 20th century, the cost and toxicity of vermilion led to its
gradually being replaced by synthetic pigments, particularly [cadmium
red](/Cadmium_pigments "wikilink"), which had a comparable color and
opacity.

and humans. (Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, Ankara) <File:Banpo>

Mysteries](/Villa_of_the_Mysteries "wikilink") in
[Pompeii](/Pompeii "wikilink") was a showcase for the expensive
vermilion pigment made from ground cinnabar.
<File:Palenque-ausgrab.jpg%7CThe> walls of the tombs of
[Maya](/Maya_civilization "wikilink") rulers were sometimes painted with
cinnabar, and in the [Tomb of the Red
Queen](/Tomb_of_the_Red_Queen "wikilink") in
[Palenque](/Palenque "wikilink") (600–700 AD), the remains of a
noblewoman were covered with bright vermilion cinnabar powder.

### Chinese red

In China, the color vermilion was also playing an important role in
national culture. The color was mostly used in creating Chinese
[lacquerware](/lacquerware "wikilink"), which was exported around the
world, giving rise to the term "Chinese red".

The lacquer came from the [Chinese lacquer
tree](/Toxicodendron_vernicifluum "wikilink"), or *[Toxicodendron
vernicifluum](/Toxicodendron_vernicifluum "wikilink")*, a relative of
the [sumac](/sumac "wikilink") tree, which grew in regions of China,
Korea and Japan. The sap or resin of the tree, called
[urushiol](/urushiol "wikilink"), was caustic and toxic (it contained
the same chemical compound as [poison ivy](/poison_ivy "wikilink")) but,
painted on to wood or metal, it hardened into a fine natural plastic, or
lacquer surface. The pure sap was dark brown, but beginning in about the
3rd century BC, during the [Han Dynasty](/Han_dynasty "wikilink"),
Chinese artisans colored it with powdered cinnabar or with [red
ochre](/Ochre "wikilink") ([ferric oxide](/ferric_oxide "wikilink")),
giving it an orange-red color.[28][29] Beginning in about the 8th
century, Chinese chemists began making synthetic vermilion from mercury
and sulfur, which reduced the price of the pigment and allowed the
production of Chinese lacquerware on a larger scale.

The shade of red of the lacquerware has changed over the centuries.
During the Eastern [Han Dynasty](/Han_Dynasty "wikilink") (25–220 AD)
the Chinese word for red referred to a light red. However, during the
[Tang Dynasty](/Tang_dynasty "wikilink") (618–907), when the synthetic
vermilion was introduced, that color became darker and richer. The poet
[Bai Juyi](/Bai_Juyi "wikilink") (772–846) wrote that "the flowers in
the river when the sun rises are redder than flames", and the word he
used for red was the word for vermilion, or Chinese red.[30]

When Chinese lacquerware and the ground cinnabar used to color it were
exported to Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, European collectors
considered it to be finer than the European vermilion. In 1835 "Chinese
vermilion" was described as a cinnabar so pure that it only had to be
ground into powder to become a perfect vermilion. Historically European
vermilion often included adulterants including brick,
[orpiment](/orpiment "wikilink"), [iron oxide](/iron_oxide "wikilink"),
[Persian red](/Persian_red "wikilink"), [iodine
scarlet](/Mercury(II)_iodide "wikilink")—and
[minium](/minium_(pigment) "wikilink") (*red lead*), an inexpensive and
bright but [fugitive](/fugitive_pigment "wikilink") lead-oxide
pigment.[31]

Since ancient times, vermilion was regarded as the color of blood, and
thus the color of life. It was used to paint temples, the carriages of
the Emperor, and as the printing paste for personal
[seals](/Seal_(East_Asia) "wikilink"). It was also used for unique red
calligraphic ink reserved for Emperors. Chinese Taoists associated
vermilion with eternity.

    vermilion. This temple was featured in the
    [West](/Western_world "wikilink") by the 1972–1975 [TV
    series](/TV_series "wikilink") *[Kung
    Fu](/Kung_Fu_(TV_series) "wikilink")*.
-   In the [Bible](/Bible "wikilink") vermilion is listed as a pigment
    that was in use for painting buildings during the reign of Shallum
    the son of Josiah king of [Judah](/Kingdom_of_Judah "wikilink") and
    is named in the book of the prophet [Ezekiel](/Ezekiel "wikilink")
    as a pigment used in art that portrayed
    [Chaldean](/Chaldea "wikilink") men. (Jeremiah 22:11–14, Ezekiel
    23:14–17)
-   The Vermilion rose is a symbol of the [Blessed Virgin
    Mary](/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus "wikilink").

### Mythology

-   In Han China's [Five Elements](/Wu_Xing "wikilink") cosmology (cf.
    [Chinese mythology](/Chinese_mythology "wikilink")), one of the
    [four symbols](/Four_Symbols_(Chinese_constellation) "wikilink") of
    the four directions is a bird called [Vermilion
    Bird](/Vermilion_Bird "wikilink"), which represents the direction of
    [south](/south "wikilink"). The color red (particularly as
    exemplified by cinnabar/vermilion) was also symbolically associated
    with summer, fire, a certain note on the musical scale, a certain
    day of the calendar, and so on.[33]

### Literature
