## Early life

Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar was born on October 11, 1992, in [Washington
Heights](/Washington_Heights,_Manhattan "wikilink"),
[Manhattan](/Manhattan "wikilink"). She is the daughter of a
[Dominican](/People_of_Dominican_Republic "wikilink") father and
[Trinidadian](/Trinidadians_and_Tobagonians "wikilink") and
[Spanish](/Spaniards "wikilink") mother.[3][4][5] She was raised in the
[Highbridge](/Highbridge,_Bronx "wikilink") neighborhood of the [South
Bronx](/South_Bronx "wikilink"),[6][7][8][9] and spent much time at her
paternal grandmother's home in Washington Heights, which she credits
with giving her "such a thick accent."[10] Almánzar developed the stage
name "Cardi B" as a derivation of [Bacardi](/Bacardi "wikilink"), a
[rum](/rum "wikilink") brand that was formerly her nickname.[11] Cardi B
has said she was a gang member of the
[Bloods](/United_Blood_Nation "wikilink") in her youth, since the age of
16.[12][13] However, she has stated ever since that she would not
encourage joining a gang.[14] She went on to attend Renaissance High
School for Musical Theater & Technology, a [vocational high
school](/vocational_high_school "wikilink") on the [Herbert H. Lehman
High School](/Herbert_H._Lehman_High_School "wikilink") campus.[15][16]

During her teenage years, Cardi B was employed at an Amish Market in
Tribeca.[17] She then began stripping at the age of 19.[18][19] Upon
being fired from the supermarket, her former manager recommended she
work at a strip club. Cardi B has said that becoming a
[stripper](/stripper "wikilink") was positive for her life in many ways:
"It really saved me from a lot of things. When I started stripping I
went back to school."[20][21][22] She has explained that she became a
stripper in order to escape [poverty](/poverty "wikilink") and [domestic
violence](/domestic_violence "wikilink"), having been in an [abusive
relationship](/Relational_aggression "wikilink") at the time after being
kicked out her mothers house,[23][24][25] and that stripping was her
only way to earn enough money to escape her dire situation and get an
education.[26] She attended [Borough of Manhattan Community
College](/Borough_of_Manhattan_Community_College "wikilink")[27] before
eventually [dropping out](/dropping_out "wikilink").[28] While
stripping, Cardi B lied to her mother by telling her she was making
money babysitting.[29]

In 2013, Cardi B began to gain publicity due to several of her videos
spreading [virally](/viral_video "wikilink") on social media, on
[Vine](/Vine_(service) "wikilink") and her official
[Instagram](/Instagram "wikilink") page.[30]

bottoms](/Christian_Louboutin "wikilink"), a lot of girls they cannot

[225] Shamsian, Jacob; and Singh, Olivia. ["The fabulous life of Cardi
B, from stripper to chart-topping
rapper"](https://www.insider.com/who-is-cardi-b-bodak-yellow-2017-9),
Insider, January 14, 2019. Accessed August 12, 2019. "Her distinctive
New Yawk accent makes her an important part of the city's constellation
of hip-hop artists. But she prefers to live in Edgewater, New Jersey,
and commute to New York City."

[226] Kameir, Rawiya. ["Cardi B Did It Her Way; Cardi B engineered
Instagram fame into reality TV stardom into a poppin’ rap career. Now
she’s learning to juggle everything that comes with
it."](http://www.thefader.com/2017/06/22/cardi-b-cover-story-interview),
*[The Fader](/The_Fader "wikilink")*, June 22, 2017. Accessed August 12,
2019. "To put it in her own indelicate words, Cardi B really has to take
a shit. She’s curled up in the backseat of a black Denali that has been
tasked with delivering us over the Hudson River, from midtown Manhattan
to her apartment in Edgewater, New Jersey.... In the apartment, for
which she pays $3,000 a month, there’s a large, open-plan area for
living, dining, and cooking, plus three rooms and two bathrooms. In the
master bedroom, there’s a plush, round, red bed that she calls 'the
lovers' bed,' giggling MTV Cribs-style and jumping on it to twerk."
