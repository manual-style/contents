Being chic is as much about attitude and developing your own style as it
is about being trendy. In fact, being chic often means picking
sophisticated clothing that never goes out of fashion, rather than
keeping up with the latest trends. Define your style, then find
comfortable clothing that fits into your personal aesthetic. Once you
have a couple of timeless, well-fitting pieces, work on putting together
the best outfits you can to be truly chic.

## Steps

### Defining Your Unique Style

1.  Evaluate your body shape. Bodies come in lots of different shapes
    and sizes, and each one is beautifully unique! Though you shouldn't
    feel like you need to categorize your body, there are a couple of
    general types that you can use as guidelines while finding clothes
    that feel and look good. If you want to, consider the following body
    types, and think about whether you identify with one of them. If you
    do, you can use this information to help guide you while buying
    clothes.
    -   If you're pear-shaped, your hips are wider than your shoulders.
    -   If you're apple-shaped, you tend to hold your weight right above
        your hips.
    -   If you have a wedge-shaped body, you have a broader chest and
        wider shoulders, while your waist and hips are narrow.[1]
    -   If you're hourglass-shaped, it means your waist and shoulders
        are similar in width, but you have a slender waist.
    -   If you have a rectangularly shaped body, your upper body tends
        to be similar in width from your shoulders through your hips.
        You may be on the slimmer side.
2.  Pick clothing that complements the shape of your body. Some people
    consider certain styles of clothing to be more flattering on certain
    body types than on others. If you identify with one of the above
    body types, consider the following recommendations while looking for
    clothes to add to your wardrobe. However, keep in mind that these
    are only guidelines for what you might wear– ultimately, it's
    totally up to you to decide what fits well and makes you feel
    good![2]![](Be_Chic_Step_9.jpeg "fig:Be_Chic_Step_9.jpeg")
    -   If you're pear-shaped, go for A-line skirts, as well as pants
        and skirts that flare out to balance out your lovely
        proportions. Try out different necklines and decorative
        accessories, too.
    -   If you're apple-shaped, try wide-leg pants and skirts to balance
        your shape. In addition, opt for v-necks and belts, which help
        cut down on volume on top. The empire cut is a great look for
        you!
    -   If you're wedge-shaped, opt for choices that show off your legs.
        Also, try full skirts, high-waisted styles, and thick belts.
    -   If you have an hourglass shape, choose fitted dresses, wrap
        dresses, and belts over shirts, all of which are good for
        showing off your waist and your curves!
    -   If you have a rectangularly shaped body, try wearing scoop necks
        and sweetheart tops to emphasize your chest area. In addition,
        long jackets are great for emphasizing your lean look.
3.  Come up with your own "uniform." If you have an idea of what kind of
    clothing suits you, build your wardrobe around that. For example, if
    you look really great in long skirts, try to buy a few that you
    like, and then base your daily outfits on these pieces. Just make
    sure to get slight variations in colors and styles so you don't look
    like you're wearing the exact same thing every day.[3]
    -   As another example, your uniform might be jeans and a shirt. You
        could cycle through jeans and a nice button-down shirt, jeans
        and a flowy blouse, or jeans and a simple, crisp T-shirt. You
        could roll up your cuffs or wear flats or heels, but your
        general uniform will stay mostly the same.
    -   Having a "uniform" doesn't mean that you can't mix it up
        whenever you feel like it. It just means that you know what
        works for you and what you like, and you tend to stick to it
        most of the time.
4.  Consider having items tailored to you. While tailoring isn't in
    everyone's budget, it can be cheaper than you'd expect. Getting an
    item tailored will help garments fit perfectly, which is ideal for
    looking chic and put-together. A little tuck here and there can make
    a garment look like it's made for you![4]7
    -   Check with your local laundromat, as many of them do simple
        alterations.

### Finding Chic Clothing and Accessories

1.  Opt for clothing that stays in fashion instead of the latest trends.
    Keeping up with trends can make you seem fashionable, but you can be
    chic without shelling out money every season. Choose clothing that
    doesn't go out of style and that always looks sophisticated, and you
    won't have to keep buying new clothes! Buying these kinds of pieces
    will help you create a timeless look that is very chic.[5]
    -   For instance, instead of buying into a current kitschy trend,
        opt for a leather jacket, a little black dress, or a trench
        coat, all of which always stay in style.
2.  Stick to pieces you really like. When you enter a clothing store,
    you're likely to see many pieces that you find acceptable, and you
    may even decide to purchase something just because it fits well.
    However, to keep your wardrobe under control and to help define your
    style, only buy pieces that really speak to you. If it doesn't make
    you happy or excited, leave it behind.[6]
3.  Look for stylish vintage pieces when you go thrift shopping. Thrift
    stores are a great way to find fashionable pieces for cheap. The
    trick is you have to dig a little. Look for upscale fabrics like
    silk or cashmere, and opt for older or vintage clothes, which tend
    to be better made.[7]
    -   If you find a piece you love that has a stain or needs a hem,
        try taking it to the dry cleaners. While you don't need to wear
        skin-tight clothing to be chic, clothing that fits well will
        make you look more chic.
    -   Clothes don't have to be expensive to be chic! However, if you
        spend a little more on your clothing staples, they do tend to
        last longer.
4.  Check out online resale sites for cheaper clothes that are easy to
    sort. These sites are basically upscale thrift stores, but they cut
    out the legwork of visiting stores in person. Plus, you can narrow
    down your search to just what you're looking for, making it easier
    to find what you need.[8]
    -   Try Poshmark or ThredUp, for instance.
5.  Ask older relatives or friends if you can dig through their closets.
    Not everyone has fashionable parents, but you may be surprised what
    hidden gems are tucked away back there. Often, your parents may have
    forgotten about many items themselves and are happy to pass them on
    to you. Plus, older clothes tend to be better made![9]
6.  Keep comfort in mind when picking your clothes. You don't have to
    give up comfort to be chic! Garments like leggings and even silk
    pajama pants can look chic with the right top and accessories. The
    key is to pair the look with a bit of glam, such as a long
    button-down shirt and fancy flats.[10]
    -   Similarly, add layers in winter to keep yourself warm. A large
        blanket scarf or a long robe coat can look chic and help you
        stay warm.[11]

### Putting Outfits Together

1.  Stick with a 3-color theme for each outfit to keep your look classy.
    If you have too many colors in your look, it can be a bit
    overwhelming. Instead, limit your color choices; in this case, a
    pattern can count as 1 of your colors, but be sure to match the rest
    of your outfit to the pattern.[12]
    -   For instance, try using black, gray, and red.
    -   Alternatively, try blue, green, and tan.
    -   If you have a pattern with red and green in it, make sure those
        are the other colors you choose for your outfit.
    -   White doesn't count as a color, but black does.
2.  Look to chic celebrities for outfit inspiration. Check out pictures
    of celebrities online to see how they put together an outfit! Of
    course, you probably don't want to copy outfits exactly, but you can
    put together similar looks based on what your favorite celebrities
    are wearing.[13]
    -   Try looking for pictures in magazines or just searching for your
        favorite celebrity online. The British royals are a great
        example of chic!
3.  Add long layers for an instantly chic look. No matter what kind of
    layers you choose, creating long lines gives your outfit an instant
    bump. Try a long coat in the fall, for instance, or a breezy, long
    scarf in the spring. Aim to layer different pieces of clothing that
    come down below your knees.[14]
    -   You could also layer a simple, long shift over leggings.
4.  Use belts to pull an outfit together. Through a belt over longer
    layers, and you have a great way to show off your waist. You can
    wear it at your natural waist or up under your chest for more
    definition. Plus, a belt can add that final touch that takes your
    outfit from plain to chic, as it can add just a bit of glam.[15]
    -   Alternatively, try a belt with a tucked-in shirt.
5.  Put on a shoe that accentuates your outfit. You don't need dramatic
    high heels that are uncomfortable for every outfit. In fact, flats
    and low, wide heels can be just as chic. The key is to tie your shoe
    into your outfit, either with a color or a material. That way, it
    fits into your overall look.[16]
    -   On the other hand, you can use your shoes to add a pop of color
        if the rest of your outfit is fairly monotone. For instance, if
        you're wearing mostly grays and blacks, bright red flats can add
        interest.
6.  Add on a few classy accessories. Try adding a pair of stylish
    sunglasses, a leather bag, or a fancy watch. You could also try a
    pair of statement earrings or a glamorous necklace. The key to
    keeping it chic is to not go overboard– aim for 1-2 statement pieces
    and leave it at that.[17]
    -   Try to make sure your accessories tie in to the rest of your
        outfit. For example, if you're wearing a jewel-toned dress, you
        could wear a cocktail ring or other costume jewelry in a similar
        color to emphasize the hue of your clothes.
    -   You could also try a fancy tie or cuff links.
    -   Your accessories don't have to be expensive. If you like them,
        put them on! Just don't go overboard.
7.  Think about the occasion and style your look accordingly. You can
    wear the same short black dress on a Sunday walk or for a night on
    the town. The key is to pick accessories and layers that make sense
    for the occasion.[18]
    -   For instance, to style your black dress for a Sunday walk, opt
        for some comfy boots, a long, loose sweater-shawl, and a fancy
        pair of sunglasses.
    -   For a night out on the town, opt for low heels, a statement
        necklace, and a fun little purse.
    -   If you have a favorite sweater, throw a blazer over it for a
        more formal event or pair it with slim jeans for a less formal
        event.

### Acting Chic

1.  Wear your style with confidence. Chic is at least in part about
    being confident in who you are. Once you figure out what your style
    is, hold your head high and wear it with pride. Confidence goes a
    long way to take an outfit from just okay to chic.[19]
    -   Stand up straight with your shoulders back. Don't act like
        you're trying to hide what you're wearing!
2.  Practice politeness to show you are chic. Being rude may seem like a
    way to be aloof, but a truly chic person knows that politeness is
    always key. Don't forget your "Pleases" and "Thank yous" when you're
    out and about, and hold the door open for others. Give up your seat
    when the train is full. These little details will help you seem more
    chic.[20]
    -   Similarly, practice [good manners](Have_Good_Manners "wikilink")
        when you're out to eat with someone. Treat the server with
        respect, and do your best to practice all those little rules
        your parents taught you!
3.  Keep yourself polished to look chic. A neat and tidy appearance is
    key to looking chic. It's important to keep your nails clean and
    groomed, opt for a tidy hairdo, keep your facial hair neatly plucked
    or trimmed, and avoid wearing stained or ill-fitting clothing.[21]
    -   Also, make sure your shoes always look fresh and polished, not
        scuffed and in need of a good cleaning!
4.  Wear your best any time of day. That is, don't save up your favorite
    jewelry or clothing for special occasions. Enjoy wearing a fancy
    piece of jewelry in the middle of the week or putting on that
    cashmere scarf just because it feels good on a Thursday. Besides
    making you feel good, it will add class to your day-to-day
    outfits.[22]
    -   Similarly, don't save that fancy tie for once-a-year occasions.
        Pull it out just because you feel like looking extra special
        today!
