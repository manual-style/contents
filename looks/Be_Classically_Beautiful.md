Audrey Hepburn, Vivien Leigh, Grace Kelly, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis, all these women are classic beauties. They all
understood that the key to classic beauty is to keep it simple.

## Steps

1.  **Wear classic pieces.** Classic women never wear trendy clothes.
    They wear classic pieces such as a simple black dress with a
    striking accessory, aviator glasses, a colorful scarf or a pretty
    set of pearls. Think of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's famous
    over-sized sunglasses and timeless suits. You don't have to go back
    to the nineteen-fifties, but expand your wardrobe when possible, and
    learn to have your own sophisticated style. (Some people are very
    classic and still keep up a colorful, fun
    appearance)![](Dress-Professionally-Step-11-Version-2.jpg "fig:Dress-Professionally-Step-11-Version-2.jpg")
2.  Keep make-up to a minimum. A little foundation, lip gloss and
    mascara can go a very long way. Learn how to make your best features

    out.![](Get-Pale-Skin-Step-15-Version-4.jpg "fig:Get-Pale-Skin-Step-15-Version-4.jpg")
3.  Respect your hair's natural texture. Always aim for a shiny and
    healthy style. Consult a hairdresser to figure out what style will
    suit your face and the easiest way to maintain your hair. You don't
    want to spend hours in front of the
    mirror.![](Style-Shoulder-Length-Hair-Step-4-Version-2.jpg "fig:Style-Shoulder-Length-Hair-Step-4-Version-2.jpg")
4.  Have good personal hygiene. Keep nails and toenails looking prim and
    proper, a simple French manicure is always
    elegant.![](Overcome-Sadness-Step-5-Version-2.jpg "fig:Overcome-Sadness-Step-5-Version-2.jpg")
5.  Be positive and happy. A positive outlook is always
    beautiful.![](Enjoy-Being-Alone-Step-2-Version-2.jpg "fig:Enjoy-Being-Alone-Step-2-Version-2.jpg")
    -   If something is really bothering you, it's okay to show it. But
        a Classic Beauty is known for being reserved, calm and always in
        control.
6.  Know what you're talking about. Intelligence is key. Brush up on as
    many subjects as
    possible.![](Become-Sociable-Step-6-Version-3.jpg "fig:Become-Sociable-Step-6-Version-3.jpg")
7.  Black is something classic beauties always wear, but try to
    accentuate the simplicity of it with accessories of a single other
    color such as red, white, or
    green.![](Dress-Professionally-Step-3-Version-2.jpg "fig:Dress-Professionally-Step-3-Version-2.jpg")
8.  Find the classic colors that work best with your complexion and eye
    color. For example:

    ![](Make-Someone-Feel-Better-Step-10.jpg "fig:Make-Someone-Feel-Better-Step-10.jpg")
    -   Blue eyes: Orange (complementary), Dark Blue, Dark Purple, Light
        Green, Grey, white, Black, Turquoise (analogous), Blue-Purple
        (analogous),Dark Red. Colors to avoid are: bright red, lime
        green, hot pink, brown, baby blue, any tints (colors visibly
        mixed with white)
    -   Brown eyes: Any Pink, Charcoal, any very dark color, Yellow (it
        brings out undertones in the eyes, despite it's undignified
        reputation) Green (also, undertones). Colors to avoid: none,
        brown is neutral, and so goes with everything.
    -   Green eyes: Purple (it really does bring out the color of your
        eyes), Dark red (green's complimentary color), dark blue, black,
        Brown, off-white. Colors to avoid: Grey, since it weighs down
        the natural tones in your iris, muting the color. However, if
        your eyes are bright green or blue green, gray brings it out
        quite nicely. Yellow, bright red (compliments can be jarring
        when both of the colors are vivid), bright white, orange, and
        green (which drowns out your eye color).
    -   Black eyes: any color.
    -   Ruddy (blue-toned/pink after exertion/freckled) skin: Cool
        colors (blue, purple, green, and all the analogous colors
        between them including Red-purple) Black, Grey. Colors to avoid:
        Yellow, and the corresponding analogous colors, any red (sorry)
        and White. Wear dark orange or red-orange at your discretion.
    -   Sallow (yellow toned/ tanning rather than freckling) any warm or
        neutral colors. Avoid yellow, but golds can look nice
    -   If you are African-American or have a darker complexion, you can
        wear almost any color. Golds are especially beautiful, though.
    -   If you have red hair, you can wear: Golds, beiges, corals,
        purples, very dark or light greens (just avoid the "Christmas
        green" color) dark blues.

## Tips

-   Being true to yourself and having confidence is key.
-   Having "inner beauty" is just as important as being outwardly
    beautiful. Being beautiful on the inside will show that you are a
    very special girl not worth losing.
-   Always have appreciation; that is the key to a happy life.
-   Tattoos and Body Piercings. Appearances convey a strong message to
    others; you can be judged by an individual or right before an event
    that will play a prominent role in your future (Ex. a prospective
    employer, acquiring a higher position in a reputable company, etc.).
    Therefore, take careful consideration when deciding if it is a good
    idea for you to get visible tattoos or body piercings. Even though a
    personâ€™s outward appearance does not automatically show his or her
    true inner qualities, appearances can reflect how a person is
    willing to be perceived by the world. Also keep in mind that
    although tattoos and piercings are individual expressions, they can
    be permanent or difficult (and often costly) to remove if you change
    your mind in the future. If you are in doubt about how tattoos and
    piercings may impact you in the future, forget about getting them
    and find other ways to show self expression, such as creating works
    of art, poetry, hobbies, etc.
-   Study classic beauties like Audrey Hepburn, Dorothy Dandridge, Grace
    Kelly, etc. and try to imitate them. It's fun and it will help.
-   Don't go for all the trends. Buy classic timeless pieces. When you
    buy something, think to yourself, if I look at a photo of myself ten
    years from now, will I laugh and say, "I cannot believe I actually
    wore that!".

## Warnings

-   Don't try to be someone you're not; be your own classic beauty.
