Being classy is not about being stuck up. You need to cultivate respect.
And that means respect for everyone, including yourself. Take care to be
polite to others and to reflect a genuine interest in them. Be confident
in yourself, dress how you want and act accordingly. If you want to be
classy, just follow these steps.

## Steps

### Looking Classy

1.  Avoid getting caught up in trends. There is nothing wrong with
    enjoying fashion or buying clothing you find attractive, but, avoid
    clothing that does not flatter your physique, coloring,
    etc.![](Be_Classy_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_1.jpg")
    -   Do not become a slave to fashion, or you may be regarded as
        foolish, "high maintenance", and/or shallow. The clothing you
        wear should enhance your personality, not create or alter it.
        This advice can be applied to many aspects of life in which you
        may feel pressured to "fit in."
2.  Define yourself with a clean and elegant look. Excellent
    presentation is half of the battle. Wear clothing and accessories
    that flatter your body, and never wear anything you feel
    uncomfortable in.[1] You don't have to wear the most expensive
    clothes on the market, or even buy knock-off clothes on the cheap.
    It's better to go for an individualized and put-together
    look.![](Be_Classy_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_2.jpg")
    -   Good hygiene is key. Shower daily and always show up to a new
        place feeling and looking fresh.[2]
3.  Don't underdress. If you have to go to a formal or semi-formal
    event, then you better know what that means. It's better to
    overdress a little than to underdress, and it's not okay to show up
    to a formal event wearing jeans if you needed to wear slacks or a
    dress.[3] It's not funny to wear sneakers if you needed to wear
    dress shoes,
    either.![](Be_Classy_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_3.jpg")
    -   Make sure you know the dress code and ask the host or your
        friends who are also attending if you're confused.
4.  Don't look like you were partying the night before. Avoid showing up
    anywhere wearing wristbands from the club from the night before,
    stamps or X's on your hands from the bars you went to; or just
    smelling like sweat, bars, beer, or even vomit. Get your day-old
    eyeliner off your face, take a shower, and don't show up anywhere,
    not even brunch, without looking like you're ready to start a new
    day; not crawl back into your
    lair.![](Be_Classy_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_4.jpg")
    -   Even if you did have a rough night, don't say: "*I am so
        hungover.*" That is not classy.
5.  Get your look together before you leave the house. Don't put on
    makeup in public, comb your hair in public, button your shirt,
    finish tying your shoes, check out your outfit, or do anything that
    says you took zero effort to get your act together before you left
    the house. Tuck in your shirt, put on your mascara and lip balm, and
    do absolutely everything you need to do before you go out into the
    world.![](Be_Classy_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_5.jpg")
    -   Avoid exposed undergarments. Ladies shouldn't let their bra
        straps show and men shouldn't let people see their boxers.
6.  Make sure your clothes are appropriate for the look you want to give
    off. It's okay to flaunt what you've got, but if it's too revealing,
    it might give off the wrong vibe if it's not worn to its intended
    purpose. Know what you're wearing and make sure it's comfortable.
    ![](Be_Classy_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Have great posture. Part of looking classy is having good posture.
    Keep a straight back, look in front of you instead of at the ground,
    and avoid slouching as much as you can. Don't cross your arms over
    your chest, but keep them at your sides to help your chest open up.
    If you lift your head high you will look and feel more classy. When
    you're sitting down, you should avoid slouching
    too.[4]![](Be_Classy_Step_7.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_7.jpg")

### Sounding Classy

1.  Don't curse. Having a foul mouth is just not classy at all. If you
    have the urge to curse, go into the bathroom and turn on the faucet
    while you let loose a row of expletives; or curse into a pillow.
    Never let people see you curse. This will often make you look
    trashy, and if you're cursing because you're angry, it appears as
    though you don't know how to control your temper. This is a big sign
    of having no
    class.![](Be_Classy_Step_8.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_8.jpg")
    -   Cursing, in general, should be avoided; cursing at specific
        people should be avoided even more.[5]
2.  Praise people behind their backs. That's right. Instead of talking
    about how someone is trashy, annoying, loud, or stupid, take some
    time to say something nice about a person who isn't there. Doing so
    will show that you've got class, and that you're confident and cool
    enough to realize the strengths of others instead of talking smack
    the second someone turns
    around.[6]![](Be_Classy_Step_9.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_9.jpg")
    -   If you praise people behind their backs, you'll look like a
        positive, self-possessed person, instead of someone who is
        always looking for trouble.
    -   If you're always gossiping, people will think you have no class
        because you don't respect the privacy and boundaries of other
        people.
3.  Don't be the loudest person in the room. Has someone ever walked
    into a party where you were hanging out and said, "I knew I was in
    the right place when I heard *your* voice from across the street"?
    If so, then you better pump *down* the volume. Everyone can hear you
    just fine. Don't think that you have to yell or shout to prove your
    point. Talking evenly, even if you're around a lot of people, is a
    sign of class because it means you're confident enough not to have
    to shout to get people's
    attention.[7]![](Be_Classy_Step_10.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_10.jpg")
    -   If you're concerned about this, ask your friends to rate you on
        a loudness scale. If you come close to a 10, or a 10 on the
        Richter scale, then it's time to tone it down.
4.  Don't talk about how much class you have. For some reason, many
    people who think they are classy just love to talk about how much
    class they have, especially in comparison to one person or another
    who has "no class" or "no class whatsoever." If you find yourself
    saying, "I've got class..." or, "I'm a classy girl..." then you are
    not acting so classy yourself. Let other people figure out how
    classy you really are instead of bragging about
    it.![](Be_Classy_Step_11.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_11.jpg")
    -   Ideally, if you're classy, you should *never* use the word
        "classy."
5.  Avoid burping in public. Burping in public is not cool, funny, or a
    great way to amuse your friends after you've had a burger and an
    extra large soda. If you love burping for fun, please stop. If you
    accidentally burp, that's no problem. Just put a hand to your mouth
    and excuse yourself.[8]
    ![](Be_Classy_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_12.jpg")
6.  Have proper cell phone etiquette. If you have class, then don't tap
    away at your cell phone every five seconds, barely look up from your
    phone in social situations, let it vibrate or buzz, even when you're
    in class, or pick up your phone in the middle of a crowded coffee
    shop and start yapping away about your most personal problem. Talk
    on your phone only when you're alone and when you're not
    interrupting anyone, unless it's an
    emergency.[9]![](Be_Classy_Step_13.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_13.jpg")
    -   It is seriously rude and not cool to let your phone ring every
        two seconds in a public place. It's called *silent* for a
        reason.
7.  Keep your voice calm even if you're angry. Even if you're in public
    and your significant other, best friend, or a perfect stranger has
    made you extremely angry, you have to take some deep breaths, close
    your eyes, talk slowly, and generally keep your cool. Don't let
    anyone catch you yelling, screaming, or throwing things in public.
    Do try not to do these things in private,
    either.![](Be_Classy_Step_14.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_14.jpg")
    -   Remember that you'll often be able to get your point across more
        easily if you are *not* yelling.
8.  Don't talk about money. It is not classy to talk about how much
    money you make, how much money you have, how much money your new
    car/kicks/jacket/earrings cost, or that you just got another $10,000
    raise.[10] Don't talk about how much your parents, boyfriend,
    closest friend, or anyone else makes, either. It's just not
    classy.![](Be_Classy_Step_15.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_15.jpg")

### Acting Classy

1.  Be authentic. If you have class, live in a way of which you should
    be proud. If you have to be phony and deceptive, you should consider
    why this is. A person of honor and integrity never needs to hide
    behind a facade. If you can't show your true self to the world, who
    will people see? Just stop pretending. Though you may be tired of
    hearing that you should, "be yourself," it's really true. If you're
    faking your whole image, you'll never really make
    it.[11]![](Be_Classy_Step_16.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_16.jpg")
    -   You don't have to be 100% yourself in every single situation.
        You have to adapt depending on whether you're talking to a
        professor or your best friend. You should, however, always be
        yourself at your core.
2.  [Be independent](Be_Independent "wikilink"). You must be courteous,
    but do not bend over backward to please others. If you do, you may
    find yourself being taken advantage of in the future. Limit your
    time and availability and draw boundaries with others so that they
    are aware of your limits. Do your own thing and get some "me time"
    to figure out who you really are instead of being obsessed with
    always having plans is very
    classy.![](Be_Classy_Step_17.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_17.jpg")
    -   People will see you as a unique soul and will respect you even
        more.
3.  [Be assertive](Be_Assertive "wikilink"). Avoid passive-aggressive
    thinking; it's likely to trip you up eventually. Assertiveness
    demonstrates maturity, thoughtfulness, and confidence. Class
    requires balance, and assertiveness is a prime example of this
    concept.![](Be_Classy_Step_18.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_18.jpg")
4.  Don't feign knowledge. When your group or date is speaking about a
    subject you don't know or understand, it is prudent to either state
    that you don't know much about the subject at hand; or if you want
    to carry the conversation, ask for more information about the
    subject. Not only does this show maturity, but it also shows that
    you are keeping an open
    mind.![](Be_Classy_Step_19.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_19.jpg")
    -   People will respect you even more for admitting when you don't
        know something.
5.  Treat others the way you would want to be treated. The Golden Rule
    truly is a time-honored guide for treating adults and children with
    class.[12] Giving others advance notice before canceling dinner
    invitations, speaking up for those who cannot stand up for
    themselves, calling your parents to update them on yourself,
    checking in with friends; these are all simple gestures that
    demonstrate your class and
    authenticity.![](Be_Classy_Step_20.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_20.jpg")
    -   Ensure you choose friends who share your values.
    -   Everyone should be treated as your equal until they prove to be
        inferior. Give people the benefit of the doubt.
    -   Always, always respect your elders. Being rude to your elders is
        the ultimate sign of a lack of class.
6.  Be open to [personal
    development](Start_a_Personal_Development_Plan "wikilink"). Do not
    berate yourself, but be receptive to [constructive
    change](Handle_Changes_in_Your_Life "wikilink"). In our world,
    change is inevitable. Be a [positive](Be_Positive "wikilink") and
    flexible part of it, and show others the way as well. Face life
    rather than burying your head in the sand and others will know
    instinctively that you are someone whose opinion
    counts.![](Be_Classy_Step_21.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_21.jpg")
    -   Take classes that teach you new skills and that help you improve
        yourself.
    -   Remember that the learning process is never over. It's not
        classy to think you know everything.
7.  Be [knowledgeable](Be_Knowledgeable "wikilink") and aware. It is
    wise to become politically, culturally, and religiously aware. Even
    the most basic knowledge can save a person from embarrassment and
    awkwardness. If you know in advance that you will be spending time
    with someone of an unfamiliar background, it is a good idea to do
    more in-depth research to avoid embarrassing faux
    pas.![](Be_Classy_Step_22.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_22.jpg")
    -   [Be well read.](Be_Well_Read "wikilink") This is an important
        part of being classy and being able to keep up a classy
        conversation.
8.  Know when to ask for help, but avoid desperate behavior. This is the
    kiss of death for the classy person. Only desperate times call for
    desperate measures. Take a deep breath, be strong, and move through
    the situation with elegance and grace. You will be the victor for
    it, no matter the outcome. If things get out of hand and you feel
    completely overwhelmed, ask for help from a close friend or family
    member.[13]![](Be_Classy_Step_23.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_23.jpg")
    -   It's classy to admit that you have a problem and to try to fix
        it. It's not classy to be in denial.
9.  Be responsible. Classy people leave their surroundings in a
    condition at least as good as they found them. Unless they are in a
    restaurant with wait staff whose job it is to do the clearing up,
    classy people insist on taking care of their own trash and baggage,
    not expecting others to pick up after them when others do favors for
    them, whereas stuck-up or spoiled people assume it's only to be
    expected and ignore others' assistance. Truly classy people are
    quick to notice and to express their gratitude and their
    appreciation.![](Be_Classy_Step_24.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_24.jpg")
    -   If you're a house guest, clean up after yourself. If you
        borrowed a friend's car, fill it with gas before you return it.
    -   If you made a mistake, take responsibility for it instead of
        blaming it on someone else.
10. Be considerate.[14] Truly classy people instinctively recoil at the
    thought of inconveniencing others, offending them, getting in other
    peoples' way, or in any way making nuisances of themselves. Classy
    people are all about minding their own business when among strangers
    and putting others at ease when in social situations. Truly classy
    people are gracious and affable to everyone, whether the CEO, the
    mail carrier, or the
    custodian.![](Be_Classy_Step_25.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_25.jpg")
    -   Classy people know others' names and use them when greeting
        people they see regularly, whether the door attendant, the
        security guard, or the boss' wife. Classy people treat everyone
        the same--with courtesy and respect.
11. Keep the promiscuity to a minimum. If you want to be classy, then
    you shouldn't go hooking up with random people every night. If
    that's your thing, at least don't talk about it, brag about it, or
    walk around with lots of visible hickeys. Classy people don't kiss
    and tell, so don't divulge the details of your latest hook up
    session. Don't let people see you making out on the dance floor
    either, because guess what: that is not
    classy.![](Be_Classy_Step_26.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_26.jpg")
    -   It's okay to experiment and have several sexual partners, but if
        you brag about it or treat it like a contest, you will run into
        trouble.
12. Have good manners. Say, "Yes, Ma'am," "No, Sir," and, "Thank you,"
    as often as you can. Be polite to your elders. If you have to
    sneeze, sneeze into a tissue, not the air. Don't wipe your nose on
    your sleeve. Don't pick food out of your teeth in public. Generally,
    don't put your finger into your mouth or nose. Acquire at least
    basic table manners. Put a napkin on your lap before you eat a nice
    meal. Avoid scratching yourself in public. Don't brush your hair in
    public, apply make up in public, or pick at your clothes in public.
    Do these things in privacy; wait until you've found a bathroom or
    are alone. Don't break out in boisterous laughter.[15]
    ![](Be_Classy_Step_27.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_27.jpg")
    -   Take an etiquette class if you need to.
13. Be a classy drinker. Don't get so wasted that you have no idea what
    happened the night before. That means no blacking out--and even no
    browning out. Keep your control; people should see you looking in
    charge of your own mind and body. If people see you stumbling around
    and slurring your speech at night, then there's no way people will
    think you're classy even if you're carrying around textbooks and
    looking classy during the
    day.![](Be_Classy_Step_28.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_Step_28.jpg")
    -   If you have gotten yourself in trouble more than a handful of
        times when you drink, then it may be time to stop.

## Tips

-   Stand up straight. Sit up straight. Act with purpose. Think before
    you speak.
-   If people judge you, ignore it if it is mean or bad; but say thank
    you if it is good.
-   Being classy isn't all about how you look; it's mostly about how
    well you treat others.
-   Try to look fresh, no heavy makeup, tan, and so forth. Those things
    often make a person look trashy.
-   Be honest and talk exactly to the point. Avoid needless talking.
-   Being classy is acquired through manners, and then appearance. No
    matter how good you look, if you don't have manners, no one will
    treat you well; and you will not be classy.
-   Don't bash other people on social media.
-   Have at least, some knowledge of etiquette.[16]
-   Don't go wandering around drunk as a skunk. This will ruin your
    image.
-   Don’t wear too much jewelry. A simple, decent watch; small earrings
    and one or two rings are quite enough.
-   Always be open to help others.

## Warnings

-   Mistakes are human. If you slip up, forgive yourself, apologize to
    anyone who may have been hurt by the mistake, learn from it and
    continue to grow.
-   Changing your behavior may feel unnatural. If it does, remind
    yourself that you are a work in progress. A classy person is simply
    one who consistently exhibits gracious, kind behavior.
