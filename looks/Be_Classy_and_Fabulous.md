Many 'how to' articles about ladylike behaviour will insist that a daily
blow-dry and remembering to smile will transform the reader into a
goddess of poise and charm. This is of course nonsense. One requires far
more than a touch of eyeliner and an aversion to dirty jokes to be a
true good example of womanhood.

## Steps

1.  Strive to improve oneself. Curiosity is the driving force of
    humanity; it pushes us to explore and push boundaries. The very
    best, classiest and most respected kind of human is the kind that
    never stops learning and exploring new ideas - being the best you
    can be. There are several ways to ensure you are functioning at your
    highest potential, and the first step is to prepare yourself to
    tackle them! If you want to be classy and fabulous, you must work at
    that reputation. It won't happen for
    you.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Know your stuff. Broadening your mind is an excellent place to start
    if you want to come across as a really great human being. Think of
    strong female leaders like Aung San Su Kyi and Margaret Thatcher -
    for all the controversy that (unfortunately in this day and age)
    inevitably surrounds women in leadership, those who do succeed and
    those who make a difference are sharp and intelligent. All women
    should take pride in their education, and there are things one can
    do every day to boost educational
    credentials.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Write well. Always use correct spelling and grammar when
    writing.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Speak eloquently. Try not to use slang or drop your
    consonants.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Expand your vocabulary. Look up words you don't
    know.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Watch the news. Even if it's just a quick scan of the headlines over
    breakfast, make sure you are keeping up on what is going on in the
    world.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Find a list of classics and get to the local
    library!![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_7.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Develop a grasp on national and world politics. You have a say in
    the running of this world, so make it your business to understand
    it - but don't discuss your views openly unless specifically asked.
    That would be inappropriate and
    boorish.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_8.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Develop your intellect. Remember: it always, always, always pays to
    put that little bit extra effort into your intellectual life,
    because anybody with a hint of class knows that there's nothing less
    impressive than a
    dimwit.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_9.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_9.jpg")
10. Stay healthy. If you want to remain healthy and active until the day
    you die, and have a dignified life right until the end, it's
    imperative that you keep yourself running smoothly. Your health is
    your most precious possession - without it, everything else in your
    life takes a back seat. So do that 20 minute DVD workout three times
    a week, or join a dance or martial arts class, or a sports team, or
    take up marathon training (this can be truly addictive after the
    first couple of weeks). Look at Wonder Woman - a female powerhouse
    with an Amazonian body, which not only packed enough of a punch to
    save the universe but also looked stunning in a ballgown. Make her
    your
    idol.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_10.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_10.jpg")
11. Make sure you're putting in what you want to get out! One piece of
    advice is that you should never eat anything that doesn't have a
    root or a mother, and it's very true. Keeping preservatives and
    additives to a minimum. Instead, eat wholesome, natural foods -
    these are what make the body work best, because that's the kind of
    food it's supposed to eat. Besides, would you rather be seen
    snacking on wholemeal toast and a fruit smoothie, or cramming a
    saucy, greasy McDonald's sandwich into your mouth (and likely
    spilling the contents on your lap in the process)? Which do YOU
    think is more
    fabulous?![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_11.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_11.jpg")
12. Looks count. It's sad but true that looks count. This article is not
    going to tell you what clothes to wear or what colour your hair
    should be, but there are five basic rules one can follow that make
    the way you look a positive influence on your
    reputation.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Your body and clothes should always be clean and odourless.
    -   You shouldn't expose your legs above mid-thigh, your midriff, or
        too much cleavage. It's basic decency. Keep it private.
    -   Your underwear should NEVER be visible when out and about.
        Remember that even white bras show through white tops - neutral
        is best.
    -   Your hair and make-up should be neat and simple.
    -   Your hair and make-up shouldn't take more than ten minutes to
        style.
13. Behaving yourself is the next key step. So now you're well-informed,
    well-nourished and well-presented - excellent! You now have to be
    well-behaved to finish off the complete classy picture. We all have
    a friend or acquaintance who is a little 'gauche' and awkward, and
    in order to avoid those traits all you have to do is remain aware of
    yourself and your actions whilst in company. Of course, whilst home
    alone, nobody's watching to see if you lounge around glamorously in
    a satin robe or just slob about in PJs, but in company, poise is
    everything. The following steps are pointers regarding social
    behaviour for classy ladies who try to uphold a
    standard.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_13.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_13.jpg")
14. Sit up straight. I can't repeat this enough. Imagine you are a
    ballerina holding a position on stage. Imagine you're having dinner
    with royalty. Imagine anything, as long as it keeps your shoulders
    firm and straight and your neck elongated. Good posture improves
    circulation and digestion (helpfully avoiding unladylike moments of
    wind at the table), as well as brightening the eyes and smoothing
    out your figure. Never slouch, lean or hunch. You are a
    lady!![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_14.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_14.jpg")
15. Cross your legs at the ankle under you chair. This is the most
    flattering pose for them and doesn't give you pins and
    needles.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_15.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_15.jpg")
16. When eating, use your knife and fork rather than just the fork. Cut
    off one mouthful at a time (it's rude to take little bites off a
    larger piece on your fork). Naturally, close your mouth when eating.
    Basically avoid anything that involves exposing the contents of your
    mouth, overfilling your mouth, or the possibility of a spillage or
    mess. Also don't clink your cutlery and crockery together. When you
    have finished eating, put your knife and fork side by side in the
    centre of the
    plate.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_16.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_16.jpg")
17. Touching yourself is awkward and should be avoided in public. for
    example, scratching one's nose, touching a pimple, picking at a
    hangnail, re-arranging one's clothing etc. Hands off if there are
    people around! It just makes you look awkward and socially unaware.
    You should seem effortless, as if you don't have to think about
    mundane things like that. Even if you're thinking, "Oh my God, my
    back is really itchy!" - do not scratch it until you're in private.
    The only exception is moving hair out of your eyes, but please, if
    this happens frequently, get a
    haircut!![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_17.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_17.jpg")
18. Another key point is conversation. The biggest rule of holding a
    classy conversation is that people with class do not, under any
    circumstances, start a topic of conversation about themselves. Don't
    mention yourself until asked (which you will be if you ask first, as
    long the people you are with have basic social skills. If they do
    not then either slowly educate them by example, or avoid them in
    future). It's all right to talk about yourself if asked, just don't
    be the first to bring yourself
    up.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_18.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_18.jpg")
19. Most especially, do not mention your appearance. This is a sign of
    insecurity. If you find yourself wanting to ask if you hair's okay,
    if your clothes fit all right, if your label can be seen, what you
    should do with your hair - please bite your tongue unless it's your
    best friend. Discussing your own appearance is just not done.
    However, if in receipt of a compliment, you may naturally smile
    gratefully and give a humble thank-you before returning it
    pleasantly.![](Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_19.jpg "fig:Be_Classy_and_Fabulous_Step_19.jpg")

## Tips

-   Remember that the purpose of wanting to be classy and fabulous is
    not to look amazing, get tons of male attention and drown in party
    invitations. A classy woman is clever, healthy and friendly; a
    fabulous woman looks clean, neat and attractive without seeking
    compliments or advancement from her looks. The goal is to be lovely
    just because it's good and nice to be so - for yourself, rather than
    for men or your friends or rivals. It's your life, and if you want
    to use it to its full potential, learn everything you can, be as fit
    as you can, be as attractive as you can, and be as gracious and
    dignified as you can. Just by deciding to be that woman, you are
    already classy and fabulous, and you need to let that light shine
    out into the world and convince others to follow in your footsteps.
-   You may be one of those people who feels like a spy after watching a
    James Bond movie. If this applies to you, then the best kind of
    movie to watch for a woman hoping to be classy is period dramas:
    Gosford Park, Brideshead Revisited, any Austen, etcetera. This
    article does not mean to say that everyone should put on airs and
    act like a dreadful aristocratic snob - certainly not! But watching
    aristocrats float about looking glamourous does wonders for the
    posture and speech - you end the film wanting to be all upright and
    properly spoken and demure, which can only aid in the process of
    becoming ladylike. Even the protagonists that don’t possess much of
    a fortune in Jane Austen works are still strong, confident and
    clever without the cattiness, frivolities and vanity of the richer
    women.
-   If you're lacking inspiration, you could find a role model to
    emulate: a strong, classy, beautiful woman who really represents
    female life at its best. Perfect examples do not crop up in the
    everyday media - nobody could ever suggest that Katie Price was a
    shining example of classy womanhood after all - but they are out
    there. Look up Dr Beverly Crusher, C. J. Cregg, Laura Roslin,
    Temperance Brennan, Mae C. Jemison, Queen Elizabeth I of England,
    Lizzie Bennet, Captain Kathryn Janeway, Captain Amelia, Diana Prince
    or Eowyn of Rohan. You may even have an inspiring woman in your
    family or neighborhood.

## Warnings

-   At all costs, avoid becoming a snob or a know it all. Even if you've
    just got the gist of Russian politics or website creation from a
    bout of research you've been doing, don't brag about it to friends
    or try to squeeze it into conversations. Wait to be asked - they'll
    be so impressed that you knew such fascinating things all along and
    never said a word! It makes you a little mysterious too, which is a
    definite ladylike quality!
-   Don't worry about your appearance. Don't change for others. If you
    think you look good, then as long as you're clean and decent, THAT'S
    FINE. You can look however you want. A lady is a lady in her gym
    clothes, in a suit, in jeans or in a frilly dress. A lady is a lady
    with bright blue hair, if she wants to be. It's your attitude, your
    determination to be better and to be classy that make you who you
    are. You can look however you want.
-   Similarly, making an intellectual quip then throwing your head back
    in false posh laughter is NOT CLASSY. It's very, very gauche. But
    surprisingly easy to do by accident. It's also good to avoid
    pretending to recognize classical music/artworks/literature or
    getting on your high horse about a cause that you actually don't
    know very much about. Intellectual arguments just make the arguer
    look like a poser. Only join in if you really know what you're
    talking about.
