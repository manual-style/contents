Have you ever wanted to have that funky looking room? What about those
so stylish clothes that are cute, and unique? Personality = popular?
Follow these rules and you're there!

## Steps

1.  Start with the room. Paint the walls a funky color like lavender,
    nursery yellow, orange, sea foam green or mint. Next, do something
    with the furniture. Any bed will work but save up for a cute quilt.
    Or, if you already have a quilt buy a quilt cover. Only buy one in a
    bright color with a funky pattern. (see tips) Do not put any
    celebrity posters and alike. That is not cool, and it's an idol...
    so no. Instead, put up a painting that you bought or one that you
    did yourself! The brighter, the better and make it funky. Different
    textures bring the room together and give it a personal touch. Try
    fluffy, sequins and soft throw pillows. Put these on your bed in a
    cool position. Buy a bean bag chair or two and a butterfly chair in
    cool colors. A wood desk is also cool to put in there. Mix in a
    little tiny bit of vintage like a chandelier or an antique desk or
    coffee
    table.![](Be_Colorful_Chic_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_Colorful_Chic_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Make sure your clothing to be different than others. Put a new twist
    on a current trend. For instance, if everyone is wearing billowy
    shirts with Bermuda shorts, wear the billowy shirts with jeans
    instead. Buy dark jeans instead of light ones. They tend to make the
    bright colors pop. And you want that. Accessorize, accessorize,
    accessorize! Wear a beret or 2-3 necklaces. Basically wear different
    but still trendy clothes. Go to second-hand stores and stock up. BUY
    TONS OF SECOND HAND CLOTHING to get a different look. I mean, how
    cool is it to wear the same shirt and belt as six other girls in
    your grade from the local Hollister? Not very. You need to stand out
    and have your own
    clothes.![](Be_Colorful_Chic_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Colorful_Chic_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Have good manners. No burping, farting, talking with your mouth full
    or coughing without covering in public. Hold it in or cover up.
    Flirt a little with people who you like. Get good grades, have lots
    of friends and keep it up. Be creative and be a leader. Make the
    right choices and now maybe everyone will follow you. Have fun with
    your new look and don't change for
    anyone.![](Be_Colorful_Chic_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_Colorful_Chic_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Work with your natural beauty. If you have big eyes? Flaunt them.
    Some [cute hairstyles](Do_Simple_and_Cute_Hairstyles "wikilink") are
    straight, curly, french braids, one ponytail, 1\\2 pony and pinned
    up bangs. Don't wear much make-up if any at all. A little blush or
    mascara but leave everything else behind. Curl your eyelashes too,
    if you
    want.![](Be_Colorful_Chic_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Colorful_Chic_Step_4.jpg")

## Tips

-   Buy the little scarves and jewelry. Buy most of your clothes at
    places that are not extreme brand name and make sure their logos
    aren't printed in big letters across the tees and jeans. Buy clothes
    at thrift stores too.
-   COLORFUL COLORS: Hot pink, lavender, orange, nursery yellow, lime
    green, sea foam green and white
-   Have good manners and talk to people. Be very friendly.
-   Have good hygiene. Take a shower every or every other day.
-   Don't be stuck up. Just because you might have a cooler room and
    nicer clothes than some people doesn't make you better, it makes you
    luckier. So don't brag.
-   FUNKY PATTERNS: Stripes, polka-dots, squares, diamonds and animal
    prints.

## Warnings

-   Don't do anything stupid like drink or do drugs. Only losers do that
    and you are definitely not one of them.
