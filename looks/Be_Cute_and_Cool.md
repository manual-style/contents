Being cute *and* cool at the same time requires a sense of style and
confidence.

## Steps

1.  Define your idea of cute and cool. It's not only the clothes you
    wear or the makeup, but your attitude and opinions as
    well.![](Compromise_with_Your_Parents_Step_1.jpg "fig:Compromise_with_Your_Parents_Step_1.jpg")
    -   Are you Goth, Emo, Scene, Earthy, Classic, Geek, Bohemian,
        Fairy, etc?
    -   Do you have a selection of favorite sayings and quote lines to
        share with your friends and others?
2.  Choose your clothes and makeup. Select your fave dress or clothes.
    Match a quality makeup style with the
    clothes.![](Act_Suspicious_Step_6.jpg "fig:Act_Suspicious_Step_6.jpg")
    -   Don't overdo the makeup. Allow the clothes to also reflect your
        style and good taste. Only add makeup on your lips, eye lashes
        and your cheeks.
    -   Add some accessories. Choose accessories like earrings, a
        necklace and bracelets. If you want to add a hat, then sure.
    -   If you have a hand bag, add it as you want.
    -   Choose some quality shoes. The sort of shoes you want will
        depend on what activity level you have - flats or sneakers for a
        sporty style, high heels for classic or chic style, ballet flats
        for many looks.
3.  Fix your hair. While you can design anything, don't waste too much
    time. A neat, tidy style is better than anything takes you ages to
    produce. Make sure it dosen't look like you spent a whole day trying
    to fix your hair, as this dosen't give off a cool natural
    look.![](Be_Smart_Without_Being_Nerdy_Step_9.jpg "fig:Be_Smart_Without_Being_Nerdy_Step_9.jpg")
4.  Have excellent posture. Don't slouch or try to shrink into yourself.
    Hold yourself high and walk like a model or a confident person. And
    be
    confident!![](Exude_Confidence_Step_4.jpg "fig:Exude_Confidence_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Laugh a lot, be happy, and smile. Cute is all about being likable
    and friendly; make sure your personality reflects
    this.![](Avoid_Talking_in_Class_Step_6.jpg "fig:Avoid_Talking_in_Class_Step_6.jpg")
    -   Giggling is cute.
6.  Hang out with your pals. Make your time cool by doing cool
    things.![](Do_Without_Having_a_Boyfriend_in_Middle_School_Step_3.jpg "fig:Do_Without_Having_a_Boyfriend_in_Middle_School_Step_3.jpg")
    -   Go to the movies, the mall, shopping.
    -   Dine out together in cool cafes and cool meal places.

## Tips

-   Swing your hair for a little flirt trick. If you want something or
    to get someone's attention, doing this with a wave works on just
    about everyone.
-   For your hair, maybe let it go or tie it a ponytail or half
    ponytail. Don't try too hard!
-   Don't put on too much makeup. It can look very silly.

## Warnings

-   Don't be mean, rude, or critical of people. That's not cute and not
    appealing. If you don't like what someone looks like, keep it to
    yourself.
