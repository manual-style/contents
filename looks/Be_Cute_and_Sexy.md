## Steps

1.  Pull your hair back in a cute ponytail or pigtails. These both give
    you a classic cute look. A ponytail keeps it out of your face, and
    is always easy. Style your hair how you like it. Being comfortable
    with your appearance gives you the self-confidence you need to be
    social and
    energetic.![](Be_Cute_and_Sexy_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_Cute_and_Sexy_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Wear pinks and baby blues. No matter what your style, you can pull
    off a cute look with a little pink sweater or pair of shoes. One
    cute look is a pair of jeans and a pink cardigan, paired with your
    cutest flats. Wear an outfit that's tasteful and stylish. Avoid
    low-cut tops and super-short skirts and shorts. The goal is for you
    to look cute, not
    trashy![](Be_Cute_and_Sexy_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Cute_and_Sexy_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Put some cute barrettes in your hair. Whether you have it back in a
    ponytail or leave it straight, pin back your bangs or a chunk of
    hair with a cute barrette. Pick accessories that match your outfit,
    but don't go
    overboard.![](Be_Cute_and_Sexy_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_Cute_and_Sexy_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Act cute, and it permeates your look. Sweet girls who are kind and
    courteous to those around them, are usually very cute because of
    their giving personalities. Be careful to not become anyone's
    doormat, but lend a hand to your friends and
    family.![](Be_Cute_and_Sexy_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Cute_and_Sexy_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Play with kids. Children have a habit of bringing out the cute side
    of anyone. After an afternoon of watching cartoons and dancing with
    your favorite niece or nephew, you look very cute with a childlike
    countenance.![](Be_Cute_and_Sexy_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_Cute_and_Sexy_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Leave the high heels in the closet, and don some cute tennis shoes
    or flat sandals with flowers or bows on them. Pair cute shoes with a
    cute lacy skirt and top, and you have the look in the
    bag.![](Be_Cute_and_Sexy_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_Cute_and_Sexy_Step_6.jpg")
