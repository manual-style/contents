Are you shy and don't like to attract attention? Or maybe you just like
dark colors. OR you want to come off as mysterious to new people you
meet. Whatever the reason is, you have come to the right place! Let's
get cracking!

## Steps

1.  Shop at stores such as Tilly's, Zumiez, Vampirefreaks, and/or
    GoodGoth for your clothes. You want plain button down shirts,
    dress-pants, and solid or band t-shirts in any
    color.![](Be_Dark_and_Mysterious_(Girls)_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_Dark_and_Mysterious_(Girls)_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Don't limit yourself to spend, spend, spend. You can make your
    clothing and accessories out of old clothes! Being Goth means also
    being
    original!![](Be_Dark_and_Mysterious_(Girls)_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Dark_and_Mysterious_(Girls)_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Wear darker make up. Smokey eye, or cat eye liner would
    suffice.![](Be_Dark_and_Mysterious_(Girls)_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_Dark_and_Mysterious_(Girls)_Step_3.jpg")
4.  When people ask you questions, just ask why in a playful way and
    laugh when they give you the answer. This will ease you out of
    answering the
    question.![](Be_Dark_and_Mysterious_(Girls)_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Dark_and_Mysterious_(Girls)_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Let's talk shoes! Combat boots, Ballet Flats, and heels are good
    shoes. They don't have to be black. For ballet flats, try
    lace.![](Be_Dark_and_Mysterious_(Girls)_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_Dark_and_Mysterious_(Girls)_Step_5.jpg")
6.  The patterns you can wear are lace, plain, polka-dot, stripes and
    any other type of pattern. If you think you look good in it, you
    probably
    do!![](Be_Dark_and_Mysterious_(Girls)_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_Dark_and_Mysterious_(Girls)_Step_6.jpg")
