How to impress people? Being elegant is the answer; it makes you look
feminine, attractive, and mature! This article will show you how to be
just that.

## Steps

### Looking Elegant

1.  Be clean. Practice good hygiene. Take a shower when you need to and
    keep your hair clean. Brush your teeth and use deodorant, to keep
    yourself smelling
    fresh.[1]![](Be_Elegant_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Be tidy. Keep your hair brushed, your nails reasonably trimmed, and
    any excess body hair should also be carefully maintained to
    reasonable
    lengths.![](Be_Elegant_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Use subtle makeup. Use only enough concealer, foundation and powder
    to even your skin tone and cut down on shine. Eye shadow and lip
    colors should be subtle and use neutral tones line browns and grays.
    Eyeliner and mascara should be
    minimal.![](Be_Elegant_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   There are occasions, however, where bolder lip colors may be
        appropriate. If you are going out for a formal evening, for
        example, bright red lips may be warranted.
4.  Choose sleek hairstyles. When you think elegant women you usually
    think Audrey Hepburn, Veronica Lake, or Nicole Kidman. And what do
    they have in common? That sleek, beautiful hair, of course. Choose
    hairstyles which show off the satin quality of your hair and
    compliment your features and dress style. This will give you a more
    elegant
    look.[2]![](Be_Elegant_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Get your nails done. Good choices for nail polish are pale pink,
    clear, or a french manicure. But remember that any colour can look
    elegant, it all depends on how you carry it off. Don't rule out any
    colour - including black - unless you don't like it. Look at some
    photos of celebrities' nails at events. They wear all colours,
    including black, green, and orange, and many of them still look
    elegant.![](Be_Elegant_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Use good perfume. You may not see when someone smells nice but it
    will form a certain picture in your mind. Leave a lasting impression
    by using a subtle perfume, applied correctly. Elegant top notes
    include scents
    like:![](Be_Elegant_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Jasmine
    -   Rose
    -   Amber
7.  Stand tall. Having good posture will go a long way towards being
    perceived as elegant. Work on your posture[3] and make sure that you
    are standing nice and tall. This will also make you look thinner and
    curvier.

### Dressing Elegantly

1.  Wear nice clothes. Avoid clothes which look overly casual, dirty,
    stained, or ruined. Don't wear clothes that have holes or otherwise
    look distressed. Try to go out in nice - smart but simple- clothes
    when you run
    errands.[4]![](Be_Elegant_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Wear classic cuts. Avoid trendy clothes like bell-bottom jeans or
    over-sized shoulder pads. Instead, opt for classic cuts on most
    items of clothing. This will keep you looking timelessly elegant.
    Knee length skirts with even hem lines, tailored button-down shirts
    in men's style, and knee-length trench coats are among a large
    number of classic cut
    items.![](Be_Elegant_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Wear clothes that fit. Make sure that the clothes you do have fit.
    They should not be too small (showing or creating bulges) or too
    large (hanging from your frame). Don't get married to a size, every
    time you try on new clothes, also try on a size up and a size down.
    Get items tailored, if you can, to ensure an even better
    fit.![](Be_Elegant_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Choose quality fabrics. Lean away from cheap acrylic material or
    cheap cotton and opt for clothing made from more luxurious
    materials. This will show and make your clothing look more
    expensive, even if it isn't. Silk, satin, modal, cashmere, Chantilly
    or other quality lace, many sheer fabrics, and limited velvet are
    all acceptable options. Thick materials that add bulk should usually
    be avoided, as these will detract from your smooth
    lines.![](Be_Elegant_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Choose high contrast or classic colors. When choosing colors, go for
    high contrast colors that are very light and dark compared to each
    other (red, white and black, for example). Classic neutral colors
    also work well (grey, beige, navy, plum, emerald green, champagne
    pink,
    etc.).![](Be_Elegant_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Other elegant color combinations include blue and gold, pink and
        white, and white and teal/seafoam.
6.  Keep it simple. Keep your outfits simple: not too many accessories,
    not too many layers. Avoid patterns and pattern mixing. Don't get
    overly showy, either. Jewelry should be simple and should go with
    what you are wearing and doing. Don't wear anything that is too
    dressy for what you're doing: go for nice, but not
    unreasonable.![](Be_Elegant_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For example, a cocktail dress is a bit much for going grocery
        shopping but a black or navy pencil skirt, a cream-colored
        sweater and brown jacket and boots are about right. Sweats would
        be the bad choice; too casual.
7.  Accessorize strategically. Choose accessories which compliment your
    outfit without going over the top. Accessories should also
    compliment your features and physique. For example, avoid wide or
    large earrings if you have a big face, or wear vertically striped
    stockings to make your legs look longer and
    thinner.![](Be_Elegant_Step_14_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_14_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Keep it classy. Don't wear clothes that reveal too much skin, are
    too tight, or use materials which look low-class (leopard print,
    fuzzy materials, lam√©, etc). Dressing this way can make you look
    cheap or like an escort. It will also make you look like you're
    trying too hard. Dress classy by following the advice above and
    avoiding these pitfalls, and you'll look elegant all the time.

### Acting Elegant

1.  Speak exceptionally well. Use proper grammar, a broad vocabulary,
    avoid contractions and colloquialisms, and enunciate when you speak.
    This will make you come across as classy and elegant, a real lady.
    If you aren't in the habit of speaking well like this, practice
    while you are alone, possibly in front of a
    mirror.![](Be_Elegant_Step_16.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_16.jpg")
    -   Do not feel like you have to take on a different accent in order
        to sound more elegant. The accent is rarely as much of a problem
        as vocabulary and grammar.
2.  Stay calm at all times. Do not get overly emotional, either very sad
    (dramatic crying) or angry (yelling at people and making a scene).
    This will undo every bit of elegance in an instant. Instead, be calm
    and relaxed.![](Be_Elegant_Step_17.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_17.jpg")
    -   Remember: if you're not going to die (and neither is anyone
        else) it's probably not that big a deal. Breathe and take things
        one step at a time.
    -   If you find yourself unable to stay calm, excuse yourself and go
        somewhere private until you calm down.
3.  Act like you don't care. Like not getting too emotional, you should
    also give off an air of not caring. This will make you seem more
    classy and elegant. Getting overly excited or enthusiastic can
    easily make you seem child-like and
    immature.![](Be_Elegant_Step_18.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_18.jpg")
4.  Be polite to everyone you meet, whether you think they deserve it or
    not. Don't be passive-aggressive or sarcastic when things go wrong.
    Just get through all situations with perfect politeness. Treat
    everyone as if your grandmother were watching you and there was a
    nice piece of candy in it for
    you.![](Be_Elegant_Step_19.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_19.jpg")
5.  Be as graceful as you can be. Walk like a supermodel no matter where
    you are or how you're dressed. Take care not to fall or trip when
    walking in high heels. Don't try to dance above your skill level. If
    you want to improve your grace, then practice walking in heels, up
    and down stairs, etc. You can also practice your hand and leg
    movements in a full length
    mirror.![](Be_Elegant_Step_20.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_20.jpg")
6.  Be confident and act confident. Of course you don't have to actually
    be confident (for a lot of people, it's mostly an act) but act as
    confident as you can.[5] Tell yourself you're beautiful,
    intelligent, and that you know what you're doing...because you are
    and you do! Project confidence out to others by not constantly
    apologizing, for pursuing the things that you want, even if they
    aren't
    popular,![](Be_Elegant_Step_21.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_21.jpg")
7.  Have excellent manners. Real ladies have perfect manners. Practice
    good manners as you go about your day and especially when you eat.
    Don't ever burp or fart in public. Hold doors open for others and
    wait your turn for services. Drive courteously. And of course, eat
    without making a mess or being
    gross.![](Be_Elegant_Step_22.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_22.jpg")
8.  Be intelligent. Don't act dumb just for the sake of it. Sometimes
    people act dumb to stand out. While you may stand out that way, it
    won't be in a way you want! Be careful also not to act like you know
    everything about every subject. Talk about subjects you truly know
    about or say you don't know much about the topic. Your honesty will
    be
    appreciated.![](Be_Elegant_Step_23.jpg "fig:Be_Elegant_Step_23.jpg")

## Tips

-   Read books and the broadsheet newspapers to improve on language,
    grammar and vocabulary.
-   Learn about different cultures.
-   Travel extensively, if you can afford it.
-   Exercise regularly and appreciate your unique shape.
-   Think and speak well of others.
-   Try smiling more often because this helps you seem more friendly,
    approachable and positive. Smiling in a natural subtle way is one of
    the prominent and defining characteristics of elegant people.
-   Don't talk too much and don't try to fit in,try to differentiate
    yourself.
-   Educate yourself in at least the basics of the arts. For instance,
    Visual art is the most popular domain to be familiar with because
    intelligent and well thought-out conversations can easily be held
    surrounding the subject.
-   Being elegant is more of a personality trait than a fashion trend.
    Have good posture, be kind, help people and do everything from the
    good of your heart. Also, instead of saying sorry I took so long to
    reply to your message, say thank you for your patience, I admit I
    did take a while to reply to your message. Try not to be late, smile
    often, and when people are mean, bug them with your kindness, or
    laugh off all their insults, showing them you really couldn't care
    less. Treat all equally no matter what. People are more likely to
    notice this change than a change in you clothes.
