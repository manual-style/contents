Fairy Kei is a street fashion from Japan. It can be described as Kawaii
style meets 80s pop.

## Steps

1.  Colors. A basic Fairy Kei outfit uses a variety of pastel colors.
    However neon & darker colors can be incorporated in the
    outfit![](Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Get a poofy skirt. Tutus & Petticoats are the popular choice but you
    don't have to wear only those options! Ruffly skirts, plain cutoff
    denim skirts, patterned or plain miniskirts, colorful shorts, gauzy
    skirts, lacy skirts, overalls,
    etc.![](Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Add your 80's twist. Whether it be converse shoes, scrunchies,
    famous 80's characters like Care Bears or My Little Pony, fanny
    packs or even leggings. Always remember about adding an 80's
    twist.![](Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Add cute accessories, but not too many decorative levels. Cute hair
    bow, cute hair clips in fun colors, thick headbands, skinny
    headbands, cool eighties caps,
    etc.![](Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Style the hair. Hair can really be any style, but cutesy, childish
    hair is best. Maybe with a
    bow.![](Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Use leggings, socks or tights: Opt for some bright colored leggings,
    cute ankle socks or some simple colored tights. Maybe add small
    neutral colors like black or white. Remember legwarmers? Those are
    an option
    too!![](Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Add shoes. Converse are very popular in this style but there are
    many other options. Bright colored high top sneakers, Dr. Martens,
    pop colored heels and even UGGs can work with this
    style!![](Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_7.jpg "fig:Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Listen to music. The best part of Fairy Kei is the music. Popular
    choices are Riot Girl, Electroclash, 80's Pop icons such as Cindy
    Lauper, Madonna & Blondie just to name a few & of course Japan does
    have some underground bands & artists such as
    PEEP4U.![](Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_8.jpg "fig:Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Check 80's cartoons for ideas. 80's cartoons, like Strawberry
    Shortcake, My Little Pony, Care Bears, Rainbow Brite, Barbie, The
    Smurfs & Disney characters are very popular with Fairy
    Kei.![](Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_9.jpg "fig:Be_Fairy_Kei_Step_9.jpg")
