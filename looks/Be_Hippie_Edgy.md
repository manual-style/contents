Being hippie edgy is uber mega chic at the moment. A lot of top fashion
designers have the $200 hippie jeans and $500 leather jackets. But you
can do it on a budget. Here are some tips to look mega chic by pulling
off the edgy hippie look for a lot less.

## Steps

1.  Select the jeans. Doing this should be a no brainer. You need a pair
    of skinny jeans which would tie together an edgy look. But loose
    ripped jeans that hang loosely on your hips, is mega hippie. Ripped
    jeans whether they're skinny or bootcut, work. But clean cuts on the
    bottom of your jeans don't work. You can buy regular jeans and
    stitch on some cuts of fabrics and make them look

2.  Choose tees with funky logos. That's very hippie, but can also be
    edgy, as they're tight and show off your curves. The tee should not
    have sparkles or glitter or butterflies and unicorns. It can be
    funny or
    cool.![](Be_Hippie_Edgy_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Hippie_Edgy_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Get a leather jacket. But it doesn't have to be real. You can buy a
    whole variety of fake leather jackets in black and brown at stores
    like

4.  Layer. You have to layer your clothes. A white tee, a blue and green
    striped vest, a brown leather jacket, a gray scarf, a dark pair of
    jeans, a pair of black sandals, and a dark purple
    purse.![](Be_Hippie_Edgy_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Hippie_Edgy_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Wear Converse sneakers. Those are both edgy and hippie. They can be
    diff colors and have
    designs.![](Be_Hippie_Edgy_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_Hippie_Edgy_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Prepare your hair. Your hair could be moused up to make it look
    curly and tousled. The bed head look is recommended. Also, if you
    wash your hair at night, and braid small chunks of your hair all
    around your head and then take them out in the morning and then
    spray a bit of
    hairspray.![](Be_Hippie_Edgy_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_Hippie_Edgy_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Display the attitude. You have to be kind of bad a\*\* and risky and
    cool. Take risks and go to parties and jump fences with your
    friends.![](Be_Hippie_Edgy_Step_7.jpg "fig:Be_Hippie_Edgy_Step_7.jpg")

## Tips

-   You can occasionally wear a thin headband over your forehead to make
    you look hippie.
-   peace signs. Both totally edgy and hippie. Get any accessories
    and/or outfits with peace signs.

## Warnings

-   Don't do anything illegal or too dangerous to try to be edgy. You
    can be edgy by stuffing chicken into the coin slots of soda machines
    and jumping over the fence of the pool in your friends neighborhood
    to jump on the pool cover.
