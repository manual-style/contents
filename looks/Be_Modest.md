You don't have to be overly shy, quiet, or saintly to be modest. You
simply have to avoid showing off and know how to make other people feel
good about who *they* are. And along with being modest, you'll be pegged
as a good listener and down-to-earth to boot!

## Steps

### Avoiding Showing Off

1.  Don't brag about your accomplishments to everyone in your orbit. The
    first rule to being modest is to avoid bragging -- even if you've
    done something great. Maybe you finished the New York Marathon,
    maybe you got a new promotion, or maybe you just closed on an
    amazing new house. These are all great things and you should be
    proud of what you've done, but being modest is all about not showing
    off. You can share your successes if they come up, but don't rub
    them in anyone's
    face.![](Answer-Interview-Questions-Step-8-Version-2.jpg "fig:Answer-Interview-Questions-Step-8-Version-2.jpg")
    -   If someone mentions your new neighborhood, you can say, "I'm
        actually moving there next month." You don't have to say, "I
        just closed on an amazing new ten bedroom house with a sauna and
        a wine cellar."
    -   Running the New York Marathon is great. Be proud of what you did
        and don't be embarrassed to talk about it if it comes up. But
        don't say, "I beat almost everyone in my age group" or "It was
        so easy that I took a lap around Central Park after I crossed
        the finish line."
2.  Share your achievements only with the people who really care. You
    don't have to keep your successes completely to yourself to be
    modest. You just have to pick and choose who would really care about
    what you have to say, who really supports you, and who is really
    close to you and rooting for you to succeed. Maybe it's only your
    spouse, your mother, your best friend, or your small circle of
    friends. That's fine. It's better to tell one person who really
    cares than to brag to ten people who couldn't care
    less.![](Be-Mature-Step-10-Version-2.jpg "fig:Be-Mature-Step-10-Version-2.jpg")
    -   If you got a new promotion, don't brag to your other co-workers
        or you'll look like a jerk. But tell your spouse and family --
        they'll be proud of you.
    -   If you closed on a house, celebrate with your family and the
        close friends who will be hanging out there.
    -   If you ran your personal best in a marathon, tell your running
        buddies -- they'll be proud of you.
3.  Avoid talking about how much money you have. Talking about how rich
    you are, how much money you have, how much money you *will* have,
    how big of a raise you've got, or just anything that has to do with
    your general wealth is *not* modest. Talking about how much money
    you have makes you look self-obsessed and just plain annoys other
    people. You may be proud of the money you've earned, *if* you've
    earned it, and you can share your wealth with your family or anyone
    you support, but that does *not* mean perfect strangers will be
    happy to hear about your fat
    wallet.![](Choose-a-Recruitment-Agency-Step-14.jpg "fig:Choose-a-Recruitment-Agency-Step-14.jpg")
4.  Don't discuss your ten most amazing qualities. If you want to be
    modest, then don't mention how beautiful, awesome, smart, clever,
    outgoing, or whatever it is you are unless you want to be seriously
    annoying. Saying things like, "I know I'm a good looking guy" or "I
    know more about literature than anyone in this room" is just
    flat-out annoying, even if you really think these things are
    true.![](Pick-up-Girls-Step-10-Version-2.jpg "fig:Pick-up-Girls-Step-10-Version-2.jpg")
    -   If you have great qualities, then other people will notice them
        and will point out how amazing you are.
5.  Don't put yourself down too much, either. This may be confusing.
    First you're told not to build yourself up, but then you're told not
    to put yourself down? What gives? While you should avoid bragging
    about how amazing you are, if you put yourself down too much, then
    people will think you're putting on an act just so someone will stop
    and tell you how great you
    are.![](Be-a-Tough-Guy-Step-2-Version-3.jpg "fig:Be-a-Tough-Guy-Step-2-Version-3.jpg")
    -   If you say, "I'm the dumbest person in this class. I'll never
        get anything right," then people may think you just want to be
        told that you're one of the smartest.
    -   If you say, "I'm really terrible at..." people may think that
        you're purposefully saying that because you want to hear the
        opposite. This only works for things that you're pretty sure
        you're good at, of course.
6.  [Practice humility.](Be_Humble "wikilink") Being humble is a part of
    being modest. To be humble, you have to accept your limitations and
    know that there is a beautiful, infinite, complicated world out
    there and that you are not its master. Be in awe of nature, your
    surroundings, your mentors, and the world at large and see that you
    really aren't the best, brightest, hottest person who ever walked on
    the
    Earth.![](Help-the-Homeless-Step-7.jpg "fig:Help-the-Homeless-Step-7.jpg")
    -   Volunteer. This will make you appreciate how much you have to be
        thankful for.
    -   Acknowledge your faults. Truly humble people know that they
        aren't perfect.
    -   Admit that you're not the best at everything. You may think you
        are...but you're wrong.
7.  Don't share *too* much about your amazing relationship. Sure, you're
    on cloud nine with your new love affair, but does that mean that
    Lula, your sixty-year-old coworker who is going through a painful
    divorce, has to hear all about it? Keep the most special parts of
    your love to yourself instead of posting a million pictures of you
    making out with your special someone on Facebook, showing off the
    new necklace he gave you, or just talking about how you are *so* in
    love.![](Make-Your-Husband-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Again-Step-5-Version-2.jpg "fig:Make-Your-Husband-Fall-in-Love-with-You-Again-Step-5-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Unfortunately, many people out there are in unhappy
        relationships or are unhappy being single. There's no need to
        rub your happiness in their faces. In fact, that cheapens it.

### Making Others Feel Good

1.  Be aware of what you're worth in front of others. Studies show that
    to be modest, you have to be aware of how your accomplishments and
    qualities stack up in front of others. Only then can you realize
    that you have a lot to be thankful for and that you shouldn't go
    around making other people feel bad about it. If you know you look
    like a runway model, then don't complain about your stringy hair to
    other people; if you know you're the most talented actor in your
    studio, then don't talk about how insecure you
    feel.[1]![](Write-a-Journal-Step-3-Version-2.jpg "fig:Write-a-Journal-Step-3-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Write down the things you're good at. Be realistic -- how do you
        *really* stack up against others? Sure, you may not be
        completely happy in your career, relationship, or friendships,
        but think about how much you already have going for you.
    -   A lot of people are immodest because they don't realize how good
        they have it. They don't realize that they are bragging or
        complaining about the wrong thing because they may not see that
        they are better off than others.
2.  Realize what others have before you open your mouth. This has to do
    with knowing your audience. Make sure that you are not accidentally
    annoying or hurting other people with your careless comments. If
    you're in a great relationship, don't give your best friend all of
    the details if she's upset about not being able to find the right
    guy; if you're only having a minor setback at work, don't tell your
    unemployed brother all about it unless you want him to feel
    terrible.![](Interrogate-Someone-Step-9.jpg "fig:Interrogate-Someone-Step-9.jpg")
    -   Before you talk about something that is going great, or
        relatively not-so-great, in your life, look at who you're
        talking to. How is this person doing professionally or
        personally, and how would your statements make him feel?
    -   When you're talking to people you barely know, you should be
        even more discreet. Don't brag to someone when you have no idea
        where he is even coming from.
3.  Don't dominate a conversation. Immodest people are comfortable with
    talking the whole time, completely taking over a conversation, and
    often talking about themselves. Who wants to hear all about YOU
    24/7? Most likely, nobody at all. It's okay to chime in or to take
    over when you have something interesting to say, but if you can't
    seem to not let a conversation flow in your direction and start
    cutting people off to discuss what *you* have been up to, then
    you're lacking in the modesty
    department.![](Choose-a-Role-Model-Step-8.jpg "fig:Choose-a-Role-Model-Step-8.jpg")
    -   If you're just hanging out with another person, try to maintain
        a 50-50 balance so both of you have a say.
    -   If you're in a large group, wait for at least a few people to
        speak in between speaking yourself.
4.  Compliment other people. Part of being modest is recognizing the
    strengths of other people. If you're not modest, then you probably
    don't even realize that other people have so much to offer because
    you're so focused on you, you, you all the time. So, the next time
    you're hanging out with people, give them genuine compliments that
    show that you've put some thought into who they really
    are.![](Make-a-Boy-Blush-Step-11.jpg "fig:Make-a-Boy-Blush-Step-11.jpg")
    -   You can even compliment something small, like a friend's new
        shirt or piece of jewelry.
    -   You can also compliment a person's personality trait. Say,
        "You're just so hardworking," or "You're such a good listener."
5.  Give others credit for your achievements. Let's say you wrapped up
    an amazing project at work, but you did it with the help of others.
    When your boss thanks you for your killer work, what do you say? "I
    know, I worked my butt off!" Absolutely not. Instead, you say, "I
    couldn't have done it without Sarah and Michael. They were so
    helpful." This shows that you're aware of the hard work that others
    do and that you don't want to take all the credit for someone else's
    hard
    work.![](Be-Special-Step-4-Version-3.jpg "fig:Be-Special-Step-4-Version-3.jpg")
    -   This can go beyond the workplace. If someone compliments you on
        your hard work in math class, you can say that you wouldn't have
        been able to get such good grades if your best friend didn't run
        over the concepts with you.
6.  Disagree without making people feel bad. Being modest doesn't mean
    agreeing with what everyone says all of the time. But it does mean
    that you should know how to disagree with people without making them
    feel bad. If you just say, "You're wrong!" or "Let me tell you how
    it really is..." then people will think that you're stubborn, full
    of yourself, and not willing to listen to what other people have to
    say. Instead, [have an open mind](Be_Open-Minded "wikilink"), and
    know how to state your
    opinion.![](Get-a-Friend-Back-Step-7-Version-2.jpg "fig:Get-a-Friend-Back-Step-7-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Say something inoffensive like, "Maybe it's just me..." instead
        of violently disagreeing.
    -   Even if you completely disagree with someone, you should say
        things like, "I can see your side of it" or "I've never thought
        about it that way before." Don't make people feel bad unless you
        want them to think you're stuck up.
7.  Thank people for all of their help. Saying "thank you" and [showing
    gratitude](Be_Grateful "wikilink") can go a long way in making you
    look modest. If you're modest, then you should be thankful for all
    of the people who make your life better and who are there to support
    and help you no matter what. Make sure these people know how much
    they mean to you and that you remember to always thank them for what
    they do--or just
    because.![](Be-Mature-Step-26.jpg "fig:Be-Mature-Step-26.jpg")
    -   Get in the habit of saying "thank you" as much as you can,
        whether you're talking to your best friend or your repairman.
    -   Elaborate. Say, "thank you for helping me redecorate my house. I
        couldn't have done it without you."
    -   Get in the habit of writing thank-you cards. They can help you
        express gratitude.
8.  Accept compliments with grace. Another part of being modest is to
    know how to accept a true compliment. Don't say, "*That's* not
    true..." and then put yourself down. Instead, keep it simple. Just
    say something like, "Thank you, I really appreciate that you would
    say that." Let the person see that you've accepted the compliment
    and that you're not going to fight it and
    disagree.![](Be-Friends-with-Everyone-Step-9.jpg "fig:Be-Friends-with-Everyone-Step-9.jpg")
    -   You don't have to jump back and compliment the other person
        right away, either, or you may look insincere.

### Looking Modest

1.  Have modest body language. If you want to be modest, then you have
    to look the part. Don't hover over people, wave your hands wildly
    when you gesture, touch people you barely know with too much
    confidence, or stand with your hands on your hips and a giant
    maniacal smile planted on your face. Just stand with good posture,
    smile when the occasion calls for it, and keep your hands at your
    sides.![](Tell-a-Girl-You-Like-Her-Without-Getting-Rejected-Step-20.jpg "fig:Tell-a-Girl-You-Like-Her-Without-Getting-Rejected-Step-20.jpg")
    -   You don't have to hunch over or look at the ground to be modest.
        Just don't go so over the top with your body language that
        people think you're full of yourself.
2.  Walk into a room with modesty. If you're modest, then you shouldn't
    march right into a room like you own the place and start chatting
    away like the belle of the ball. Stride into a room with confidence,
    and calmly greet people or give them hugs, but don't show up and
    throw your hands in the air and cry, "The party's here!" The way you
    carry yourself, especially when you enter a new environment, can
    influence how modest you really
    look.![](Make-Friends-at-a-New-School-Step-1-Version-2.jpg "fig:Make-Friends-at-a-New-School-Step-1-Version-2.jpg")
3.  Dress with modesty. This doesn't mean that you should dress like you
    just arrived to America on the Mayflower. However, if you want to be
    modest, then you should avoid clothes that are too flashy and which
    draw too much attention to you. Wearing obscene graphic tees, neon
    colors, or zebra or leopard print patterns may not be your best bet.
    Wear something that accentuates your best features without putting
    it all out
    there.![](Be-Stylish-While-Being-Casual-Step-5.jpg "fig:Be-Stylish-While-Being-Casual-Step-5.jpg")
    -   Women should define what dressing with modesty means to them.
        There's no harm in showing off a little cleavage as long as
        you've got it under control.
4.  Avoid flashy accessories. Part of being modest means not acting *or
    looking* like you're better than everyone else. So, that $1000 Prada
    purse or those expensive diamond earrings may have to go if you want
    to look modest in front of other people. It's okay to own *some*
    nice things and to bring them out from time to time, but if you're
    rolling in with $5000 worth of electronics, jewelry, watches, shoes,
    and any other accessories that you can think of, then other people
    will raise their
    eyebrows.![](Pick-up-Girls-Step-12.jpg "fig:Pick-up-Girls-Step-12.jpg")
    -   Maybe you worked hard for that $1000 Prada purse. It's okay to
        wear it. But try not to flash it around and show it off, or
        people won't think you're very modest.
5.  Just remember not to look or be *too* modest. Modesty can be a
    positive trait that helps you gain friends, be respected at work,
    and improve your relationships. Just don't let people walk all over
    you because you're so busy being modest that you don't even get
    recognition for what you have achieved, and get overlooked in the
    workplace or the dating arena as a
    result.![](Treat-People-With-Respect-Step-5-Version-2.jpg "fig:Treat-People-With-Respect-Step-5-Version-2.jpg")
    -   There are contested debates over whether the "modest is
        hottest," mantra is a good one, or whether it keeps women from
        expressing who they really are. When you decide on your level of
        modesty, think carefully.[2][3]

## Tips

-   If you really want people to notice something about you, or if you
    really want to talk about a problem you have, lead them on modestly.
    If you changed your appearance say something like "Notice anything
    different about me?" And don't get mad if they say no. If you want
    to talk about you, or a problem you have, just start the
    conversation(but do not interrupt another one) if you are modest,
    and a good person, they'll help you or talk about that new thing you
    bought or that thing you did over the weekend. But don't drone on
    and on. Make it a short conversation, and if it leads into another
    topic other than you, don't try to pull it back to you, or bring it
    up again and again.

## Warnings

-   If people are rolling their eyes or getting annoyed, or if you're
    talking about yourself, and everyone looks bored, and no one is
    contributing to the conversation, then end it, and talk about
    someone or something else.
