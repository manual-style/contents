Modesty generally refers to decent, unassuming behavior. It is typically
marked by a humble attitude and a desire to show kindness towards
others. Whether you're interested in being more modest for religious
reasons or simply want to live a more restrained lifestyle, you can
become more modest by changing your attitude, living within your means,
and conforming to prescribed modes of dress and behavior.

## Steps

### Cultivating a Modest Attitude

1.  Have a healthy, realistic impression of yourself. Being modest
    begins with how you see yourself and your place in the world. By
    being aware of your own strengths and weaknesses, you can avoid the
    pitfalls of arrogance and start to live more
    modestly.[1]![](Be-Single-and-Happy-Step-11.jpg "fig:Be-Single-and-Happy-Step-11.jpg")
    -   Try to see yourself the way others see you by asking your
        closest friends how they perceive you. Ask about both the good
        and the bad, and let your friends know you'd like a fair and
        honest assessment.
    -   Acknowledge your good qualities and your positive
        accomplishments, but don't let these things inflate your ego or
        define your life.
2.  Seek out advice and constructive criticism. A modest person is
    defined by his or her humility. If you're trying to live more
    modestly, you should accept the fact that you do not know everything
    about yourself, and that you may need advice and guidance from
    others.[2]![](Get-a-Friend-Back-Step-7-Version-2.jpg "fig:Get-a-Friend-Back-Step-7-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Accept that you may be wrong from time to time. Remember that
        there's nothing wrong with this; no one is perfect, and no one
        can be right all of the time.[3]
    -   Don't interrupt when someone is criticizing you or giving you
        advice. You may be tempted to defend yourself, but by listening
        actively you'll learn a great deal about yourself.
    -   Don't dismiss the criticism others offer you, but don't accept
        or believe it all at face value. Ask other people who know you
        if they've noticed similar patterns of behavior, and assess your
        need to improve while keeping your ego in check.
3.  Resist the urge to brag about yourself. Another facet of humility is
    personal restraint. Modest people do not brag about their wealth or
    accomplishments, and they don't let these things define them. That
    doesn't necessarily mean that you should hide anything about
    yourself; it simply means that you shouldn't boast about
    anything.[4]![](Pick-up-Girls-Step-10-Version-2.jpg "fig:Pick-up-Girls-Step-10-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Telling a new acquaintance in conversation about something
        significant that you've done isn't necessarily bragging if it's
        relevant to the conversation.
    -   Telling someone about your accomplishments repeatedly, or
        reminding someone who already knows about them, could be seen as
        bragging.
4.  Accept compliments without an ego. A modest person should not let
    compliments get to his or her head. You can accept a compliment
    graciously, but you should not let it feed into your ego or make you
    think that you're better than
    others.[5]![](Talk-to-a-Guy-Step-2-Version-3.jpg "fig:Talk-to-a-Guy-Step-2-Version-3.jpg")
    -   Recognize that everyone has strengths and weaknesses, but don't
        let those qualities define you or anyone else.
    -   If someone compliments one of your strengths, you can practice
        being modest by thanking that person and complimenting them on
        one of their strengths.
5.  Strive for selflessness. A modest person puts the needs of others
    ahead of his or her own needs. That doesn't mean forcing yourself to
    suffer; it simply means being considerate of others and fostering a
    desire to help others in some
    way.[6]![](Love-Your-Girlfriend-Step-10-Version-3.jpg "fig:Love-Your-Girlfriend-Step-10-Version-3.jpg")
    -   Be kind to others and think about whether their needs are being
        met.
    -   You may find that it is ultimately more important and more
        rewarding to elevate others than to try to elevate yourself.

### Living a Modest Lifestyle

1.  Live within your means. The key to living a modest lifestyle is
    living within your means. That means avoiding extravagance and
    settling for the basics. You don't have to deprive yourself to live
    modestly - you just have to value function and practicality over
    luxurious status
    symbols.[7]![](Build-Self-Worth-Step-12.jpg "fig:Build-Self-Worth-Step-12.jpg")
    -   Drive a car that is safe, comfortable, and works well. Don't
        choose a car for its flashiness or status value.
    -   Buy or rent a home that is sturdy, comfortable, and in a safe
        neighborhood. If you only need two bedrooms then don't rent or
        buy a place with three bedrooms.
    -   Find out the average cost to purchase a home in your area and
        try to work within that price range (if it fits your budget).
2.  Buy used or discount items whenever possible. One easy way to live a
    more modest lifestyle is to buy items that are used or discounted
    instead of paying full price. This can help you save on the basics
    when you're at the store. Look for items on sale, discount, or
    clearance when you're at a retail store. You can also check thrift
    stores for gently-used items available at a fraction of the cost of
    new
    items.![](Attract-Girls-Without-Talking-to-Them-Step-1-Version-2.jpg "fig:Attract-Girls-Without-Talking-to-Them-Step-1-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Gently-used items are often in like-new condition. You can find
        these at thrift stores, consignment shops, and pawn shops.
    -   Many clothing stores put out-of-season garments on clearance.
        These can typically be purchased at a very low cost.
    -   Check stores that are going out of business, as they often have
        good deals to move products out the door.
3.  Try not to worry about whether others are impressed. Living modestly
    and humbly means emphasizing your values ahead of the opinions of
    others. Don't trouble yourself wondering whether others are
    impressed with you or with your possessions. Instead, focus on
    living a meaningful and upstanding
    life.[8]![](Be-Patient-Step-5-Version-4.jpg "fig:Be-Patient-Step-5-Version-4.jpg")

### Dressing and Behaving More Modestly

1.  Wear clothing that is not revealing. Many religious and cultural
    institutions encourage people to dress modestly. The goal of
    dressing modestly is to provide a good, morally-sound influence to
    the people you interact
    with.[9]![](Be-Attractive-Step-10-Version-2.jpg "fig:Be-Attractive-Step-10-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Generally speaking, modest clothing is any article of clothing
        that is not sexually suggestive and does not show off the body.
    -   This means avoiding any clothing that reveals too much skin, and
        it may also entail avoiding clothes that are tight-fitting.
2.  Avoid extremes in appearance. Modest dress may also include a
    general avoidance of extremes, depending on one's culture. This may
    mean being neatly groomed and manicured, conforming to prescribed
    fashion trends, and abstaining from getting tattoos or
    piercings.[10]![](Be-a-Mean-Girl-Step-11.jpg "fig:Be-a-Mean-Girl-Step-11.jpg")
    -   Someone who wants to live modestly and also wants to have
        pierced ears may find that a single pair of plain earrings will
        accommodate both desires.
3.  Use language that is positive and uplifting. Modest speech means
    refraining from vulgarity or negative language. Instead, a modest
    speaker should strive to be a positive role model for others and
    should try to make others feel
    happy.[11]![](Attract-a-Girl-Step-9.jpg "fig:Attract-a-Girl-Step-9.jpg")
    -   Don't use swear words.
    -   If you're trying to be modest for spiritual purposes you should
        also avoid blasphemous language.
    -   Ask yourself whether the things you say would inspire and uplift
        others, or them feel uncomfortable or upset.

## Tips

-   Respect the beliefs that other people hold. Don't expect others to
    conform to your way of life, and don't judge other people for living
    in a way that makes them happy.
-   Be patient with yourself. It's hard to change old habits, and it may
    take you a while to figure out how to implement a more modest
    approach to your life.
