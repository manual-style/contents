Refined people are known for their elegance, subtlety, and social tact.
If you want to be refined, then it’s not about acting like aristocracy,
but about making a point of treating other people with respect while
maintaining a sophisticated image. People who are refined tend to avoid
bad habits, such as speaking too loudly, gossiping, or belching in
public. If you want to be refined, you simply have to focus on
projecting confidence, poise, and grace in your words and actions.

## Steps

### Talking the Talk

1.  Keep it simple. You don’t need to spout of a list of facts or quote
    the entire Sunday paper in order to impress people with how refined
    you are. In fact, when it comes to being refined, less is more. You
    should say what’s on your mind in a succinct and clear way that
    leaves little up to doubt. Don’t bog your peers or strangers down in
    facts or in an effort to show off; instead, state your opinions
    briefly and confidently, and you’ll be showing that you’re a refined
    person who doesn’t need to ramble on to make a point.
    ![](401161_1.jpg "fig:401161_1.jpg")
    -   You don’t need to speak in long, elaborate sentences to try to
        impress people. Short, concise sentences with clear words are
        best.[1]
    -   You also don’t need to use million-dollar words to make your
        points, either. It’s better if everyone can understand you.
2.  Slow down. Refined people are never in a rush because they’re
    sophisticated enough to give themselves time to do everything they
    want to do. They don’t rush to dinner, they don’t speak too fast,[2]
    and they don’t rifle around their purses at top speed to find
    something because they already know that everything is in place. If
    you want to be refined, then you should work on moving in a
    confident, precise manner instead of moving fast, talking fast, and
    acting fast. ![](401161_2.jpg "fig:401161_2.jpg")
    -   Instead of speaking fast and saying “um” and “like” every two
        seconds to fill the pauses,[3] practice talking more slowly and
        really thinking before you speak so you can avoid using those
        conversational fillers.[4]
3.  Avoid cursing.[5] Though refined people do get their feathers
    ruffled on occasion, they tend to keep their cool in public.
    Therefore, they avoid cursing when they get upset or saying anything
    untoward in the heat of the moment. In fact, they generally avoid
    being vulgar by mentioning sex, going to the bathroom, or any other
    subjects that are likely to be distasteful to some people. This
    doesn’t mean that refined people are boring, but that they’re just
    classy. Cursing is a sign of bad breeding and refined people avoid
    it at all costs. ![](401161_3.jpg "fig:401161_3.jpg")
    -   If you do lose your cool and curse, however, just apologize.
4.  Excuse yourself if you belch or pass gas. Nobody can be refined all
    the time, and sometimes, our bodies betray us and make noises that
    make other people giggle. It’s okay if you find yourself belching
    after a meal or passing gas, but the best thing to do, if you want
    to be refined, is to politely excuse yourself instead of pretending
    like nothing happened. Swallow your pride and do this and you’ll be
    projecting refinement in no time.[6]
    ![](401161_4.jpg "fig:401161_4.jpg")
    -   Just a simple “pardon me” before moving on is perfectly fine.
5.  Avoid slang. Though you don’t have to talk like Prince William, you
    should avoid using too much slang in your conversation if you want
    to sound refined. Avoid colloquialisms like “ya’ll” “you guys,” or
    “hella,” if you want to sound like a refined person who is cultured
    and well-mannered. Be aware of the regional phrases you use, or
    which terms come from pop culture, and try to find a way around them
    when you can. Refined people speak in a way that is timeless, not
    based on popular terms, such as “BFF” or “selfie.”[7]
    ![](401161_5.jpg "fig:401161_5.jpg")
    -   Of course, if everyone around you uses a ton of slang, you don’t
        want to stand out completely by using proper language, but you
        should avoid slang as much as possible to sound refined.
6.  Avoid vulgar conversational topics. If you want to be refined, then
    you should avoid talking about anything that can be viewed as
    offensive, especially if you find yourself in mixed company.
    Remember that something that might go over well with your best
    friend may not work well in a crowd; avoid talking about sex, body
    parts, using the bathroom, or any statements that may be seen as
    offensive or off-color that relate to politics. It’s better to
    assume that the people around you can be easily offended than to
    make what you think is an innocent joke that ends up really hurting
    a person’s feelings. To be refined, you can still discuss
    interesting topics while making sure that you’re not scandalizing
    anyone.[8] ![](401161_6.jpg "fig:401161_6.jpg")
    -   If someone else brings up a vulgar topic that you’re not
        comfortable with, you can also do your best to steer the
        conversation in a direction that makes you feel more
        comfortable.
7.  Think before you speak.[9] Refined people rarely say something that
    is thoughtless or offensive and don’t often find themselves
    apologizing for misspeaking because they’ve thought everything
    through. They don’t blurt out the first thing that comes to their
    heads and stop to ask themselves how the comment would be received
    and if their intentions would be clear before they said anything.
    Refined people literally take the time to “refine” their words
    before they say them, so that they are said with elegance and
    grace.![](401161_7.jpg "fig:401161_7.jpg")
    -   Before you say something, look at the person you’re talking to
        and think about whether the statement would make the person
        upset, or, if you’re in a large group, if the statement would be
        better made privately.
8.  Give compliments. You don’t have to give fake compliments you don’t
    believe in just to sound refined, but you should work on making
    people feel special when they deserve it.[10] The art of giving a
    compliment is a difficult one to master, and once you learn how to
    compliment a person’s important traits without overstepping your
    bounds, you’ll be on your way to sounding even more refined than
    ever. Refined people also have an eye for detail and are quick to
    notice a new piece of jewelry or footwear that is truly worth
    complimenting. ![](401161_8.jpg "fig:401161_8.jpg")
    -   To sound truly refined, you can say something like, “That’s the
        most exquisite scarf I’ve ever seen” instead of, “Oh my god,
        what an awesome scarf!”
9.  Don’t speak too loudly. Refined people are confident that what they
    say will be heard because they’ve chosen their words carefully.
    Speaking so loud that the person across the restaurant can hear
    every word you say is a sign of bad breeding, as well as a lack of
    respect toward others. Make sure you modulate your voice when you
    talk to people, and wait to grab their attention instead of speaking
    so loudly that they are forced to listen.[11]
    ![](401161_9.jpg "fig:401161_9.jpg")
    -   Don’t loudly interrupt people to try to get your point across,
        either. Wait your turn if you want to be refined.[12]

### Acting Refined

1.  Avoid gossiping.[13] People who are refined have opinions, but they
    tend to keep them to themselves when they involve other people in a
    negative light. If you want to be refined, then you should be above
    gossiping about other people, starting rumors, or asking if your two
    co-workers or classmates are hooking up. If you have the reputation
    of being a gossip, then people won’t think of you as refined at all;
    instead, they’ll see you as an unsophisticated, immature person. To
    be truly refined, you should be positive if you plan on talking
    about a person who isn’t in the room.
    ![](401161_10.jpg "fig:401161_10.jpg")
    -   Instead, practice saying nice things about people “behind their
        backs.” Say nice things about people who aren’t in the room and
        it will get back to them.
2.  Be agreeable. Refined people don’t pick fights with people and don’t
    make a big deal about it if they disagree with something. They are
    still comfortable stating their opinions, but they don’t do so to
    make other people feel bad or to look superior. If you find someone
    challenging your ideas when you’re having a conversation, then you
    should be polite about disagreeing, and not resort to name calling.
    Refined people should be easy to get along with, and are easygoing
    and tend to go with the flow instead of being prickly or
    confrontational.[14] ![](401161_11.jpg "fig:401161_11.jpg")
    -   If you’re asked to settle an argument and know the answer — lets
        say people are debating about whether a quote is attributed to
        The Bible or Shakespeare — then it’s best to say you’re not sure
        of the answer even if you do. There’s no need to cause conflict.
    -   If someone is trying to tell you your opinions are worthless, do
        not engage. Take the high road and exit the conversation instead
        of being determined to prove the person wrong.
3.  Don’t brag. Refined people are knowledgeable and interesting, but
    they don’t need to brag to make it known. Even if you’ve memorized
    every scene in every Goddard film or speak eight foreign languages,
    you shouldn’t go telling everyone you know. Instead, wait for your
    areas of interest to come up in conversation so that people can be
    impressed by how much you know instead of thinking you’re obnoxious
    for showing off. When you share what you do know, don’t act like an
    authority but just casually mention the information in a friendly
    way instead.[15] ![](401161_12.jpg "fig:401161_12.jpg")
    -   You should praise people on their achievements as often as you
        can instead of harping on your own.
    -   If you’ve really accomplished a lot, then people will hear about
        it. If they mention it, be modest instead of acting like yeah,
        you know you’re pretty great.
4.  Keep refined company. If you really want to be refined, then it’s
    important for you to spend time with like-minded people. Refined
    people spend time with other people they can talk to about politics,
    wine, traveling, other cultures, foreign films, cultural events in
    their areas, and other subjects of interest. They don’t spend time
    with too many people who can’t contribute much to a conversation or
    who don’t listen to anything other than Top 40 and watch Judge Judy
    for a cultural good time. They tend to be friends with people who
    can stimulate them and encourage them to be even better than they
    are. ![](401161_13.jpg "fig:401161_13.jpg")
    -   Though it’s not refined to completely ditch someone in your
        circle because you think that person makes you look bad, you
        should think about the company you keep. If you think you spend
        too much time with people who are vulgar, lack class, and who
        bring you down, then it’s time to reconsider those
        relationships.
5.  Avoid dominating conversations. People who are refined have
    interesting opinions about politics, sports, cuisine, wine, and
    other subjects, but they try to avoid being a bore and talking about
    them all night long. They also tend to avoid being self-absorbed and
    talking about themselves incessantly. They’d prefer to talk about
    other people or about interesting world matters instead. It’s not
    refined to do 90% of the talking in a conversation, no matter how
    interesting you may think you
    are.[16]![](401161_14.jpg "fig:401161_14.jpg")
    -   If you’ve noticed that you’re dominating a conversation, switch
        gears and ask the people you’re with light questions, from what
        they’re doing this weekend to what their favorite sports team
        is.
6.  Have good manners. Good manners are a sign of refinement. In order
    to have good manners, you’ll need to eat with your mouth closed,
    avoid cursing, wait your turn, hold doors and pull out chairs for
    people, and generally conduct yourself in an admirable fashion.
    People with good manners are sensitive to the needs of others and
    make sure other people, whether they are guests or serving you
    coffee, are feeling comfortable. Ask people how they are, respect
    their space, and avoid making a mess if you want to have good
    manners.![](401161_15.jpg "fig:401161_15.jpg")
    -   Be polite.[17] Always greet people in a friendly fashion,
        introduce yourself to people you don’t know if they join a
        conversation, and avoid being unnecessarily rude to people even
        if you think they deserve it.
7.  Be cultured. You don’t have to speak seventeen languages to be
    cultured, but it does help to know something about other cultures,
    whether it’s knowing how to correctly pronounce “foie gras” when you
    order at a French restaurant, or you know that, in certain cultures,
    it’s polite to remove your shoes when you enter a person’s house.
    There’s no one way to suddenly become cultured, but you can make an
    effort to get to know how people live in other parts of the world,
    to watch foreign films, sample the cuisines of other countries, and
    most importantly, avoid having the attitude that everything is done
    the “right way” in your country.[18]
    ![](401161_16.jpg "fig:401161_16.jpg")
    -   Make a point of attending cultural events in your area, whether
        there are local theatres or museum openings.
    -   Read, read, read. Become knowledgeable on everything from
        ancient philosophy to contemporary poetry. Refined people tend
        to be very [well-read](Be_Well-Read "wikilink").
8.  [Be tactful.](Be_Tactful "wikilink") Refined people speak with
    extreme tact and understand that they have to choose their words and
    timing carefully when it comes to saying something. They don’t
    overstep their bounds and get too friendly with people they don’t
    know that well, they deflect negative comments from others, and they
    are able to be discreet when it’s necessary. They are masters at
    being gracious and don’t make people feel embarrassed in public.[19]
    ![](401161_17.jpg "fig:401161_17.jpg")
    -   Have a sense of a person’s sense of humor before you try to make
        a joke.
    -   Avoid mentioning how much money you make or asking about a
        person’s salary. That is seen as crude and not tactful at all.
    -   If someone has something in his teeth, for example, a tactful
        person would try to tell him privately.
    -   Tactful people also know that timing is important. You may be
        excited to announce that you’re pregnant, but you should see
        that you should avoid doing this when your friend is gushing
        about her engagement.

### Looking the Part

1.  Wear elegant, well-maintained clothes. Refined people take great
    care with their dress because they understand that an appearance of
    refinement is crucial to forming their refined persona. They pick
    clothes that are flattering, that match the season, that aren’t too
    revealing, and that look good together. Their clothes are tucked in,
    free of stains, and appropriate for the season. They tend to wear
    clothes with subtle colors, such as greys, browns, and blues, and
    don’t call too much attention to themselves with their
    dress.[20]![](401161_18.jpg "fig:401161_18.jpg")
    -   Refined people also tend to dress more elegant than most; men
        often wear suits or business casual wear even if in occasion
        doesn’t call for it, and refined women tend to wear dresses and
        heels along with tasteful jewelry.
    -   Your clothes don’t have to be expensive for you to look refined.
        You just have to make sure they fit well, match, and are free of
        wrinkles.
    -   Excessive shiny jewelry or accessories won’t make you look more
        refined. In fact, just one subtle watch or pair of silver
        earrings will do the trick and will be far better than looking
        flashy.
    -   Refined people tend to avoid graphic tee shirts or anything else
        that would make people laugh.
2.  Groom yourself. People who are refined take the time to comb their
    hair and make sure that they never look unkempt. Refined men tend to
    shave their faces or to maintain a very well-manicured beard.
    Refined people also generally look neat, clean, and like they put
    time and effort into their appearance. If you want to be refined,
    then you have to make a point of grooming yourself so that you are
    presentable when you step out.[21]
    ![](401161_19.jpg "fig:401161_19.jpg")
    -   Make a habit of carrying a comb and using it in private when
        necessary.
    -   Women can wear subtle makeup, but they should avoid going
        over-the-top or they won’t look very refined. Just some subtle
        lipstick, a bit of mascara, and some light eye shadow will do
        the trick.
3.  Maintain proper hygiene. If you want to be refined, then you should
    shower daily, wash your hair every day or at least every other day,
    wear deodorant (if you believe in it), and add some cologne or a
    light perfume into the mix if you like the effect. You should also
    brush your teeth at least twice a day and generally make sure that
    you smell nice and clean and look fresh anywhere you go. It’s hard
    to look refined if you have greasy hair and smell like B.O. Along
    with grooming yourself, maintaining proper hygiene is an important
    aspect of being refined.[22] ![](401161_20.jpg "fig:401161_20.jpg")
4.  Have refined body language. Refined people know how to carry
    themselves. They stand up straight and maintain good posture even
    when they’re sitting.[23] They keep their hands respectably folded
    across their legs when they sit and avoid putting their elbows on a
    table when they dine. They don’t slouch, fidget, or pick their noses
    in public. In general, they act respectful toward their own bodies
    as well as the people around them. To be refined, have body language
    that shows you have self-respect without making yourself too much at
    home anywhere you go.[24]![](401161_21.jpg "fig:401161_21.jpg")
    -   Avoid sitting with your legs spread wide, because this can be
        seen as a bit vulgar.
    -   Avoid scratching yourself in public. If you have an itch you
        really have to scratch, you’ll be better off scratching it in
        the bathroom.
    -   When you talk to people, stand at a respectable distance away
        from them. Close-talkers tend not to be refined.
5.  Smile and make eye contact. You may have an image of a refined
    person as a snob who would sooner turn his nose up at a new person
    than smile or make eye contact, but people who are truly refined
    know that other people deserve to be treated with respect. Making
    eye contact with people and smiling when you meet them or approach
    them is a common courtesy and shows them that you look at them as
    individuals who are worthy of your time.[25] Eye contact also shows
    people that you have their attention, which is very respectful and
    refined.[26]![](401161_22.jpg "fig:401161_22.jpg")
    -   Avoid checking your phone or texting when you’re talking to
        people and focus on the eye contact instead. Not paying
        attention to people is not very refined.
6.  Greet people in a refined manner. If you want to be refined, then
    you should treat people with respect when they come up to you. Don’t
    be too lazy to stand up to shake the hand of a new acquaintance or
    to introduce yourself by name. If a person you already know is
    approaching, it’s still polite to stand to greet that person if you
    want to be refined. If you just lift a hand and say, “hey,” then you
    may be seen as being a bit socially lazy, which is a sign of a lack
    of refinement. ![](401161_23.jpg "fig:401161_23.jpg")
    -   It’s also polite to repeat the person’s name if you meet him or
        her for the first time. You can say something like, “It’s great
        to finally meet you, Jason.”

## Tips

-   Do not look moody, look pleasant.
-   This 'refined' personality is unrealistic for 24/7 use or with close
    family and friends. You can be like this on a regular basis; but
    with those close to you be more open (still polite though). This way
    your 'refined' persona will not seem fake but like a wall you put
    out on your exterior in front of those you don't know too well. Not
    only will this make you not seem like a fraud; but make people more
    intrigued with the 'unguarded' you and more eager to learn more of
    you

## Warnings

-   It may get lonely if you can't get the persona correct. This
    personality gets a lot of admiration but not always a flank of
    friends.
-   Some may call you arrogant, but that is simply due to the fact that
    they are jealous.
