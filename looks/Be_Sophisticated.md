Sophistication means more than just smoking a thin cigarette in a French
café while discussing your latest trip to an art gallery. Sophistication
is a style, a mindset, and a way of life. So how do you become
sophisticated? Just follow these steps.

## Steps

### Getting the Look

1.  Master sophisticated body language. If you want to be sophisticated,
    then you have to master sophisticated body language so other people
    are instantly impressed when they see the way you carry yourself.
    Sophisticated people are confident, in charge, and calm, so make
    sure you’re never walking too fast, wildly searching through your
    bag for a lost item, or generally acting in a way that makes you
    look frazzled and unsure of yourself. If you want to look
    sophisticated, then the movements of your body have to be measured
    and calm. Here are some other things you can
    try:![](Be-More-Attractive-to-Men-Step-18-Version-2.jpg "fig:Be-More-Attractive-to-Men-Step-18-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Make eye contact slowly but surely. Don’t stare at people you’re
        not talking to or avert your gaze from people who are speaking
        to you.
    -   Avoid fidgeting with your hands. Keep them at your sides if
        you’re standing or fold them on your lap if you’re sitting.
    -   Maintain good posture by keeping your back and neck straight and
        looking ahead of you instead of down at the floor. It’s not
        sophisticated to slouch or hunch over.
2.  Have a sophisticated haircut. Part of being sophisticated is
    mastering the look. Make sure you get your hair cut every two months
    or so and that you update your haircut at least yearly so that
    you’re continuing to be current and trendy with your look. You don’t
    have to follow every trend you see, but you should make sure you
    look fresh and stylish, and not appear to be rocking the same
    haircut for the last
    decade.![](Cut-Hair-in-Layers-Step-11-Version-2.jpg "fig:Cut-Hair-in-Layers-Step-11-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Mix it up. If you normally have super long hair, go for a short
        bob and see how it fits your personality. Part of being
        sophisticated is being willing to embrace new things without
        following trends too closely.
    -   Consider getting highlights in your hair if you think it’ll
        enhance your look—but only if you can afford to get it
        professionally done.
    -   If you’re thinking about covering up your gray hairs, make sure
        it’s something you really want. Having a hint of gray in your
        hair or even rocking a salt and pepper look can actually make
        you look more sophisticated.
3.  Keep your face looking sophisticated. Both men and women should keep
    their faces looking sophisticated and well-groomed. Here’s what they
    should do:
    ![](Conceal-Red-Spots-on-Your-Face-Step-11.jpg "fig:Conceal-Red-Spots-on-Your-Face-Step-11.jpg")
    -   Women should wear some makeup to show that they’ve made an
        effort, but not so much that they end up hiding their natural
        features. Just a touch of eye shadow and liner and lipstick or
        lip gloss will do; there’s no need to throw on fake eyelashes or
        layers of blush.[1]
    -   Men should keep their faces looking fresh, but they can keep
        their beards or just a little bit of stubble. You don’t have to
        be free of facial hair to look sophisticated. A beard can even
        make you look more sophisticated, especially if you have some
        gray in your beard.
4.  Dress with style. Wearing classy clothes is a must if you want to be
    sophisticated. You should aim to be a little overdressed for any
    occasion, whether you’re taking an exam or going to a friend’s
    birthday party. This doesn’t mean you should show up to a casual
    event in a ball gown, but it does mean that you should aim to look
    about 10% more dressy than the people around you. This subtle
    difference will make you stand out as the more sophisticated person
    in a crowd.[2] ![](Dress-Up-Step-27.jpg "fig:Dress-Up-Step-27.jpg")
    -   Your clothes don’t have to be expensive, but they do have to be
        well cared for. Make sure you keep your clothes fresh,
        unstained, and free of wrinkles.
    -   Go for simple clothes, such as shirts and sweaters with solid
        colors or stripes instead of clothes with intricate patterns or
        graphic tees with witty comments on them.
    -   You don’t need a large wardrobe, either. Just a few key items,
        like black jeans or a white T-shirt, can go a long way in
        creating a simple yet elegant wardrobe.
5.  Accessorize with class. Accessories can help complete your
    sophisticated look once you’ve figured out your wardrobe and general
    appearance. The key is not to overdo it by throwing on tons of
    accessories at once. Just a few key items can help give your outfit
    a sophisticated touch.[3] Here are some things to
    try:![](Get-a-New-Look-Step-5-Version-2.jpg "fig:Get-a-New-Look-Step-5-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Simple black sunglasses
    -   Solid-colored belts
    -   Scarves
    -   A watch
    -   Simple gold and silver jewelry (for women)

### Talking the Talk

1.  Discuss sophisticated subjects. If you want to be sophisticated,
    then you have to be prepared to discuss sophisticated subjects and
    to avoid the less classy subjects whenever you can. Be prepared to
    discuss current events, politics, literature, art, cultural events,
    or anything that shows that you’re a well-rounded individual who is
    aware of what is going on in the world. Being sophisticated is about
    more than just the look—your words have to show that you’re
    sophisticated, too.[4]
    ![](Work-With-Your-Ex-Step-13.jpg "fig:Work-With-Your-Ex-Step-13.jpg")
    -   You don’t have to artificially insert sophisticated subjects
        into a conversation if the people around you are discussing
        something completely different. But if you naturally bring up a
        sophisticated subject or if the people around you are already
        discussing something sophisticated, you have to be prepared to
        jump in.
    -   If you’ve recently travelled somewhere or have read something
        interesting about another culture, you can share this
        information with other people. Just make sure that you don’t end
        up boring them with information that sounds irrelevant.
    -   Here are some sophisticated subjects: museums, good wine,
        foreign cultures and languages, travel experiences, political
        movements, philosophy, literature, and film.
2.  Avoid discussing any subjects that make people uncomfortable.
    Knowing what not to say is just as important as knowing what you
    should not talk about. Though you shouldn’t completely censor
    yourself and end up sounding like another person, if you want to
    sound sophisticated, then you have to avoid discussing subjects that
    make people cringe, roll their eyes, or generally feel like leaving
    the room. Here are some subjects that you should avoid talking about
    if you want to sound
    sophisticated:![](Work-With-Your-Ex-Step-4.jpg "fig:Work-With-Your-Ex-Step-4.jpg")
    -   How much money you make
    -   Bodily functions
    -   Your latest hookup
    -   How drunk you got last night
3.  Learn to speak more than one language. Don’t go out and teach
    yourself French just for the sake of being sophisticated, but do
    know that if you really want to be sophisticated, then you have to
    be [open-minded](Be_Open-Minded "wikilink") and to have some
    knowledge about other cultures and the way that people in different
    countries live their lives; the easiest way to do this is to master
    a foreign language. This will take time, but it will definitely make
    you look more
    sophisticated.![](Say-Happy-in-Spanish-Step-11.jpg "fig:Say-Happy-in-Spanish-Step-11.jpg")
    -   Study abroad for a semester or during a summer program.
        Immersion is a great way to learn a foreign language.
    -   Take lessons from a language tutor, or ask a friend who speaks a
        foreign language to tutor you in exchange for another favor on
        your end.
    -   Learning a language is about learning more than just a series of
        words and expressions. It’s about learning how another group of
        people live their lives.
4.  Avoid coarse language. If you want to be sophisticated, then you
    have to resist the urge to curse like a sailor. You should also
    avoid using any overly vulgar language, referring to your private
    parts, or discussing anyone else’s body in a rude manner. If you
    want to show that your thoughts are sophisticated, you can’t go
    around cursing in between every other sentence. Stay conscious of
    the words you use and make sure you avoid anything that is too
    offensive or that makes you sound like a thirteen-year-old boy.[5]
    ![](Get-Revenge-on-Anyone-Step-6-Version-2.jpg "fig:Get-Revenge-on-Anyone-Step-6-Version-2.jpg")
    -   If you do accidentally use a rude term, apologize or excuse
        yourself. It’s okay to admit that you’ve made a mistake, but
        don't make a fuss about it.
5.  Improve your vocabulary. Truly sophisticated people have a versatile
    vocabulary and are able to produce the perfect word for any
    situation. If you want to be sophisticated, then you have to add
    more words than “good” and “bad” to your repertoire of adjectives,
    and you have to be able to describe things in sophisticated,
    erudite, and thoughtful language. Here are some great ways to
    improve your
    vocabulary:![](Memorize-Notes-for-a-Test-Step-18.jpg "fig:Memorize-Notes-for-a-Test-Step-18.jpg")
    -   Do crosswords
    -   Spend time with people who speak using elevated language
    -   Read, read, read
    -   Watch sophisticated films
    -   Look up any words you don’t know
6.  Have sophisticated debates. Sophisticated people are able to engage
    in healthy, friendly debates that don’t turn ugly. If you find
    yourself in a disagreement with a person, act kind, polite, and
    non-accusatory as you continue to argue the finer points of arts,
    politics, or whatever it is you disagree about. Don’t resort to
    name-calling or anger in the middle of a debate; instead, use your
    knowledge to prove your point and never make the other person feel
    smaller than or dumber than
    you.![](Develop-a-Culture-of-Continuous-Improvement-Step-11.jpg "fig:Develop-a-Culture-of-Continuous-Improvement-Step-11.jpg")
    -   Act like you’ve got something to learn from the other person
        even if you’re convinced you’re right. Being stubborn or
        shortsighted is not sophisticated.
    -   If you find yourself getting angry, apologize and take a minute
        to cool off.
7.  Speak about yourself with modesty. Part of being sophisticated means
    giving off an air of quiet confidence without bragging at any cost.
    So, when you discuss whatever you’ve been up to at school or work,
    make sure you don’t talk about how awesome, smart, or brilliant you
    are. If you’ve really done something great, then people will
    recognize it without you needing to show off. If you want to sound
    sophisticated, then you have to practice being modest, not tooting
    your own horn, and earning the respect of others by talking about
    yourself like an average Joe—even if you’re Bill
    Clinton.![](Stop-Letting-Ignorant-People-Bother-You-Step-9.jpg "fig:Stop-Letting-Ignorant-People-Bother-You-Step-9.jpg")
    -   If you ran a marathon, don’t say, “Oh man, it was so easy.” Be
        honest about how challenging it was.
    -   Don’t give people a list of all of the wonderful awards or
        honors you’ve been given. Let them learn about it through other
        means.

### Picking Up Sophisticated Interests

1.  Take up sophisticated hobbies. If you want to be sophisticated, then
    you can’t just look and sound sophisticated—you have to be able to
    do sophisticated things. There are a number of sophisticated hobbies
    and interests that you can take up, and you should pick something—or
    a few things—that really mean something to you, that you enjoy doing
    them, that is. Having sophisticated hobbies will not only make you
    more sophisticated, but it will make you more likely to meet other
    sophisticated people and it will give you something sophisticated to
    talk about. Here are some hobbies of sophisticated
    people:![](Be-Socially-Confident-Step-14-Version-2.jpg "fig:Be-Socially-Confident-Step-14-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Tennis
    -   Badminton
    -   Golf
    -   Collecting records (Especially vintage vinyl, but may include
        classical music or jazz)
    -   Cooking fine cuisine
    -   Collecting fine wines
    -   Travelling
    -   Reading
    -   Watching films (especially classic, foreign, or art films)
    -   Going to museums
    -   Ballroom dancing
    -   Sailing
    -   Gardening
    -   Antiques
    -   Yoga
    -   Martial Arts
    -   Running / Marathons
    -   Rowing/Crew
    -   Horses
    -   Theater - Broadway, opera, ballet, local and dinner theaters,
        Shakespeare
2.  Follow the news. If you want to be sophisticated, then you have to
    know what’s going on in the world. You have to be updated on current
    events so you have a sense of how the world works on a daily basis
    and so that you can contribute to conversations about changes in
    politics, arts, media, or local government. Make sure you watch the
    news for at least 15 minutes a day, or better yet, that you make an
    effort to read the news for at least 15-30 minutes a day, whether
    you do this in the morning, at work, or during your
    commute.![](Improve-Your-Writing-Skills-Step-15-Version-3.jpg "fig:Improve-Your-Writing-Skills-Step-15-Version-3.jpg")
    -   Get your news from as many sources as possible. If you only get
        your news from The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal,
        then you are less likely to get an objective perspective.
    -   If you’re really busy during the week, make an effort to read
        the Saturday or Sunday paper pretty thoroughly so you have a
        sense of what you missed.
3.  [Be well-read.](Be_Well-Read "wikilink") Being well-read is a must
    if you want to be truly sophisticated. Having some knowledge about
    classic works of literature as well as contemporary works will make
    you a more well-rounded, interesting, and sophisticated person.
    Though it’s hard to make room for reading in your busy schedule, try
    to read at least 2-3 books a month, or more, if you can make time
    for it. Here are some ways to be a more well-read
    person:![](Improve-Your-Writing-Skills-Step-11-Version-4.jpg "fig:Improve-Your-Writing-Skills-Step-11-Version-4.jpg")
    -   Stop watching silly TV shows and curl up with a good book
        instead; stop listening to pop music and listen to an audio book
        on the way to work.
    -   Join a book club. This will motivate you to read regularly.
    -   Read the books on the Modern Library’s 100 best novels list.
    -   Read widely. Don’t just read fiction, non-fiction, or books
        written about America. Read books of different genres that
        represent different cultures.
    -   Make a list of books you want to read by the end of the next New
        Year. See how many you can check off your list.
    -   If you want to sound sophisticated, make sure you know that the
        writer George Eliot is a woman, and that the writer Evelyn Waugh
        is a man.
    -   Learn to pronounce the names of French writers. For example,
        Proust is pronounced “Proost,” to rhyme with “roost.”
4.  Love and appreciate other cultures. You don’t have to leave your
    city to learn to appreciate other cultures, though traveling is a
    great way to improve your sophistication. You can appreciate other
    cultures in an almost infinite amount of ways, from watching films,
    eating cuisines from different cultures, and interacting with people
    from different cultures who can teach you a thing or two. Being
    sophisticated means not sounding clueless when a foreign word or
    term comes up, and being in the know instead.
    ![](Improve-Your-Writing-Skills-Step-12-Version-4.jpg "fig:Improve-Your-Writing-Skills-Step-12-Version-4.jpg")
    -   Make it a habit to sample cuisine from different cultures at
        least once a week. Don’t eat the same old thing every day.
    -   Watch a foreign film at least once or twice a month. You’ll be
        surprised by how much you can learn about other cultures. Check
        out great foreign films such as A Separation, The Lives of
        Others, Amour, or any film of Pedro Almodovar to start.
        Contemporary films tend to be a little bit more accessible.
    -   If you have friends who grew up in a different country, make a
        habit of asking them about their backgrounds and the
        particularities of their cultures (without being annoying.)
    -   If you’re still in school and you have the chance to join a
        French club, Latin club, or another club that introduces you to
        a different culture, take it. Don’t be afraid to try something
        new; the Russian Culture Club of Westfield, NJ, had 40 members
        at its very first meeting.
5.  Appreciate the arts. You’ll have to know the difference between a
    Picasso and an El Greco if you want to be sophisticated. You don’t
    have to know every little thing about art, music, literature, opera,
    ballet, film, or every kind of art there is to be truly
    sophisticated, but you should try to have at least a passing
    knowledge of as many of these arts as you can. You can’t do it all,
    but you should try to look like you know what you’re talking about
    when someone mentions Goddard or
    Goya.![](Improve-Your-Writing-Skills-Step-14-Version-3.jpg "fig:Improve-Your-Writing-Skills-Step-14-Version-3.jpg")
    -   Make a habit of doing one cultural thing at least once a week.
        This can mean watching a film, going to a gallery opening,
        ballet, opera, or concert.
6.  Travel as much as you can. Traveling is a great way to broaden your
    horizons, become more open-minded, and to have a firmer
    understanding of how the world operates. If you have the budget for
    it, then try to travel to a foreign country once a year or as often
    as you can; if you don’t have the budget, try traveling to a
    difference state or province whenever it’s possible for you. You can
    learn a lot about the world by seeing how other people live in other
    places.![](Get-Married-in-Italy-Step-8-Version-2.jpg "fig:Get-Married-in-Italy-Step-8-Version-2.jpg")
    -   If you really can’t afford to travel or if you’re too busy to go
        anywhere, try watching the Travel Channel or any shows that
        explore exotic locations when you can. This will still give you
        some insight into how other people live.
    -   Traveling will also help you make more sophisticated
        conversation with other travelers. If someone has come back from
        Paris, you can ask, “How was the Louvre?” and start an
        interesting conversation about it. Reading up about the Louvre,
        and other cultural features of Paris, will help show interest
        and knowledge about France even if you have not gone yet.
7.  Appreciate wine. Drinking wine does not mean chugging a box of
    Franzia in your college’s parking lot before the big football game.
    It means knowing how to appreciate wine from different regions, and
    learning how to recognize different types of wine and the different
    flavors that you can find in a glass of wine. Here are some things
    you will need to master if you want to be
    sophisticated:![](Prevent-Stroke-Step-4-Version-4.jpg "fig:Prevent-Stroke-Step-4-Version-4.jpg")
    -   The different types of wine. Cabernet, Merlot, Pinot Noir, and
        Zinfandel are some common red wines you may encounter;
        Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, and Pinot Grigio are some
        white wines you may drink.
    -   Wine tasting. To taste wine, swirl it around, smell it gently,
        and then take a small, thoughtful sip. Don’t down the whole
        glass without noticing the richness of the flavors.
    -   Pairing wine with foods. White wine tends to go better with
        certain fish, while red wine can bring out the flavors in a rich
        steak.
    -   Dessert wines. If you’re really into wine, you can enjoy a glass
        of sherry or port after your meal. Don’t drink this wine during
        your main meal.
    -   Identifying flavors. Does the wine taste oaked, not oaked,
        earthy, or fruit-forward? Can you detect a hint of chocolate,
        blackberries, or oranges? You’ll have a refined palate with
        practice.
    -   Chilling your wine. White wine should be cold; red wine should
        be kept out of the refrigerator. Don’t put ice cubes in your
        white wine to cool it down unless you want to look
        unsophisticated.
    -   Aerating your wine. Let your red wine breathe for a few minutes
        before you drink it. Better yet, pour it into a decanter or even
        pour it through an aerator into a glass.
8.  Be yourself, with class. Sophistication is about presenting yourself
    well, not pretending you are someone else and doing things you do
    not like to
    do.![](Look-Expensive-Step-9.jpg "fig:Look-Expensive-Step-9.jpg")
    -   Try new sophisticated things, but it is acceptable to be
        uninterested in them. You might not like caviar...that does not
        make you necessarily unsophisticated.
    -   You do not have to smoke or drink to be sophisticated. Plenty of
        very classy people forgo tobacco or alcohol. You do not have to
        be apologetic about that.
    -   It is OK to enjoy mainstream things. You do not have to pretend
        you do not enjoy watching ice hockey, for instance. Or that you
        do not go to Walmart sometimes. Or go to the circus with your
        family.
    -   Sophisticated is not the same as snobbish. Being a well-dressed
        person, who is well-educated, cultured, and poised is a worthy
        goal. Sometimes this is confused with being a snob. A snob looks
        down on people who are not well dressed, or educated, poised,
        and so on. A sophisticated person can be kind, friendly,
        broad-minded, and think well of others.

### Acting Sophisticated

1.  Spend time with sophisticated people. Sophisticated company will
    improve your level of sophistication. You shouldn’t drop all of your
    friends at a moment’s notice just because they aren’t as
    sophisticated as you’d like them to be; you should, however, make a
    goal of hanging out with more cultured, interesting, and open-minded
    people so that you can improve your own level of thinking.
    ![](Work-With-Your-Ex-Step-17.jpg "fig:Work-With-Your-Ex-Step-17.jpg")
    -   You can meet sophisticated people at book clubs, book readings,
        gallery openings and events, poetry readings, concerts, or at
        any art-inspired events.
2.  Don’t lose your cool. Being sophisticated means that you should keep
    your act together in public. This does not necessarily mean you
    never show any emotion, just that you do not fall to pieces in
    public. A sophisticated person gets angry with a witty retort, not
    by shouting obscenities. A sophisticated person may cry at a
    funeral, but not make a scene about
    it.![](Let-Go-of-Anger-Without-Hurting-People-Step-1.jpg "fig:Let-Go-of-Anger-Without-Hurting-People-Step-1.jpg")
    -   If you find yourself getting angry in public, close your eyes
        and take a few deep breaths until you feel yourself returning to
        normal.
3.  Avoid getting visibly intoxicated in public. It’s sophisticated to
    sip a glass of Rosé or white wine on your patio and keep up witty
    conversation—it’s not sophisticated to be seen stumbling around a
    bar, falling into stools and not being able to keep your food down.
    If you want to be sophisticated and have embarrassing drinking
    habits, then it’s time to change your ways. The next time you go
    out, stick to having just one or two drinks, or to drinking until
    you feel slightly buzzed and then
    stopping.![](Self-Detox-from-Alcohol-Step-25.jpg "fig:Self-Detox-from-Alcohol-Step-25.jpg")
    -   If you want people to think you’re sophisticated, although it
        goes deep down within yourself, then people will take you
        seriously, and nobody takes a person who can’t hold his liquor
        very seriously.
4.  Give off a quietly confident vibe. Though being confident isn’t the
    same as being sophisticated, both are qualities of people who look
    like they know what they’re doing. If you’re sophisticated, then
    you’re not immature, unsure of yourself, or generally clueless. You
    can demonstrate your competence by operating with a quiet confidence
    whenever you can. This means staying positive, showing that you love
    who you are and what you do, and not plunging into self-doubt by
    playing out of your
    league.![](Get-a-Guy-to-Notice-You-Step-2-Version-2.jpg "fig:Get-a-Guy-to-Notice-You-Step-2-Version-2.jpg")
    -   There’s a difference between being confident and bragging. You
        can show that you love yourself without talking about how great
        you are.
    -   It’s okay to ask for advice; in fact, admitting that you need
        advice shows character. But if you ask for advice every five
        seconds, then you’ll look like you don’t believe in yourself.
5.  Treat other people with respect. You may think that being
    sophisticated means acting snooty, too cool for school, and blowing
    smoke rings in other people’s faces. However, to be truly
    sophisticated, you have to show that you respect other human beings
    and that you think all people deserve to be treated as your equals,
    even if they aren’t as well-read or refined as you are. Whether
    you’re talking to an old friend, a new acquaintance, or a stranger
    in line at your coffee shop, you should always be polite, kind, and
    helpful when you talk to other
    people.![](Stop-Letting-Ignorant-People-Bother-You-Step-12.jpg "fig:Stop-Letting-Ignorant-People-Bother-You-Step-12.jpg")
    -   If someone doesn’t know a lot about a subject, don’t act like
        you’re such a genius because you do. Instead, take the
        opportunity to share your knowledge (if the person wants to know
        more).
    -   Being polite is a major sign not only of your maturity, but of
        your sophistication. Hold doors for people, don’t cut into
        lines, and say “please” and “thank you” as often as necessary.
    -   Watch your facial and body language because they give away the
        real you that you want to polish. Be on the look out for your
        thought associations, while deep in a conversation, because they
        show others what you're thinking or what your opinions
        are...hold your cards close to the chest.
