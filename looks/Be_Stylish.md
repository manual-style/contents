stylish and appropriate, for whatever life brings, confirms with the
suggestions in this article, then keep reading.

## Steps

### Picking Clothes

1.  [Wear clothes that flatter your
    shape](Dress_for_Your_Body_Type "wikilink"). The first thing to do
    to look effortlessly stylish is to make sure that you’re wearing
    clothes that you feel are good for your body type. Since effortless
    style is supposed to be subtle, you’ll need well fitting clothes in
    order to get the elegant, expensive, stylish look from your
    clothing. You may want garments that make you look thinner and the
    perfect height, with everything in
    proportion.[1]![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Stick to classic cuts. Effortless style is mainly based around
    classic looks. Dressing for current trends just shows that you put
    way too much thought into that outfit and that you’ve been following
    fashion news like a broker watching stocks. Choose classic styles in
    classic cuts for a more effortless look that looks good for
    years.[2]![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   This means women should beware of floor length casual dresses in
        favor of knee-length, for example, while men should shy away
        from skinny-legged suit trousers in favor of something more
        loose-fitting.
3.  Choose muted, neutral colors and bold accents. What colors are
    popular and what colors are considered absolutely hideous is very
    dependent on time and place. Just look at your mom’s clothes from
    the 1970s, for example. In order to look effortlessly stylish,
    you’re going to want a more timeless look, which means sticking to
    more muted and neutral colors. This can, however, be broken up with
    bold accent colors, especially on accessories.
    ![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Muted colors include tan, black, white, denim/navy blue, and
        gray.
    -   Good accent colors include most shades of red, many shades of
        blue, plum/eggplant purple, golden yellow (like rubber ducks or
        tulips), and emerald green.
    -   Be careful of certain colors. Be wary of other greens and
        yellows, and generally avoid oranges, as these colors are very
        prone to going in and out of fashion, but, if you think they are
        stylish, go for it.
4.  Avoid busy prints and textures. Busy prints and textures (like
    fuzzy/fluffy/feathered fabric) can quickly make an outfit look dated
    and unstylish, as these tend to be in fashion only for a season or a
    year at most. Next year it will be another pattern, so why bother?
    Look effortlessly stylish by keeping your clothes in style across
    decades, not
    months.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Buy strategically. To look really stylish, you want your clothes to
    look expensive. You can make cheap clothes look expensive but
    investing in some actually expensive items might be a good idea. A
    few choice pieces of hard-to-fake luxury items, such as a nice
    sweater or wool coat, can really take your wardrobe up a notch.
    Having a limited number of nicer items is preferable to having a
    large number of very cheap-looking
    items.[3]![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Create an interchangeable collection. If you really want to put the
    effortless into effortless style, you’ll want a wardrobe where
    nearly all of the pieces match with each other. This will let you
    get dressed based on comfort, style preference, or weather
    conditions, instead of being limited by color or style
    combinations.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Use a single clothing style (vintage, modern, etc.) and the use
        a single color palette (this should be helped if you followed
        our advice to use muted colors with limited bold accents).
7.  Take care of your clothes. Looking stylish means your clothes are
    going to have to look well maintained. No stains, no holes, no loose
    threads, no wrinkles. If you want your clothes to look maintained,
    then the best way to do that is to maintain them! Keep your clothes
    clean, fold and store them correctly, and do other basic maintenance
    as the needs arise (e.g. sewing minor
    holes).![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Get items tailored. What you probably don’t realize about models and
    famous people is that part of the reason they look so stylish is
    because their clothes fit their body perfectly. And how do you get
    clothes to fit perfectly? Get a tailor of course! Find a reliable
    tailor in your area to alter your clothes perfectly for your body.
    Even some department stores will do this for
    you.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
    -   It’s not as expensive as it sounds. Tailoring a shirt often
        costs as little as $10-20, pants around $30-40.
    -   It may seem like a silly added expense, but tailor a nice
        clothes once and keep them maintained and you’ll look amazing
        for the next ten years. It’s an investment.

### Dressing

1.  Keep it simple. Effortless style is all about looking like you put
    in no effort, so keep your outfits simple. Use a limited number of
    clothing and accessory pieces. This is especially important when it
    comes to
    accessories.[4]![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For example, don’t wear a scarf and bangles and big earrings and
        a hat. Try to limit yourself to two noticeable/accent
        accessories.
2.  Choose an outfit appropriate for the occasion. You’ll want to be
    wearing clothes that look stylish but are not too much for the
    occasion. Over-dressing is a sure sign that you put way too much
    thought and effort into how you’re dressed. Don’t wear a fancy dress
    for grocery shopping, and don’t wear a long gown when a cocktail
    dress will do, for
    example.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Emphasize the accessories. Since your clothes themselves should
    generally be in muted, neutral colors, you’ll want to make your
    accessories your accent pieces. These should draw the attention and
    look extra cool. It is easier to have accessories that conform to
    the latest fashions and trends, so don’t worry about that as much
    (in this area, it’s usually okay).[5]
    ![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For example, you could pair a floppy hat and patterned fashion
        scarf with a brown jacket, blue tee, white skinny jeans, and
        brown boots.
    -   Another example would be to wear a black dress and pair it with
        red earrings and a bracelet.
    -   Just make sure you keep your color palette across the whole
        outfit. Accent accessories colors should generally be the same
        or compliment each other.
4.  Don’t neglect the hair. You’ll want your hair to be stylish too.
    Keep it in a simple style or carefully created “tousled” look, but
    make sure that you are in fact creating the look. Your hair should
    look nice, even if it doesn’t look like you spent an hour getting it
    just
    right.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Avoid products to achieve a more natural look associated with
        effortless style. This means no gel or hairspray!
5.  Use minimal makeup. Women should avoid using very noticeable makeup.
    Keep the colors natural, ladies, and get as close as you can to
    looking like you don’t have makeup on at all. You want to, of
    course, emphasize your best features and hide certain flaws but
    don’t go
    overboard.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Lips are an area of exception, as these can be a great way to
        add a little extra bang to an outfit by introducing bright
        colors, like a classic red.
6.  Keep lines and texture to a minimum. Mixing patterns well is
    incredibly difficult and will make you look more chaotic and less
    elegant. It’s okay to have one item in your outfit have a pattern or
    texture, but keep it limited to
    one.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_14_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_14_Version_2.jpg")
7.  Avoid bulk. Keep layers to a minimum and avoid chunky items or other
    items that add a lot of bulk. These will make you appear chubbier
    and less streamlined and stylish. Oversized sweaters have a time and
    place, but tend to go in and out of fashion to a certain extent, so
    be
    careful.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_15_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_15_Version_2.jpg")

### Presenting Yourself

1.  Don’t neglect scent. While it may not be visually apparent, scent
    can go a long way towards developing how people perceive you. Smell
    nice by keeping yourself and your clothes clean, but also consider
    adding a perfume or cologne to your fashion line-up. Avoid young
    scents like fruity smells in favor of something more mature for a
    really classy
    touch.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_16_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_16_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Have a signature style. Keep your clothes in a theme in order give
    yourself a signature style. This is a look that people will
    associate with you and will make you seem more stylish, even if they
    don’t necessarily like your
    clothes.[6]![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_17_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_17_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Fit your look to you. The style you create for yourself should
    generally match who you are as a person. For example, a really sweet
    woman taking on a catty look will seem weird and out of place, the
    same as a serious businessman dressing in gangsta style. Tailor your
    clothes to fit your personality and people will be much more
    inclined to see it as your
    style.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_18_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_18_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Be confident. Do you ever feel like some models could wear a brown
    paper sack and still walk down a runway looking like the height of
    fashion? Do you know a guy who wears a tracksuit and still somehow
    manages to look totally fashionable? What the fashion industry
    doesn’t want you to know is that a lot of looking stylish really
    comes down to projecting confidence. You don’t have to actually be
    confident, of course, but if you walk down the street in clothes
    that you clearly think you look great in, people will usually be
    inclined to agree that (at a minimum) those clothes are perfect for
    you.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_19_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_19_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Act like you don’t care - or, actually don't care. The effortless
    part of the stylish look should of course be presented by giving off
    an air that you don’t care, or that you just threw on the first
    outfit you could find. Be humble or indifferent when people
    compliment your
    clothes.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_20_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_20_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Walk gracefully. In order to look stylish, you’re also going to want
    to look elegant and coordinated. This means not falling down if
    you’re wearing heels. Being graceful should be easier for guys, but
    is still important so don’t neglect
    it.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_21_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_21_Version_2.jpg")
7.  Look comfortable, even when you’re not. Even if you’re wearing 4”
    stilettos, you need to look like it’s all perfectly natural and
    you’re perfectly comfortable. Don’t complain and constantly readjust
    your clothes. If that style isn’t working out for you, if you can’t
    seem casual in it, then try something that’s actually more
    comfortable. You can be comfortable and stylish.
    ![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_22_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_22_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Relax. Again, effortless style is all about looking awesome while
    also looking like you didn’t try at all. Effortless, right? So
    relax. Take a generally chill attitude to everything in life. Always
    stay calm and happy, and you’ll look much better, no matter what
    you’re
    wearing.![](Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_23_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Effortlessly_Stylish_Step_23_Version_2.jpg")

## Tips

-   Read the fashion section of a variety of magazines, such as
    Cosmopolitan and Glamour for the gals, and GQ for the guys. Collect
    tips; pay attention to what you like and dislike.
-   Never let the clothes wear *you.* Your personality is what should
    shine through, not the personality of your clothes!
-   Make with what you have; mix and match old clothes, or redesign and
    old pair of jeans
-   When you feel you need to update your wardrobe a little, look
    through your closet and try to find a way to wear something you
    already have differently instead of immediately going shopping.
-   Remember, following trends does not always make you stylish. True
    style depends on picking and choosing - You should wear what you
    think flatters you and suits your personality.
-   When you use necklaces and/or accessories, use them in colors that
    are in or go with your outfit!
-   You don't have to have clothes from all the newest or hottest
    designers. Look for the more simple pieces from lower end stores,
    like simple t-shirts and blouses, and then dress them up with the
    sometimes pricier accessories and/or jackets.
-   Checking out thrift stores is a must. Especially in wealthy areas,
    thrift stores can be really handy.
-   Don't just go to Hollister and Abercrombie, because everyone else
    does. they are not the most original, and therefore do not always
    look stylish.
-   Run to the bargain bin! You'll be surprised at what you'll find.
    Just because they're cheaper, does not necessarily mean they're not
    stylish. Also check out consignment stores and garage sales. You can
    find many cute, unique things for a fraction of their original
    price.
-   Sometimes you can find a great deal at a thrift shop or a
    consignment shop. Don't think that expensive clothes are the way to
    go if you want to be stylish.
-   If you don't feel comfortable wearing something, don't. Don't think
    you have to fit in and wear something that everyone else is,
    especially if you don't like how it feels on you or what message it
    sends. Dress so you feel comfortable and confident.
-   Don't be frightened to wear knee length skirts or tops that have a
    higher neckline, men find women that cover up a bit more mysterious.
-   Some girls may not want to show their bare legs. This is fine as you
    can go for skin colour tights to give the illusion that your legs
    are bare. Try to get them as close to your natural skin tone as
    possible.

## Warnings

-   Don't choose clothes just because other people like them. Have your
    own style, live the way you want to.
-   Don't be trashy, if you would rather die than let your parents see
    what you're wearing, then don't wear it!
-   Don't go out too exposed, wear some clothes! Going out in a low cut
    tube top and booty shorts is not stylish.
