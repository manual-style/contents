Whether it’s for school, work, or a family function, many people prefer
the comfort of casual clothes over more formal wear. The good news is
you don’t have to sacrifice style for comfort! With a little creativity
and the right eye for materials and colors, you can easily make yourself
look sharp with casual wear, even if you can’t afford those high-end $99
jeans!

## Steps

### Looking Sharp in Casual Wear

1.  Know which casual items can double as “stylish.” Remember: some
    casual clothes, like cargo shorts, always come across as just
    that--casual--no matter what other fancy items you might wear with
    them. Learn which items are safe to choose from. Clothes that are
    safe to pick from
    include:[1]![](Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   *Men*: blazers; button-down shirts; t-shirts; nice jeans;
        chinos; tailored shorts; casual sneakers; boat shoes; loafers,
        brogues; boots; dress shoes.
    -   *Women*: wrap dresses; summer dresses; nice jeans; linen pants;
        tank tops; fitted tops; sneakers; flats; boots; low heels;
        sandals.[2]
2.  Develop a discerning eye. Aim to strike the perfect balance between
    casual and stylish. Imagine two extremes: a fancy ‘60’s cocktail
    party and a rough-and-tumble day at the beach. When picking items to
    wear, imagine wearing them to both occasions. Aim for an outfit that
    would look slightly too relaxed and casual to fit in with the cast
    of *Mad Men*, but too nice to risk scuffing up
    outdoors.![](Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   When in doubt, err on the side of fitting in more with the
        cocktail party folks than the beach bums.[3]
3.  Choose the right material. Avoid clothes made from fabrics that
    wrinkle easily, like cotton, rayon, and silk. Remember: you want to
    look casual but stylish, so you still want to look sharp. So unless
    you’re able to change outfits throughout the day, stick to fabrics
    like:[4]![](Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Cashmere
    -   Denim[5]
    -   Knit
    -   Leather
    -   Lyocell
    -   Polyester
    -   Wool
4.  Wear more than one layer. Rest assured: you don’t need a whole
    collection of individually stunning garments to impress people
    visually. Instead, create a more interesting look by simply layering
    the clothes you do have. Make them work as a team for a
    “sum-is-greater-than-its-parts” effect. For instance, you can
    layer:[6]![](Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   A vest or sweater over dress shirts.
    -   A blazer or light jacket over a t-shirt.[7]
    -   Tasteful bras and bralettes under any tops or dresses that offer
        a glimpse underneath.[8]
    -   Stockings, tights, or leggings under skirts and dresses.
5.  Use contrast to make your outfit pop. Catch people’s attention by
    avoiding a totally uniform appearance. Vary your look by adding one
    or two touches that will either stand out from the rest or juxtapose
    other elements. For
    example:[9]![](Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If, say, you dress all in black, wear a pair of white shoes (or
        a belt, or a tie, or all three).
    -   Pair a skinny pair of pants with a loose-fitting top.[10]
    -   Wear a tighter top or jacket with a billowy skirt or dress.[11]
    -   Pair dark bottoms with light tops, and/or dark tops with light
        bottoms.[12]

### Matching Colors

1.  Fill your closet with neutrals. Make things easy for yourself when
    you’re trying to pair one piece of clothing with another. Buy lots
    of clothing in neutral colors so just about everything you own will
    match each
    other.[13]![](Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Perfectly neutral colors include white, black, and gray.[14]
    -   More earthy tones include camel, cream, brown, gold, navy blue,
        olive, and silver.
2.  Use accents. If you have a favorite color that you want to be known
    for, buy several articles in different shades. Or, if you’re less
    picky, buy a variety of bolder colors. Then perk your otherwise
    neutral outfits up with one of these articles, like wearing a bold
    red shirt with navy blue jeans and a black leather jacket.[15] In
    addition to clothes, you can also accent your outfits with
    accessories
    like:[16]![](Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Ties
    -   Belts
    -   Jewelry
    -   Suspenders
    -   Purses and bags
3.  Be sure to match colors that aren’t neutral. If you find neutrals
    too boring, go ahead and dress in something bolder. Just make sure
    one element of your outfit doesn’t clash with another. Be aware that
    even though you personally like two different colors, people are
    hardwired to look for harmony in colors.[17] When you assemble an
    outfit, start with one article as your base color and pair other
    items that match.

### Shopping on a Budget

1.  Stick to simple garments. If you need to make your clothes last,
    check out their construction before you buy them. Keep in mind that
    any extra little add-on (like unnecessary buttons, sequins, or
    silkscreens) is just one more thing that might fall off or fall
    apart. Don’t get stuck with, say, a t-shirt that looked stylish on
    the rack but now looks like a hand-me-down because the silkscreen
    flaked off! Put it back on the rack and pick out a simpler item
    instead.[18]![](Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
    -   ”Simple” doesn’t have to mean “plain.” Remember: a pair of
        black-and-white striped pants isn’t constructed any differently
        than a pair of solid black pants! If you want a little more jazz
        in your clothes, look for items made with different prints and
        materials.
2.  Avoid clothes that need to be dry-cleaned. If budget is an issue,
    check the care label for each item while shopping. Only buy clothes
    that say, “Machine Wash.” If the care label tells you that the item
    needs to be dry-cleaned, put it back. Bear in mind that dry-cleaning
    is often pricey, so get the most wear out of your purchases by
    sticking to items that you can afford to wash
    regularly.[19]![](Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_10.jpg "fig:Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Give your machine-wash clothes a longer life by only using cold
        water to wash them. Then dry them in a machine with low heat, or
        simply let them air-dry.
3.  Don’t rely on belts. There are exceptions to every rule, but beware:
    a cheap belt often looks cheap. Don’t spoil your casual-chic look by
    holding up those stunning pants with a dinky-looking belt! Only buy
    pants that stay up just fine on their own, even if you already have
    a good, quality belt at home (just in case it gets lost or
    ruined).[20]![](Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_11.jpg "fig:Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_11.jpg")
    -   If you do need a belt for pants, don’t worry about it. You’re
        aiming for stylish but casual, so keeping your shirt untucked is
        a perfect way to hide it.[21]
    -   If you like to wear loose dresses and draw attention to your
        waist at the same time, wear a more form-fitting top or jacket
        instead of a belt.
4.  Forget high heels. Obviously, high heels are pretty chic, but if you
    are going for a more casual look, look for something else. Get more
    for your money with a pair of shoes that is perfectly stylish and a
    bit more versatile. Instead of high heels, shop for an eye-catching
    pair of flats, low heels, or
    sneakers.[22]![](Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_Stylish_While_Being_Casual_Step_12.jpg")
