Ever notice how some famous people seem to become beloved icons while
others seem to fade into nothingness? As an example, rappers J-Kwon and
Jay-Z both had major hits on the Billboard Top 100 in 2004, but only one
of them is still putting out successful albums and scoring prestigious
guest spots today.[1] There's no sure-fire way to predict what sorts of
looks and attitudes will be popular in the future, but with a few
common-sense strategies, it's not hard to give yourself the right
ingredients for lasting popularity — the rest is a mixture of hard work
and luck!

## Steps

### Looking Timeless

1.  Choose clothing with "classic" appeal. If you're interested in
    looking timeless, start by considering clothing choices that have
    *already* been proven as timeless. While many trends in fashion come
    and go, some basic outfits stay more or less the same over time.
    Below are just a few outfit ideas for men and women that have been
    popular for at least a quarter-century and likely will be for the
    near
    future:![](Be_Timeless_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Timeless_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   **Women:** Skirts with blouses, jeans with tee shirts, black
        tights, simply-patterned dresses, flats, heels.
    -   **Men:** Shirt-and-tie combos, suit jackets/blazers, fitted
        dress pants, medium-to-dark jeans, polo shirts, medium-length
        tee shirts, sneakers, dress shoes.
2.  Prioritize simple, minimalist outfits over complicated ones. Having
    a timeless look is often as much about what you *don't* wear as it
    is about what you *do* wear. A timeless look is one that doesn't
    "try too hard" to catch others' attention. Instead, it lets the
    wearer's natural good looks speak for themselves. Try to wear mostly
    simple, unpretentious pieces of clothing, rather than flashy,
    overly-showy pieces. Whites, blacks, one-color items, and simple
    prints are good ideas — neon colors and overcomplicated patterns are
    not.![](Be_Timeless_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Timeless_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Not only will this give you a timeless look, but it will also
        save you money in the long run as you shop for clothes. Simple
        pieces of clothing (especially items that are either white or
        black) can be used in a huge range of outfits and still look
        good, while flashy pieces usually give you much more limited
        options and require you to buy more clothing to compensate.
    -   For a great example of timeless fashion from the world of TV,
        consider the cult classic 90s show *Twin Peaks.* In show that's
        filled with sometimes-garish late 80s/early 90s fashion choices,
        the show's main character, detective Dale Cooper, looks about as
        good today as he did back then. By wearing mostly simple,
        elegant suit-and-tie combinations, he avoids looking like a
        stereotypical member of Generation X and instead achieves
        timeless appeal.
3.  Wear clothing that fits you naturally. Almost every outfit will look
    best on you if your clothing fits well. While it may occasionally be
    fashionable to wear clothes that don't fit properly in a
    conventional sense, these sorts of fashion choices are unlikely to
    beat the long-term appeal of clothing that fits you well. If you're
    shopping for formal clothes, don't be afraid to spend a little extra
    money at a tailor's to get your outfits looking just right. For
    casual clothes, you can be a little more forgiving about getting
    your fit exactly right, but it's still in your best interest to pick
    clothes that fit your figure comfortably without being too
    loose.![](Be_Timeless_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Timeless_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   As a very general rule, clothing that's especially tight or
        especially loose is often part of a temporary trend or fad. For
        example, think of the tight pants worn by men in the disco scene
        in the 1970s — they were popular at one point, but today, it
        would be almost unthinkable for a man to seriously wear
        skin-hugging white polyester slacks. Keep this in mind if, for
        example, you're considering shopping for skinny jeans to give
        yourself a modern hipster look!
4.  Don't go overboard with accessories. One or two great accessories
    can be the "cherries on top" of a timeless outfit — on the other
    hand, wearing a dozen flashy accessories can be a great way to date
    yourself. Below are just a few great accessory ideas for men and
    women — try to pick one or two at maximum and tend towards simple,
    elegant accessories rather than large, attention-seeking
    ones.![](Be_Timeless_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Timeless_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   **Women:** Jewelry/earrings, purse/backpack, sunglasses, light
        makeup/lipstick, bracelets, painted nails, scarves
    -   **Men:** Dignified watches, ties, simple cufflinks,
        backpack/messenger bag/briefcase, sunglasses, jewelry or
        medallion (preferably worn around the neck and under the
        clothes)
    -   For a textbook example of how to use accessories, look up photos
        of Audrey Hepburn in her prime. The most famous photo of the
        actress shows her in-character for the movie *Breakfast at
        Tiffany's* with plenty of jewelry and a long, skinny cigarette
        holder that would look fairly out-of-fashion today. However, the
        photos of Hepburn out-of-character are another story — she
        usually wears simple, one-colored tops accompanied with elegant
        earrings and light makeup for a look that's as striking today as
        it was decades ago.
5.  Keep a natural, clean-cut hairstyle. Some hairstyles belong to a
    certain time and place, while others virtually never go out of
    style. For example, it's difficult to think of a "beehive" hairdo
    without thinking of out-of-date style that housewives wore in the
    1960s. On the other hand, a woman who wears an ordinary bob or
    simply lets her hair grow out won't necessarily scream, "2010s!" in
    a few years. Below are just a few ideas for hairstyles that aren't
    likely to go out of style any time
    soon:![](Be_Timeless_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Timeless_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
    -   **Women:** Bobs, "fringe" cuts, long natural hair, layered cuts,
        ordinary ponytails, braids, bangs (optionally)
    -   **Men:** Crew cuts, buzz cuts, short parted hairdos, shaved
        heads. Light application of gel or pomade is OK.
    -   As a very general rule, hairstyles that require lots of
        maintenance or upkeep are less likely to be timeless than
        others. For example, a spiky liberty mohawk, which requires
        daily application of hair products to keep it standing up, will
        almost always call to mind the punk scene of the 70s and 80s.
        There are, however, some exceptions — dreadlocks, for instance,
        can require some work to maintain, but can be a perfectly
        timeless look for someone with naturally kinky hair.
6.  Be conservative with tattoos and piercings. When it comes to being
    timeless, modifying your body permanently is something you'll want
    to be very careful about. You can always throw out or donate
    tasteless clothes, but piercings and (especially) tattoos can be
    much harder (and more expensive) to get rid of. Never get a tattoo
    or piercing on a whim — instead, talk to your friends, your family,
    and your tattoo artist/piercer to discuss whether it would be a
    smart long-term choice. When in doubt, err on the side of safety and
    don't get the tattoo or piercing. It's never embarrassing *not* to
    have any tattoos or
    piercings.![](Be_Timeless_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Timeless_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Keep in mind that, unfortunately, potential employers may make
        judgements about you based on your tattoos or piercings. It's
        not fair, but it's true — many employers report that tattoos
        (especially those on the hands or face) can make an
        otherwise-qualified applicant seem unsavory.[2]
    -   Women have a little more freedom with piercings than men do. For
        example, it's not at all unusual for a woman to have earrings,
        but it's still sometimes considered unconventional for men to
        wear them, especially in formal settings. Many women can even
        pull off wearing a simple nose stud in a formal context, while
        this would be very unusual for a man to do.
    -   As a general rule, if you're getting a tattoo, it's wisest to
        get it somewhere on your body that isn't ordinarily exposed
        (like your chest, ribs, back, and so on.) This way, even if your
        tattoo ends up being a source of embarrassment in a few years,
        you won't have to show it to anyone you meet.
7.  Beware of styles that became popular only recently. If there's one
    major rule to take away from this section, it's this: avoid fashion
    trends that are popular today but weren't popular in the past,
    because these are almost certain to become unpopular again sooner or
    later. Fashion trends are constantly changing — a piece of clothing
    or a haircut that's "in" today may be majorly embarrassing in just a
    few years' time. However, by sticking to the classic, timeless
    suggestions above (which have changed only a little over the last
    few decades) you'll stay looking great for years to
    come.![](Be_Timeless_Step_7_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Timeless_Step_7_Version_3.jpg")

### Acting Timeless

1.  Don't be afraid of aging. Having a timeless sense of style is as
    simple as buying some new clothes and getting a good haircut.
    Becoming a timeless person, however, is another thing entirely —
    you'll need to attempt the difficult tasks of unfocusing your
    attention from the here and now and getting a broader perspective on
    life. To start, try to place less of an importance on the passage of
    time in the first place. Don't worry about growing old — trying to
    stay young forever or recapture past glory days will only date you.
    There are few things more awkward than someone who's aged out of a
    certain social group trying desperately to stay "cool" in the eyes
    of the younger
    members.![](Be_Timeless_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Timeless_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you're worried about growing up or aging, it can help to look
        at the benefits of these things, rather than just the scary and
        sad parts.[3] For instance, while adults may sometimes fall out
        of touch with old friends, they also have lots of opportunities
        to make new ones while devoting their energy to a fulfilling
        career. Older people also usually have the advantage of maturity
        and experience over younger people, which can make things that
        used to seem like a big deal (for instance, peer pressure) seem
        like no big deal at all.
2.  Be true to yourself, not passing trends. A timeless person has a
    self-identity that doesn't change depending on what's currently
    popular. Don't make any conscious choices to redefine yourself based
    on what other people think. Instead, any change in the way you see
    yourself should come about naturally and effortlessly over time.
    Don't look down on yourself if you don't conform exactly to what's
    popular today. Popularity is fleeting and can change at a moment's
    notice — the sense of peace you get from being true to yourself, on
    the other hand, lasts
    forever.![](Be_Timeless_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Timeless_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Beware: living your life to be trendy at all costs without
        considering your true feelings can cause significant problems in
        the long run: for instance, you may waste time and money trying
        to get a hold of the latest clothes and consumer goods, you may
        lose sight of who you truly "are" as a person and suffer
        identity confusion, and more. Being true to yourself avoids all
        this.
3.  Don't compare yourself to other people. In the words of Teddy
    Roosevelt, "Comparison is the thief of joy."[4] It's a common piece
    of life advice to avoid comparing yourself to other people because
    it's ultimately pointless and will almost always lower your
    self-image. This habit isn't just a surefire way to become insecure
    and unhappy, however — it will also keep you from being timeless.
    Spending your time worrying about how everyone has a better life
    than you robs you of the time and energy you need to grow as person.
    Rather than changing and maturing naturally, you become static,
    forcing yourself only to make changes as a reaction to other people
    and never because of your true feelings and
    desires.![](Be_Timeless_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Timeless_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For young people, avoiding harmful comparisons to other people
        can be as simple as resisting peer pressure: for example, you
        shouldn't abandon your tried and true friends once you get a
        chance at hanging out with the "cool kids." Why be stressed
        about appearing unpopular when you can simply enjoy your time
        spent with your true friends?
    -   For adults, this can be more complex: for example, you won't
        want to compare yourself unfavorably to a coworker who has all
        the latest tech gadgets or a new car. These things are sources
        of fleeting pleasure, not lasting satisfaction, so they have no
        bearing on your status as an individual. If you're true to
        yourself and this person is not, you're the happier person, no
        matter what car you drive.
4.  Have an appreciation for great things from the past. Someone who's
    living a timeless life won't be obsessed only with media and art
    that's currently popular. Instead, she'll have a rich variety of
    interests that shows an appreciation for the great works of the past
    and a discriminating taste for the best that the modern world has to
    offer. A timeless person understands, for instance, that while the
    language of great books, movies, and music may eventually start to
    seem old-fashioned, the thoughtfulness and emotional resonance of
    these works don't diminish with time. Below are just *a few* select
    examples of pieces of media that are widely considered to be
    timeless (there are many, many
    more.)![](Be_Timeless_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Timeless_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
    -   **Books:**[5] *Ulysses*, *To Kill a Mockingbird*, *Lolita*,
        *Catch-22*, *Native Son*, *I, Claudius*, *Pride and Prejudice*,
        *A Brave New World*.
    -   **Movies:**[6] *The Godfather*, *Citizen Kane*, *Vertigo*, *The
        Shawshank Redemption*, *Casablanca*, *Apocalypse Now*, *Alien*.
    -   **Music:** *Revolver* (The Beatles), *Dark Side of the Moon*
        (Pink Floyd), *Aquemini* (Outkast), *What's Going On* (Marvin
        Gaye), *Blood on the Tracks* (Bob Dylan), *Thriller* (Michael
        Jackson), *London Calling* (The Clash).
5.  Pick timeless role models. A timeless person knows that's wise to
    pick inspiring people to look up to and to learn from their example
    when possible. The people who inspire us can be famous people who've
    achieved great things, people who have shown incredible strength and
    integrity, or simply friends and family members who have given our
    lives meaning in some way. Don't waste time worshiping at the altar
    of pop celebrities — instead, pick a genuine role model with
    something more substantial and long-lasting to offer you. Below are
    just a few examples of role models who are truly
    timeless![](Be_Timeless_Step_12_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Timeless_Step_12_Version_3.jpg")
    -   **Jesse Owens:** A black American who won four gold medals at
        the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, Germany, single-handedly
        humiliating Adolph Hitler and disproving the Nazi doctrine of
        Aryan racial superiority.
    -   **Florence Nightingale:** A british nurse who selflessly treated
        wounded soldiers during the Crimean war whose contributions to
        the field of nursing helped improved the terrible conditions of
        hospitals at the time.
    -   **Sri Chinmoy:** Indian spiritual leader who founded the
        Oneness-Home Peace Run, an event in support of world peace.[7]
    -   Note also that role models don't necessarily have to be real
        people — fictional characters can also be sources of inspiration
        in your life. A well-written character like, for example,
        Atticus Finch from *To Kill a Mockingbird* can be a great role
        model. In this example, Finch's tremendous strength of character
        and sense of justice can be an inspiration to anyone who wants
        to create these qualities in herself.

## Tips

-   Take good care of your skin and body, both men and women. Looking
    youthful for longer gives you a more timeless quality. Lots of
    laughter helps this sense of youthfulness at any age.
-   If you're a woman, avoid overdoing makeup, always. The natural look
    will always be more timeless than any fad makeup look.
