Visual Kei is not just a fashion or music genre, but a form of art, and
a lifestyle! If you are a die-hard Japanese Rock fan that wants to
really get into this scene, then this guide can help you!

## Steps

### Preparing Yourself

1.  Understand that music is what Visual Kei is all about! Before diving
    into it, you should first expose yourself to this type of music. You
    should be familiar with Japanese rock bands and/or Visual Kei bands.
    ![](Be_Visual_Kei_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Visual_Kei_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   There's plenty of information on Visual Kei available on the
        Internet; you can download the music (but don't forget to buy it
        occasionally to support the artists you love), join online
        forums on the subject, and much more. There are also some
        sources that you can learn from, such as Japanese Rock
        magazines. (Shoxx, Cure, Purple Sky, etc.) Many of these
        magazines have excellent information on every aspect of Visual
        Kei and feature countless bands that may end up sparking your
        interest.
    -   Don't be afraid to interact with other Visual Kei fans! Their
        love for the art is deep; it's okay to know a lot about band
        members and be 'dorky' talking to other Visual Kei fans about
        them. They will only match your excitement, and you may even be
        inspired to pick up an instrument yourself!

#\*To get even more into Visual Kei it is always fun to not just listen
to the music, but watch videos as well. Not only music videos but
backstage clips, special commercials, videos for the fan club, etc. (The
last is usually something only Visual Kei bands do, possibly for more
exposure. But all the same; they can be entertaining in themselves and
can help you understand how and where other Visual Kei fans pick up some
mannerisms that may seem a bit odd to outsiders).

1.  Become Visual. After becoming part of the Visual Kei fan base, you
    will probably be interested in looking more like your favorite
    artists. You should start out by doing just that; reflecting the
    looks of bands. Once you get used to the way that looks and feels on
    you, then you should start to create your own, unique style. Do
    plenty of research into the different types of Visual Kei, as there
    are a lot of them. It is a style that blankets a whole range of
    different looks, so pick the one you prefer most before adopting.
    -   Note: It's best, as with all larger changes in appearance and
        behavior, not to switch into a Visual Kei style overnight. If
        you have no transitional period into your desired outcome, then
        you will tend to look like a poser. Start subtly: put on a
        little more eye makeup than usual, then build it up to more
        eyeliner, then more shadow, and finally to the full Visual Kei
        makeup. If you're already in a particular style, drop it slowly.
2.  Find things in your wardrobe that could already be linked to the
    Visual Kei style and begin wearing them before you begin to buy more
    flamboyant clothes. Do not change your hairstyle immediately,
    either: hair is arguably the most important part of the Visual Kei
    look (along with clothing) so give it a while before you pick
    something radical.
3.  Start telling your friends about visual Kei music or talking more
    about the style. (Be sure not to overdo it.) If people know you are
    going through a style change beforehand, then they will not be as
    surprised as if they had no warning.
    -   Alternatively, change style after a long holiday. The time gap
        will make the switch more plausible.
4.  Once you have changed your look noticeably, do not immediately wear
    all the brightest neons, biggest dresses or most vinyl bondage gear
    that you own. Again, start subtly before you go
    over-the-top.![](Be_Visual_Kei_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Visual_Kei_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")

### Makeup

Here are a few steps to applying your Visual Kei makeup. There is no
particular look you have to conform to; with Visual Kei makeup is
freedom to experiment. (Believe me, there are some pretty wild-looking
bands out there.) Makeup is allowed 'anywhere' in Visual Kei. You can
put it on anywhere on your face, and anywhere on your body for that
matter. Never put yourself down or get discouraged! Just remember that
practice makes perfect, and keep working at it!

1.  Hygiene comes first. Before starting anything you should be clean.
    Be sure your hair is soft and groomed, not oily or frizzy. Use a
    gentle scrub to clear away any dead skin and oil on your body, and
    pat yourself dry. You may want to use just a little bit of
    moisturizer to keep your skin from looking too dry, and this can
    also make applying makeup a bit easier. After you are all ready,
    clip back your hair to keep it out of your
    face.![](Be_Visual_Kei_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Visual_Kei_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Use foundation. Usually, Visual Kei makeup creates a very pale look.
    However, not many bands nowadays go for the full-facial white
    face-paint look, but there is nothing wrong with doing that, either.
    For a completely white face, do not over-apply! This can cause the
    makeup to look cakey. Use a makeup sponge or brush to spread it
    evenly over your face for a clean finish. If you want even more of a
    'ghostly' glow on your face, you can apply a small amount of powder.
    If you cannot find any powder foundations that are light enough,
    baby powder can work wonders. For a more common look, you should
    choose a liquid foundation one or two shades lighter than your
    actual skin tone, but not any lighter than thatâ€“it will end up
    looking unnatural. You might want to choose a foundation with little
    or no oil because it can be uncomfortable and tends to look heavy.
    Water-based foundations are much lighter and sometimes cheaper. You
    may be able to spread out your foundation with your fingers.
    However, to avoid any streaking, you may be better off with a makeup
    sponge. After evenly applying your liquid foundation, make sure
    there are no obvious streaks or lines, and apply a small amount of
    powder foundation or shimmer. If you wish to manipulate lighting or
    the shape of your face, you should have even lighter and darker
    foundations handy. To accentuate features, use darker foundation on
    places such as cheekbones, on your jawline and around your nose. To
    give a bit more of a light, elegant look you can use lighter
    foundation on the bridge of your nose, your brow area, and/or
    cheeks.![](Be_Visual_Kei_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Visual_Kei_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Wear eye makeup! This is probably the most important part of the
    process, so be sure to make your eye makeup interesting and unique,
    but still
    tasteful.![](Be_Visual_Kei_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Visual_Kei_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Eyeshadow. Different colors and shades of eyeshadow can be applied
    in whatever order you want. Depending on how eccentric you want to
    look, it is always best to have a wide range of colors at hand. If
    you only plan on using one color, you might want to have different
    shades of that single color. First apply the base color onto the
    eyelid, usually towards your eyelashes, or nearly to the brow for a
    bold look. Next, take a darker shade and apply it to only the top of
    your lid, blending it with the lighter color. To enhance your eyes
    further, you could use a small amount of shadow on the bottom lid
    and blend. Applying eyeshadow is not a very time-consuming task, so
    you should experiment with what looks best on you.
5.  Eyeliner. This is the 'key' to making your eyes look amazing! There
    are many different looks to choose from. You could look natural and
    elegant, bold, eerie, or anything else you can imagine. First, apply
    black or colored eyeliner (pencil or liquid) to the inner-most part
    of your eye and close to the lashline of your top eyelid to avoid
    any odd streaks of color, then apply thicker, to your liking. People
    with single eyelids or 'Asian' eyes should probably cover most of
    their eyelid to get the same desired 'thick' look. A popular style
    is the 'panda' look, where the eyeliner is raised thicker and
    farther beyond the eye. It is very common in Visual Kei for eyeliner
    to go past the corner of your eye for a certain look. This look
    could make your eyes seem thinner, more seductive, menacing, or
    cuter depending on how you apply it. For a darker look, eyeliner can
    be applied to the bottom lid but be careful not to over-do it. To
    make your eyes stand out more you can apply eyeliner to the outer
    corner of your eye, it growing thinner as you go along the bottom
    lid. Sometimes using white or lighter colored eyeliner on your
    bottom lid can give a nice touch and/or contrast. Do not forget to
    be creative! Feel free to create designs, or use contrasting colors
    for a more drastic look.
6.  Heavy, intricate eye makeup is a bit difficult to do every morning
    if you are in a hurry- so if you want to be quick about it, why not
    try experimenting with a more everyday look? Something as simple as
    surrounding your eye with black eyeshadow for a smoky look and
    wearing concealer and gloss on your lips can look great for
    daily-wear.
7.  Add jewels and other items. Jewels are always a nice and fun touch
    to finish off your eyes. You can place them along the bottom of your
    eyelid, in a row down the side, across your nose to the other eye,
    or anything you can think of! You can get jewels at any craft store
    or anywhere where cosmetics are sold. They may come with glue or you
    may need to use your own. An old glue stick could be fine, and
    eyelash glue works perfectly! Remember, in Visual Kei the sky's the
    limit. Look as strange as you please. Other items can be used, such
    as buttons, glitter, bits of fabric, fishnet/mesh - even tinfoil! If
    you like how it looks, go for it. Another wonderful touch for your
    eyes is false eyelashes. Be as tame or as wild as you want. Usually,
    the crazier-looking lashes are easiest to find during Halloween. If
    you want to add some extra pop to your eye makeup, why not even try
    circle lenses in a variety of
    colors?![](Be_Visual_Kei_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Visual_Kei_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Lips. Usually, a nice gloss will finish off your look, but you can
    go much further if you'd prefer. Some bands will smear makeup,
    usually black, from their lips to the side of their face. While this
    is easy and can look great, it must be remembered that this is often
    ridiculed by older members of the scene due to its connections with
    cosplay and amateurish outfits. Others will make their lips pale
    (usually with foundation) and only color the inner portion of the
    mouth for a creepy, rigid look. For a full effect, you could always
    use lipliner, though it can be tricky to apply, so keep at it if
    you're going to use it. Just be creative with your lips: Line them
    with black and color them in with white, only color half of your
    lips, color beyond your actual lips, or anything you want. Have
    fun!![](Be_Visual_Kei_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Visual_Kei_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")

## Tips

-   Visual Kei is a *genderless* style! It is suited for both males and
    females, so just have fun with it no matter what others may think.
-   Not all J-rock bands are dark! The style ranges right from
    deconstructed, gothic-like Nagoya-Kei aesthetics through to
    rainbow-bright, peppy Oshare-Kei (or "pop-Kei") looks and everything
    in between. Have fun and make it as shocking or cutesy as you like!
-   The Japanese Rock magazine 'CURE' has great step-by-step makeup
    tutorials.
-   Using white eyeshadow right under your eyebrow can make it look
    smoother, and bring out more color in your eye. It really is
    helpful!

## Warnings

-   You may be ridiculed, or mistaken for 'emo', 'goth', 'scene', or
    flat-out gay. Do not be discouraged by this! Simply correct them if
    you are offended. Remember, they are only ignorant of your style.
-   You cannot only look the part, you have to **be** the part. If you
    just dress in Visual Kei but know next to nothing about the music,
    people will know you are faking it. It's just annoying.
-   Be prepared for other fans to strike up conversations about the
    fashion or music. If you are a Visual Kei noob, this can be
    intimidating but do not be ashamed. Just try to keep educating
    yourself, and you will soon fit right in.
