So, you want to change your style or reputation? Want to be wholesome
and innocent? It's not easy to, but it's worth it.

## Steps

1.  Get the attitude. Be [modest](Be_More_Modest "wikilink") and
    [ladylike](Be_a_Lady "wikilink"). To look virtuous and sweet, don't
    yell or scream. [Don't curse](Stop_Swearing "wikilink") or be
    disrespectful. Just be kind to others and [be
    nice](Be_Nice "wikilink"). Courtesy and confidence is
    key.![](Apologize-For-Cheating-on-Your-Partner-Step-7-Version-2.jpg "fig:Apologize-For-Cheating-on-Your-Partner-Step-7-Version-2.jpg")
2.  Stop swearing. It may be hard to cut out, but swearing is one of the
    worst things you could do if you're trying to be ladylike. Try
    making a deal with your friends about not swearing for a day. Just
    think about proving to everyone you have the will power and self
    control to actually control and think about what comes out of your
    mouth. If you're a person who swears loads, this is not a ladylike
    thing. Definitely say things like "shoot" and "idiot". Try not to
    use crude words like "crap" or "retarded". They're not okay. Try to
    make very calm and civil comebacks, not the regular old stuff. It'll
    take practice, but it's a huge step towards being
    innocent.![](Be-Mature-Step-15-Version-2.jpg "fig:Be-Mature-Step-15-Version-2.jpg")
3.  Wear the clothes. Wear pastel clothes, like white, pink, grey,
    orange and brown. This will enhance your look of vulnerability and
    will make you look
    innocent.![](Be-Stylish-While-Being-Casual-Step-1.jpg "fig:Be-Stylish-While-Being-Casual-Step-1.jpg")
4.  Note that a conservative or preppy look is best for this time of
    your life, when you are at your most vulnerable. Make sure hemlines
    reach at least your fingertips and necklines reach the collarbone
    area. Invest your hard-earned money in a few quality clothing and
    jewelry pieces that you will need your whole
    life.![](Dress-Up-Jeans-Step-7.jpg "fig:Dress-Up-Jeans-Step-7.jpg")
5.  Wear stuff that is clean, doesn't reveal too much, fits and suits
    you, and isn't too harsh. Sounds complicated, but it's not. You
    could also try wearing a really light and clean top over a long
    sleeved white top. If the top you're wearing over it is very pretty
    and gives off the "baby doll" theme, you'll get the perfect,
    ladylike look. Experiment and play
    around.![](Be-Sexy-in-Middle-School-(for-Girls)-Step-4-Version-2.jpg "fig:Be-Sexy-in-Middle-School-(for-Girls)-Step-4-Version-2.jpg")
6.  Shower every day. Make sure you use a conditioner and a shampoo
    that's right for your hair type (i.e. if you have thin hair, don't
    use a shampoo designed for thick
    hair).![](Get-Rid-of-Chest-Acne-Step-1.jpg "fig:Get-Rid-of-Chest-Acne-Step-1.jpg")
7.  Make sure your hair is nice. Don't leave too much hair on your face
    unless you have bangs. Don't feel like you have to pin your bangs
    off your face and do an old fashioned style -you don't. Just make
    sure your hair looks sleek and well looked after. Wash your hair a
    couple of times a week, and use a good and sweet smelling
    shampoo.![](Keep-Your-Hair-Straight-with-a-Perm-As-a-Black-Girl-Step-5-Version-2.jpg "fig:Keep-Your-Hair-Straight-with-a-Perm-As-a-Black-Girl-Step-5-Version-2.jpg")
8.  Don't comb or brush your hair too much, and don't use too many hair
    products. They damage your hair. Try not to curl or straighten too
    much, don't use it too much unless it's a special occasion. Your
    hair can be any length, it doesn't have to be very
    long.![](Grow-Thick-Curly-Hair-Step-2-Version-2.jpg "fig:Grow-Thick-Curly-Hair-Step-2-Version-2.jpg")
9.  Keep in mind that medium length is quite nice, and a bob is cute and
    neat. As for hairstyles, you can do anything. Side ponytails,
    braids, buns, anything. Just make sure the style won't come out
    during P.E or anything, and that you won't have to keep adjusting
    it. Add a white, pink, or gold ribbon for a nice effect, and
    matching hair clips. The headbands with little bows on the side are
    very sweet and lady
    like..![](Style-Shoulder-Length-Hair-Step-3-Version-2.jpg "fig:Style-Shoulder-Length-Hair-Step-3-Version-2.jpg")
10. Maintain your nails. Clear coat on your fingernails; color or french
    pedicure on your toes. Don't let the skin around them get dry to the
    point that they crack, and stop biting your nails. If you polish
    them, go for a natural French manicure, clear polish, or even
    neutral, solid-colored polish. Don't let the polish chip off, and
    don't let your nails get too
    long.![](Make-Matte-Nail-Polish-Step-39-Version-5.jpg "fig:Make-Matte-Nail-Polish-Step-39-Version-5.jpg")#Do
    not be involved in immoral and promiscuous activity, such as sexual
    activities, drinking and smoking. This will give you a bad
    reputation, and will harm you eventually.
11. Participate in quiet activities. Try quiet and leisurely activities,
    such as [reading](Love_Reading "wikilink"), writing, listening to
    the radio and talking on the phone(not to much or it will annoy your
    parents).![](Make-Yourself-Feel-Better-(When-You're-Sick)-Step-14-Version-2.jpg "fig:Make-Yourself-Feel-Better-(When-You're-Sick)-Step-14-Version-2.jpg")
12. Keep a low profile. When you are at parties or at social events, you
    can flirt, but not too much. Just say hi and chat about nice things,
    like concerts, movies and television
    shows.![](Flirt-With-Your-Boyfriend-Step-2-Version-2.jpg "fig:Flirt-With-Your-Boyfriend-Step-2-Version-2.jpg")
13. Act like you're innocent. Develop this kind of
    attitude.![](Create-Conversation-With-a-Boring-Boyfriend-Step-5.jpg "fig:Create-Conversation-With-a-Boring-Boyfriend-Step-5.jpg")
14. Always be nice and generous. Having a selfish and nasty attitude
    towards others will drag you very far away from being sweet or lady
    like. Always have a smile on your face, and be willing to let people
    borrow things from you (but not to the point that they're using
    you).![](Feel-Good-About-Yourself-Step-20-Version-2.jpg "fig:Feel-Good-About-Yourself-Step-20-Version-2.jpg")
15. Be nice to everyone, even people who you think are losers, because
    nobody is a loser and everyone is a human being. Everyone deserves a
    chance, so make sure you give it to them. Don't exclude people from
    games, gifts, or secrets, keep your promises and don't gossip. When
    someone gossips about someone else, politely tell them you find
    gossiping rather mean and would prefer not to. Don't be mean or
    hotheaded, always keep your
    cool.![](Deal-With-Snobby-People-Step-4.jpg "fig:Deal-With-Snobby-People-Step-4.jpg")
16. Be graceful. This is a difficult step, but also a crucial one. Being
    graceful doesn't mean you have to hate sports and walk on tiptoe.
    Just make sure you walk with your head up, shoulders rolled back and
    your back straight. Don't swagger, or swing your hips. It looks
    exaggerated and weird. Don't swing your arms either - keep them by
    your
    side.![](Approach-Women-Anywhere-Step-25-Version-2.jpg "fig:Approach-Women-Anywhere-Step-25-Version-2.jpg")
17. As for sports, just make sure you drink plenty of water to keep off
    red faces and sweat, and try your hardest. Don't drag your team
    down,
    participate.![](Cleanse-the-Lymph-System-Step-6-Version-3.jpg "fig:Cleanse-the-Lymph-System-Step-6-Version-3.jpg")
18. Do not insult, gossip, or slander. When necessary, voice your
    opinions appropriately and constructively. This encourages your
    audience to listen carefully when you speak. But if someone is
    bulling you you have the right to
    insult.![](Defeat-Your-Enemies-Step-9.jpg "fig:Defeat-Your-Enemies-Step-9.jpg")
19. Compliment everyone, but not too much. You don't want to come off as
    creepy. Compliment people you wouldn't normally talk to, it's a good
    way to make new
    friends.![](Be-a-Better-Girlfriend-Step-14.jpg "fig:Be-a-Better-Girlfriend-Step-14.jpg")
20. At home, try your best to please your parents. i.e. Go to bed on
    time, offer to wash the dishes, bring in the groceries, clean up
    after dinner, etc. No matter how tempting it is, if you know there's
    something you should be doing (no matter how badly you don't want to
    do it), do it! They will trust you and let you do more
    things.![](Distract-Yourself-from-Hunger-Step-8-Version-2.jpg "fig:Distract-Yourself-from-Hunger-Step-8-Version-2.jpg")
21. Make sure your belongings are neat. Make sure you label and cover
    all of your school and text books. Try just covering them with clear
    contact paper,it looks a lot neater. If you really like patterned
    contact paper, try the metallic looking ones that come in red,
    silver, blue and gold. Label your things and look after them to make
    sure they don't get lost or damaged. Buy some nice pencils and pens,
    fancy pen or a cute- colored pencil. Make sure you always have
    enough of everything, constantly asking to borrow things isn't very
    lady like or innocent. When buying a school bag, go for light and
    neutral colors and posh brands, stuff that's good
    quality.![](Focus-on-Studies-Step-3-Version-2.jpg "fig:Focus-on-Studies-Step-3-Version-2.jpg")
22. Concentrate in School. It's important to be looked on as intelligent
    and keen at school. Try hard in every single, solitary subject and
    class you take, and always hand in homework(on time!). Don't talk
    during class(you have loads of time for that later, don't pass notes
    either-it gets very embarrassing if you're caught). Ask questions
    and participate in class discussions. Try to get involved with the
    school and its' activities, too. Reading up on background
    information about a topic you're studying is good too, and can
    actually be interesting. Help others if they're struggling, and
    don't suck up to your teachers. Just try hard, be punctual in
    everything and share your
    knowledge.![](Learn-a-Language-Step-3-Version-2.jpg "fig:Learn-a-Language-Step-3-Version-2.jpg")
23. At school try to get a seat where you can clearly hear and see the
    teacher and chalkboard and pay attention. A good goal to set for
    yourself is to try to get mostly A's in everything you do at school,
    including homework. Take notes, study for tests, focus, but most of
    all, come to school ready to learn and try not to worry about the
    social scene too much, after all, that's not what school is for. try
    to join extra curricular activities but only if you know it will not
    bring your grades
    down.![](Study-Late-at-Night-Step-5.jpg "fig:Study-Late-at-Night-Step-5.jpg")

## Tips

-   **Get a really fun hobby**. Ballet is just fabulous for this; it's
    the peak of sweet and innocent.
-   Follow and cherish *any* rules that you are supposed to follow at
    school, home, or *wherever* else you go.
-   **Be on good terms with everyone**. You never know when you'll need
    it.
-   To get that wholesomeness down track, be quiet on occasion and only
    speak when spoken to. That will give you an aura of mysteriousness
    and purity.
-   **Don't do anything to get you in trouble**. Try not to break too
    many serious rules, and always think about the consequences of your
    actions before you actually carry them out. You never know-it might
    just save you an un-wholesome detention.
-   Know what has been assigned for homework and don't procrastinate.
-   Have a stuffed animal, unicorn, or Hello Kitty. That's cute.
-   Try getting cute, yet organized pieces, like a special school bag
    called a Randoseru.
-   **Always be really nice to your family**, no matter how much they
    annoy you. It really is important.
-   This is not an article you should ease into, just go for it.
-   Don't wear dark colors. That will give you a look of rebelling and
    evilness, and you don't want that if you want to be pure.

## Warnings

-   Your friends might think your acting weird and if they ask you
    what's going on, just say that you're trying to improve yourself.
    Don't lie.
-   Some people may dislike you or call you stuck-up or nerdy. If you
    know you've done nothing wrong or nasty, simply ignore them. They're
    trying to bring you down, so don't let them.
-   You may find it good to do this over a summer, or long break.
    Especially if you were the complete opposite of what this is.
