any way you want. Read the steps below, if you want.

## Steps

1.  Look through [catalogues](Be_a_Catalog_Model "wikilink"). This helps
    you get ideas of what is in fashion and what styles you want to try.
    You don't have to look a current clothing catalogue, you can look at
    the date ones if you don't wish to be current, but do want some
    inspiration.
2.  Read fashion magazines. [Vogue](Become_a_Teenvogue_Model "wikilink")
    is always a good choice. Don't look just at the clothes - look at
    how the model's are styled, their hair, and the makeup they wear.
3.  Choose a [fashion icon](Be_a_Fashion_Icon "wikilink"). Pick a
    classic fashion icon like Coco Chanel, Marilyn Monroe, Bridgette
    Bardo, or Twiggy. Choose someone contemporary like Beyonc√©, Taylor
    Swift, Madeline Stewart, or Miley Cyrus. Think outside the box or go
    mainstream, and pick a fashion icon who's style best fits yours.
4.  [Have a fashion show](Have_a_Fashion_Show_at_Home "wikilink"). Being
    a Maxinista means picking out your style, and showing it off. Show
    off fashion to yourself, your family, or your friends. Take pictures
    and share them on social media. Put together outfits, try your
    latest TK Maxx treasure with old favourites, experiment with colour
    combinations, and different textures of fabric. A good choice to
    start of with, possibly, would be to try some soft pastel coloured
    items with some 'harder' items - they can always go with a leather
    jacket.
    -   Look through your closet and [choose stylish
        outfits](Choose_an_Outfit_That_Suits_You "wikilink") of what you
        like to wear every day. Have your outfits make a statement about
        you and what you love.
5.  Invest if a statement coat that you can wear with a lot of other
    outfits. Have a bag that you adore and can carry to any occasions.
    Don't be scared to economize on the basics. If you want to wear a
    plain white T-shirt, for example, you can get this from a value
    store or spend a fortune in a [designer
    store](Find_Designer_Clothing_on_a_Budget "wikilink").
6.  Find the [style of makeup](Apply_Makeup "wikilink") that you see as
    the most fitting for you, and the occasions you attend. Don't
    forget, makeup is rarely compulsory. You can wear none if you like.
    Immigrate the styles of others, or find something unique.
7.  Choose your [hairstyle](Choose_a_Hairstyle "wikilink") in one that
    you normally like. There are myriad options you can try. If you like
    to change you hair a lot, make sure you take care of it too to keep
    it [beautiful and healthy](Get_Beautiful_Hair "wikilink").
