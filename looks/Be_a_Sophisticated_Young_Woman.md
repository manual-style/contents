If you’ve ever met a woman who seems effortlessly sophisticated and
classy, you may find yourself wondering how she does it. Fortunately,
becoming a sophisticated young woman isn’t as difficult as it may seem.
You can increase your sophistication by working on your social graces
and taking time to learn and experience new things. To create a
sophisticated look, build a wardrobe of timeless and elegant pieces.

## Steps

### Developing Good Social Graces

1.  Speak [politely](Be-Polite "wikilink") to others. Be thoughtful
    during everyday conversations and choose words that show respect and
    consideration. Using simple, polite phrases like “please” and “thank
    you” may not seem like a huge deal. However, these basic social
    graces are a big part of being classy and
    sophisticated.[1]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For example, when you meet someone for the first time, don’t
        just say “Hi.” Shake their hand and say something like, “It’s a
        pleasure to meet you.”
2.  Be kind and [considerate](Be-Considerate "wikilink") in your
    actions. Look for simple ways to be kind and helpful in your
    day-to-day interactions with other people. This can include simple
    actions like giving someone a sincere compliment, holding open a
    door, or offering to help tidy up after a
    meal.[2]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Part of being considerate is being punctual and reliable. If
        you’re ever unable to meet an obligation or be somewhere on
        time, let the other person know and apologize to them right
        away.
    -   Although it can be frustrating if you feel like your kindness is
        not appreciated, practice being kind for its own sake. Don’t
        expect or demand anything in return.
3.  Develop strong listening skills. Taking time to [actively
    listen](Actively_Listen "wikilink") to others is not only gracious
    and considerate, but will also help you be a better communicator.
    When someone else is speaking, give them your full attention. Make
    eye contact and let them finish what they have to say before you
    respond.[3]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Try asking questions or rephrasing what the other person said to
        make sure you understand them.
    -   You can show that you are listening by nodding or using verbal
        cues, such as “Right,” “Mm-hm,” or “I understand.”
4.  Avoid excessive slang and cursing. There’s nothing wrong with
    cursing or using slang and informal language when you’re goofing
    around with your friends. But when you’re trying make your image
    more sophisticated, keep your speech clear and
    clean.[4]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   For example, if someone asks you if you’re going to an event,
        don’t say, “Oh yeah, I’ll totes be there, it’s gonna be
        awesome!” Instead, try something like, “Yes, I’ll be there. I’m
        looking forward to it!”
5.  Try to [keep your cool if you have an
    argument](Stay-Calm-in-an-Argument "wikilink"). It’s natural to get
    upset and have disagreements with others from time to time. If you
    get into a confrontation, keep it classy by being the bigger person.
    Do your best to stay calm and avoid lashing out or putting the other
    person
    down.[5]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you’re struggling to stay calm, excuse yourself and go take a
        few deep breaths before you continue the conversation.
    -   Use “I” language to let the other person know how their actions
        affect you without attacking or blaming them. For example, say
        something like, “When you show up late to our study sessions, I
        don’t feel like my time is being respected.”
6.  Practice good etiquette in social situations. Whether you’re at the
    dinner table or attending a school dance, do your best to use
    appropriate manners for the setting. If you’re not familiar with the
    situation, take time to study proper etiquette
    beforehand.[6]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For example, if you’ve been invited to a formal dinner, find out
        about the dress code before you go.
    -   Brush up on modern etiquette for a variety of situations with a
        book like *Classy: Exceptional Advice for the Extremely Modern
        Lady* by Derek Blasberg.

### Becoming More Cultured

1.  Read books on lots of subjects. Reading is a great way to learn new
    things, expand your horizons, and become more sophisticated. It will
    also give you an edge in social situations, since you’ll always be
    able to talk about what you’ve been reading! Make it a goal to read
    books in a variety of genres, including fiction, non-fiction, and
    classic
    literature.[7]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Don’t just stick to literary classics or books you think you
        “should” be reading. Read about whatever you find interesting!
2.  Take time to [learn something new every
    day](Learn-Something-New-Every-Day "wikilink"). Building your
    knowledge and skills will help you become a more cultured and
    sophisticated person.[8] Try reading an article about an unfamiliar
    subject each day, taking a few minutes to get caught up on current
    events, or working on a new
    skill.![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
    -   You can also try signing up for classes on subjects you find
        interesting. If you’re not in school, look for classes you can
        take online, at a community center, or at a local college or
        university.
    -   Try taking up a new hobby, like painting, crocheting, archery,
        or rock climbing.
3.  Get to know people from different backgrounds. Step outside of your
    own familiar setting by spending time with people from different
    cultures and social backgrounds. Try getting to know people of
    different ages, too. You may be surprised by what you can learn from
    them!![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_9.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Traveling is a great way to get to know people from other
        cultures, but it’s not always practical or affordable. If you
        can’t travel, try connecting with a pen pal from another
        country.
4.  Try new foods. A big part of becoming cultured is getting out of
    your comfort zone and experiencing new things. Try new foods from
    different cultures to expand your horizons and develop a more
    sophisticated
    palate.[9]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_10.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Visit a restaurant that serves a kind of food you’ve never
        tried, or invite a friend from another cultural background to
        swap recipes with you.
    -   Eating new foods is a great way to learn about other cultures
        and connect with other people who share your interest in good
        cuisine!
5.  Learn to [appreciate the arts](Appreciate-Art "wikilink"). Make time
    to learn about some artists or styles you’re unfamiliar with, or
    learn more about art you already know and admire. Cultivating an
    interest in the arts, whether visual or performance-based, will help
    make you a more well-rounded and sophisticated
    person.[10]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_11.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_11.jpg")
    -   Try visiting a museum or art gallery, going to the theater, or
        attending a dance performance.
    -   Taking a class about art history or criticism can help you
        understand and appreciate the arts on a deeper level.

### Creating a Sophisticated Look

1.  Wear neat, [well-fitting clothes](Buy-Clothes-That-Fit "wikilink").
    To look sophisticated and put-together, dress in clothes that are
    clean, wrinkle-free, and flattering. If you’re not sure how to pick
    clothes that fit you properly, go to a tailor or a lingerie store
    for advice and a professional
    measurement.[11]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_12.jpg")
    -   You don’t need expensive designer clothes to look sophisticated.
        Wearing clothes that look tidy and fit you well is more
        important!
    -   Structured pieces, like a fitted blazer or an A-line skirt, can
        give you a classic, elegant look.
2.  Dress appropriately for every occasion. Whether you’re attending a
    school dance, going on a job interview, or having dinner with family
    friends, choosing the right attire can make a big difference in the
    impression you make. Choose clothes that are modest and not too
    dressy or casual for the
    occasion.[12]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_13.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_13.jpg")
    -   For example, if you’re going to a formal wedding, a silk dress
        (knee-length or longer) or pantsuit would be a good choice. Just
        avoid wearing anything white or overly flashy so you don’t
        upstage the bride!
    -   For a job interview, a suit is a good bet, but you can also look
        sophisticated and put-together with a blouse, pencil skirt, and
        fitted jacket.
3.  Keep your style simple and timeless. Stick to a simple, minimalist
    style to help keep your wardrobe from becoming quickly outdated.
    Choose a few basic, high-quality clothing pieces in neutral colors.
    To liven up your look, pair your neutral wardrobe staples with some
    bold
    accessories.[13]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_14.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_14.jpg")
    -   For example, you might [pair a classic little black
        dress](Accessorize-the-Little-Black-Dress "wikilink") with a
        colorful, chunky statement necklace.
    -   Simple pieces in solid colors are great for mixing and matching
        to create a variety of different outfits.
4.  Choose a flattering and elegant hairstyle. Put a little effort into
    styling your hair each day. This will give you a tidy and
    well-groomed appearance. Your hair is likely to be one of the first
    things that other people notice about your appearance, so choose a
    style that reflects your cool, sophisticated side. For
    example:[14]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_15.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_15.jpg")
    -   Go for a short haircut if you want to look more confident and
        professional.
    -   A sleek updo is a great way to create an elegant look,
        especially for a special occasion.
    -   Your hair color can also affect how others perceive you. For
        instance, studies show that many people see brunettes as more
        serious and mysterious than blondes or redheads.
5.  Put on some subtle makeup if you like. While wearing makeup isn’t a
    must, it can help you look more stylish and sophisticated. To create
    a simple, classic effect, put on some
    [mascara](Apply-Mascara "wikilink"),
    [blush](Apply-Blush "wikilink"), and a bold
    [lipstick](Apply-Lipstick "wikilink").[15]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_16.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_16.jpg")
    -   If you’re going for a radiant, glowing look, stick to
        highlighters and eyeshadows with a subtle shimmer rather than
        obvious glitter.
6.  Practice good personal hygiene. Keeping yourself clean, tidy, and
    nice-smelling will definitely help you maintain your sophisticated
    image. Shower daily and establish good
    [skin](Take-Care-of-Your-Skin "wikilink") and [hair
    care](Take-Care-of-Your-Hair "wikilink") routines to keep yourself
    looking your best. Remember to [care for your
    nails](Care-for-Your-Nails "wikilink"),
    too.![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_17.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_17.jpg")
    -   Having well-manicured nails can make a big difference to your
        overall appearance. Keep your nails relatively short or medium
        in length, and stick to clear or nude polish for a classy and
        mature look.[16]
7.  Adopt [proper posture](Improve-Your-Posture "wikilink"). To make
    yourself look more confident and poised, stand tall, keep your head
    up, and push your shoulders back. In addition to helping you appear
    more sophisticated, having good posture will also prevent wear and
    tear on your body as you get
    older.[17]![](Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_18.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sophisticated_Young_Woman_Step_18.jpg")
    -   If you spend a lot of time in front of computers or other
        devices with screens, keep them at eye level to prevent
        hunching.
    -   [Doing yoga](Do_Yoga "wikilink") can improve your posture,
        strengthen your joints and muscles, and help you become more
        attuned to what your body is doing.
