The "starkidd" style is known from icons such as Videokidd, Dizzi,
Squeak and has a twist of scene and
[harajuku](Dress_Harajuku_Style "wikilink").

## Steps

1.  Start listening to electro music and remixes of pop music. Good
    bands to like would be Dragonette, Toybox, Freezepop and Kidd
    Kishore. Try to search for those artists
    online.![](Be_a_Starkidd_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Starkidd_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Of course, get yourself a social media accounts. Premade layouts are
    no go's! Try to learn basic CSS or use a generator. Don't be afraid
    of using tons of colors. Well, when your layout is done, add text.
    Use quotes, small cute pixel pictures, and add pictures of yourself
    who isn't in your picture albums. Put a lot of text in different
    fonts, colors and types. Don't be afraid of LOTS of pictures,
    painting, graffiti tags
    etc.![](Be_a_Starkidd_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Starkidd_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Get some crazy hair. Get different colored dreads, use falls, clip
    on/off bang or anything like that. A good idea would to have your
    hair bleached blonde all the time, so you can color areas with neon
    Manic Panic (or other brand) hair dye. Add lots of weird hair
    accessories to your
    hair.![](Be_a_Starkidd_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Starkidd_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Spell like your 10 years old. In words like you or yours, try to
    spell them yoo/yoors. But don't copy other people, make up your own
    way to spell
    things.![](Be_a_Starkidd_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Starkidd_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Be very
    cheerful.![](Be_a_Starkidd_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Starkidd_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Get some DIY. Jewellery like Sugar and Spice or other brands, and
    clothing from Johnny wishes etc. Well, look around Myspace or at
    www.johnnywishes.com/featured.html . Then, "model" a bit for the
    brands. Take pictures with your
    purchases.![](Be_a_Starkidd_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Starkidd_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
7.  Become "famous". Add people, make "deals" like; If I'm in your top
    friend, your in mine
    etc.![](Be_a_Starkidd_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Starkidd_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Study [harajuku girls](Dress_Harajuku_Style "wikilink") and adapt
    their
    trends.![](Be_a_Starkidd_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Starkidd_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
9.  Get a lot of friends. Scene kids and [emos](Be_Emo "wikilink") are
    acceptable. But don't only go with them. See if you can find all
    sorts of friends. Scene boyfriends are the
    best.![](Be_a_Starkidd_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Starkidd_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
10. Get yourself a cute nickname. Example: RocketDaisy, StarTrash,
    Videokidd, LITEBRITE, CandyBitch etc. Don't copy other people. Don't
    use your real name, if you can get out of it. Kelsey Glamour etc. is
    supposed to be a scene kid thing, so don't go
    there!![](Be_a_Starkidd_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Starkidd_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
11. Keep your real name PRETTY hidden. Don't show it off to much. It can
    be on your large and long Myspace profile, but don't scream it
    out.![](Be_a_Starkidd_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Starkidd_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
