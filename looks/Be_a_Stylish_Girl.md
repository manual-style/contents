[Being stylish](Be_Stylish "wikilink") doesn’t necessarily mean
following all the latest fashion trends.[1] In fact, most stylish people
do the opposite: they wear classic, timeless pieces and do things to
spice them up, such as adding accessories or rolling up the sleeves of a
tailored shirt. Being stylish isn’t so much about what you wear as how
you wear it. Confidence is key!

## Steps

### Exploring Fashion

1.  Discover your fashion icons. A great way to develop your own
    personal style is to explore the style of others. This will help you
    figure out your tastes—what you love, what you dislike, and what
    you’d like to
    try.![](Accessorize-Step-9-Version-2.jpg "fig:Accessorize-Step-9-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Fashion bloggers, celebrities, and designers are great people to
        look to when exploring fashion.
    -   Keep track of your fashion icons' looks and interests on social
        media sites, such as Instagram and Pinterest
2.  Create a fashion scrapbook. This can be online via sites like
    Pinterest or Clothia, or using a physical scrapbook, into which you
    could paste print-outs and magazine cut-outs. Consider organizing
    your pages in some way. For
    example:![](Have-Fun-Alone-Step-8-Version-3.jpg "fig:Have-Fun-Alone-Step-8-Version-3.jpg")
    -   By what you'd wear during each season, such as spring, summer,
        and winter.
    -   By different garment type, such as jackets, boots, and dresses.
    -   By purpose and occasion, such as work, formal, and casual.
3.  [Consider who you are](Create_a_Signature_Look "wikilink"). As you
    explore fashion, consider whether a theme emerges when you look at
    your favorite items. Are you often choosing punky looking outfits?
    Maybe you’re more into a retro style like ‘70s rockstar or ‘50s
    pin-up, or maybe you’re more of a
    minimalist.![](Wear-Combat-Boots-Step-6.jpg "fig:Wear-Combat-Boots-Step-6.jpg")
    -   Think about what the things you like say about you, and about
        how you can express who you are through the things you wear.
    -   If you’re an outgoing actor who loves to dress up, you might
        wear bright colors and chunky accessories, for example.
4.  Don’t be a carbon copy. As you start out it might feel overwhelming
    to put together a great outfit, and it may be tempting to just copy
    other people’s outfits. Try to keep your look more unique by doing
    variations on what you see
    elsewhere.![](Accessorize-Step-3-Version-2.jpg "fig:Accessorize-Step-3-Version-2.jpg")
    -   For example, you might do the same silhouette as someone else
        did, but with different colours or patterns.
    -   Alternatively, you can use the same colors, but different
        pieces. For example, instead of wearing a white blouse, a blue
        skirt, and tan heels, try a white shirt, blue jeans, and tan
        boots.
    -   Add individuality to your outfit by using different accessories,
        such as bags, belts, hats, or jewelry. For example, instead of
        using fancy gold jewelry, you could try rustic wood jewelry.
5.  Pay attention to how people wear things. Ever seen those “who wore
    it better” photos? People rarely wear the same clothes in the same
    way. In addition, they’ll often pair their clothes with different
    hairstyles and accessories. For
    example:[2]![](Get-Noticed-by-Popular-Kids-Step-13.jpg "fig:Get-Noticed-by-Popular-Kids-Step-13.jpg")
    -   One person might wear a loose-fitting blouse untucked over
        skinny jeans with a pair of thigh-high boots.
    -   Another person might wear the same blouse tucked into the same
        skinny jeans, but with the sleeves rolled up and a pair of
        chunky ankle boots.
6.  Don’t be a snob. Stylish people can put together great outfits no
    matter what store they’re in. Don’t limit yourself to the big brand
    stores. Check out thrift, vintage, and discount shops to see if you
    can find any
    treasures.[3]![](Accessorize-Step-10-Version-2.jpg "fig:Accessorize-Step-10-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Consider the corporate ethics of the stores that you shop in,
        especially if you're trying to be politically and
        environmentally conscious.
    -   For example you could shop exclusively at stores that use
        naturally-sourced materials and donate their proceeds to
        different organizations.
7.  Stay true to yourself. It’s important to step outside of your
    comfort zone and try new things, but don’t do so at the expense of
    your self-confidence. Only wear what makes you feel like the best
    version of
    yourself.![](Be-a-Ride-or-Die-Chick-Step-1-Version-2.jpg "fig:Be-a-Ride-or-Die-Chick-Step-1-Version-2.jpg")
    -   For example, if you don't feel comfortable dressing "sexy" in
        tight jeans and low-cut tops, then you don't have to.
    -   Set a style for yourself. If you like vintage-inspired clothing,
        then go for it! Part of being stylish is being unique!
8.  [Be confident](Be_Confident "wikilink"). Confidence is as important
    to style as what you’re wearing.[4] Ever heard the saying “don’t let
    the clothes wear you”? If you lack confidence, you might not be able
    to pull off the stylish clothes that you
    love.![](Get-Noticed-by-Popular-Kids-Step-5.jpg "fig:Get-Noticed-by-Popular-Kids-Step-5.jpg")
    -   Work on [feeling good about yourself](Love_Yourself "wikilink")
        no matter how you look, and no matter what hangups you may have
        about your body.

### Building a Stylish Wardrobe

1.  Choose a few classic staples to build your wardrobe around. Style
    experts build their closets around a few key pieces—all in neutral
    colors—that can be combined to make the majority of their
    outfits.[5] Nearly all of them list the same basic
    pieces:[6]![](Get-Noticed-by-Popular-Kids-Step-1.jpg "fig:Get-Noticed-by-Popular-Kids-Step-1.jpg")
    -   **Tops:** white, long-sleeved, button-down dress shirts,
        neutral-colored crew-neck sweaters, and neutral-colored V-neck
        T-shirts.
    -   **Bottoms:** slim-legged black slacks, dark blue skinny jeans,
        and neutral-colored pencil skirts.
    -   **Dresses:** little black dress in whatever shape best fits your
        body type.
    -   **Shoes:** basic black pumps, black or brown ankle boots, and
        nude or black ballet flats.
    -   **Outerwear:** black blazers, beige or black trench coats, and
        black or neutral-colored motorcycle jackets.
2.  Have a signature silhouette. Narrow your style down to a set of
    silhouettes that suit your body. This will help focus your choices
    and make it easier to buy new clothes and put together
    outfits.[7]![](Dress-Like-Coco-Chanel-Step-12.jpg "fig:Dress-Like-Coco-Chanel-Step-12.jpg")
    -   Once you know what you look best in, stick to that silhouette
        and buy variations on it.
    -   Your silhouette might be tight pants with chunky boots and
        loose-fitting tops, or high-waisted skirts and dainty heels.
3.  Consider your daily routine. When buying clothes, shoes, and
    accessories keep in mind how you spend your days. This will ensure
    that you actually wear what you
    buy.[8]![](Enjoy-High-School-Step-2.jpg "fig:Enjoy-High-School-Step-2.jpg")
    -   For example, teacher will need a completely different wardrobe
        (e.g., slacks, pencil skirts, sweaters and flats) than a
        waitress at a fancy restaurant (e.g., cocktail dresses and
        heels).
4.  Clean out your wardrobe. Remove everything that doesn’t match your
    current style tastes. If something doesn’t fit you properly, donate
    it or have it tailored.[9] Make sure that you feel great in
    everything that’s in your
    closet.![](Be-a-Vegan-Teenager-Step-4.jpg "fig:Be-a-Vegan-Teenager-Step-4.jpg")
    -   Be picky. Get rid of anything that you don’t feel good in. It's
        just taking up space and making it more difficult to compose
        stylish outfits.
5.  Spice up your outfits with accessories. Belts, handbags, and
    statement necklaces are a great way to spice up your classic
    clothing
    pieces.[10]![](Dress-Like-Coco-Chanel-Step-5.jpg "fig:Dress-Like-Coco-Chanel-Step-5.jpg")
    -   Take a little black dress from day to night by switching your
        flats for heels, and adding a big statement necklace.
6.  Don’t forget about hats, belts, and bags. Earrings and necklaces
    aren’t the only things you can use to boost your
    style.![](Accessorize-Step-1-Version-2.jpg "fig:Accessorize-Step-1-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Cinch in your waist and add a retro look to a plain little black
        dress by combining it with a vintage brown belt and handbag.
    -   Wide-brimmed hats have enjoyed popularity for a while now.
        They’re a great way to dress up most outfits, and are often seen
        paired with maxi dresses or skinny jeans and blazers.
7.  Invest in a pair of sunglasses. Another must-have accessory for the
    stylishly minded is sunglasses. Generally big aviators and cat’s eye
    sunglasses have been popular over the past few years, but you need
    to choose what looks best on your
    face.[11]![](Be_Fashionable_at_a_Pool_Party_Step_9.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_at_a_Pool_Party_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Stand at a sunglasses rack and try on all the different styles.
        Who knows? Maybe you look best in a pair of small circular
        sunnies like John Lennon wore.

### Trying Specific Tricks

1.  Keep it neutral. If you’re worried about what colors to go with,
    start with a neutral palette like black, grey, beige, and white, and
    then incorporate a few punchy items as you
    go.![](Dress-Like-Coco-Chanel-Step-11.jpg "fig:Dress-Like-Coco-Chanel-Step-11.jpg")
    -   For example, pair a vibrant green blouse with a black pencil
        skirt and black blazer.
    -   Alternatively, complement a little black dress with a chunky,
        colorful statement necklace.
2.  Experiment with monochromatic outfits. Monochromatic outfits, or
    outfits all in one color, can be really eye-catching. Try putting
    together an outfit in all one color—popular choices are red or
    white, but really it depends on what looks best with your skin and
    hair.[12]![](Dress-Like-Coco-Chanel-Step-3.jpg "fig:Dress-Like-Coco-Chanel-Step-3.jpg")
    -   All black is a safe bet (although maybe a bit too safe!) and can
        go easily from casual to chic.[13]
3.  Always wear accessories. Classic fashion advice is to go
    minimalistic on the clothing and silhouettes and then amp them up
    with accessories.[14] Adding an unexpected accessory that doesn’t
    obviously go with your outfit can give it an extra punch. For
    example:![](Dress-Like-Coco-Chanel-Step-7.jpg "fig:Dress-Like-Coco-Chanel-Step-7.jpg")
    -   Pair a feminine cardigan and fitted pencil skirt with a chunky
        watch and spiky ear studs.[15]
    -   Spice up a plain, loose-fitting black shirt, black skinny jeans
        and black chunky ankle boots with a chunky gold chain necklace
        and diamond (or diamond-like) ear studs.
    -   Add a pop of color to an all-white ensemble with a colorful silk
        scarf a pair of silver hoops.[16]
4.  Play up your favorite attributes. Show off those long legs,
    accentuate that small waist or full bust, or choose a color that
    makes your eyes pop (or do all three!). Whatever you like best about
    your body, choose things that show that
    off.[17]![](Accessorize-Step-2-Version-2.jpg "fig:Accessorize-Step-2-Version-2.jpg")
    -   For example, make your legs look longer with a miniskirt or
        skinny jeans and heels in the same color.
    -   Alternatively, if you want to bring out your blue-grey eyes, add
        a blue-grey scarf to your outfit.
5.  Don’t be too put together. Leave that shirt partly untucked, or wear
    a pair of casual shoes with dressy slacks and a blazer. Looking too
    put together might make you look like you’re trying too hard, which
    can make you look less
    stylish.![](Stay-Safe-in-the-Sun-Step-11-Version-2.jpg "fig:Stay-Safe-in-the-Sun-Step-11-Version-2.jpg")
6.  Be stylish no matter what you’re doing. Stylish people always look
    stylish, whether they’re in their pyjamas, having low-key hangouts
    with friends, or out for a night on the town. With the right
    styling, you can look stylish even in skinny jeans and a
    T-shirt.![](Ask-a-Guy-to-Homecoming-Step-3-Version-2.jpg "fig:Ask-a-Guy-to-Homecoming-Step-3-Version-2.jpg")
    -   For example, pair black skinny jeans and a white V-neck T-shirt
        with a grey scarf, charcoal ankle boots, a black blazer, and
        silver hoop earrings.
7.  Be well-groomed. Having great-looking hair, eyebrows, skin, and
    nails will immediately boost your stylishness by making you look
    more put
    together.[18]![](Look-Like-Miranda-Kerr-Step-5.jpg "fig:Look-Like-Miranda-Kerr-Step-5.jpg")
8.  Ensure that you’re comfortable. No matter what you wear, make sure
    you feel comfortable in what you’re wearing. This will immediately
    boost your stylishness by making you look at ease in what you’re
    wearing.![](Snog-a-Boy-Step-2-Version-2.jpg "fig:Snog-a-Boy-Step-2-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Heels won’t accentuate an outfit if you look like you’re drunk
        or injured while you try to walk in them.[19]

## Tips

-   Read fashion magazines and blogs for inspiration.
-   If you love following the latest fashion trends, consider making the
    majority of your closet classic basics and then adding one or two
    trendy pieces per season just to dress those classic items up.
-   Experiment with makeup. A minimalistic natural look will always be
    popular, but you can also play with wilder looks as you explore your
    style.
-   Try different hairstyles to see how they complement your outfits.
    Loose wavy curls and high buns are popular styles right now.
-   If you feel really stuck when trying to build your own personal
    style, see if you can get help from a professional stylist. You
    should be able to find listings of stylists in your area online.
-   Some experts say that limiting how often they shop actually helps
    them keep a trimmer and more stylish closet. One supermodel claims
    to only shop 4 times a year, and to only buy 2 good pieces each
    season.[20]
-   Heels are a great way to add a little instant style boost to your
    outfit.[21]
-   Right now (early 2016) it’s popular to wear shoes that don’t
    obviously complement your outfit, for example, chunky leather shoes
    instead of ballet flats with a pair of fitted slacks or a
    miniskirt.[22]
-   Put on a little bit of natural makeup.

## Warnings

-   If you go to school/still live with your parents, make sure that
    they are okay with the clothes and makeup that you want to wear
    before you buy it.
-   If you love a trend but are on a budget, save money by shopping at
    cheaper shops like Forever21 or H&M. Trendy items aren’t meant to be
    worn for more than 1 or 2 seasons, so it doesn’t make sense for you
    to spend a lot of money on them.
-   Only buy clothes and shoes that fit and feel comfortable. If you’re
    not comfortable in them, you won’t wear them. They’ll just add
    clutter to your closet and make it more difficult to put outfits
    together.
-   Avoid impulse purchases, which will only clutter your wardrobe and
    take money away from your fashion budget.[23]
