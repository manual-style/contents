Have you ever wanted to be a surfer girl? Read on if you want a part of
that sun-kissed, [laid back](Be_Laid_Back "wikilink") style that makes
surfer girls so cool and irresistible.

## Steps

### Getting the Look

1.  Remember that the whole surfer look is one of carefree casualness.
    Nothing's too done, so don't spend ages on your hair - leave it be,
    put minimal makeup on (a bit of mascara, eyeliner, and lip gloss is
    fine) and wear casual
    clothes.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Try to get surfer girl hair. It is not true that all surfers have
    blonde hair because it is bleached from the sun. Brunettes don't go
    blonde just because they spend time in the sun. However, surfers do
    have lighter hair than others because they spend a lot of time in
    the sun and saltwater makes your hair lighter - think Fabiola
    Gatti.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_2.jpg")
    -   A good way to achieve this look is to mix one part of sea salt
        with three parts of water and spritz on your hair using an old
        hairspray bottle. It will give you that care-free "just surfed"
        look and is a good, natural alternative to dye if you can't
        actually go [surfing](Surf "wikilink") all the time. If your
        hair is naturally wavy or curly, embrace it - surfer hair is
        typically tousled. If it's naturally straight, after towel
        drying hair curl it in rags/french plait it and leave it
        overnight and it will be wavy by morning.
    -   There are some products on the market that boast 'surfer hair'
        so try these out and see what they do for. And also, if you have
        darker hair, or hair that's a little thicker, then you should
        try putting it in a braid, or braids. Put your hair in a bun, or
        a side ponytail, or just leave it down.
3.  Get a tan. It's essential for that laid-back, carefree look and
    looks flattering on almost everyone as it is an automatic slimmer
    and makes you look healthier and radiant. Real surfers have real
    beach tans, but of course, if you live in a climate where you need
    to wear a wet suit, it's very easy to get that unflattering 'wet
    suit tan' where past the neck you're completely
    white!![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Additionally you might live in a cooler climate not near the
        beach, or it might be winter, or you may get sunburn instead of
        tan. Here, the only solution is sunless tanning, either through
        a sunbed (not recommended), or [faking
        it](Get_a_Fake_Tan_That_Looks_Real "wikilink").
    -   Make sure you use a good quality tanner, exfoliating beforehand
        and moisturizing afterwards to prolong it. And if you have
        darker skin, then you don't have to tan, unless you still want
        to. But your skins already perfect for it.
4.  Sort out your wardrobe. Your clothes may include surf brands like
    Billabong and Roxy, but you shouldn't wear only surfing brands. Real
    surfers don't always live in beach brands, it can be too expensive
    and they're not always practical. The usual outfit for a surfer girl
    is board-shorts and a bikini, but for school or during cool weather,
    surf-inspired tops and jeans are a good
    look.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_4.jpg")
    -   Also, many surfer girls are bohemian in style and opt for the
        'boho chic' look (see Sienna Miller, Mary-Kate Olsen for ideas),
        which means gypsy inspired clothes, long skirts, maxi dresses,
        floral prints, lots of bangles and jewelry, and layered
        clothing. Girls in Hawaii usually wear lots of beach coverup
        dresses.
    -   What lots of girls wear are jean shorts with any tank, tee, or
        hoodie, with a neutral colored leather belt, trucker hat, and
        Vans or converse slip-ons, or flip-flops. While at the beach,
        wear a long pareo (sarong) tied loose and low around your hips.
        You can also use this item as a beach blanket or wrap up in it
        if you are cold. Always bring a pareo with you to the beach. You
        should always have:
    -   plenty of Denim shorts
    -   a few pairs of jeans
    -   lots of basic tank tops and tees
    -   a few sundresses in floral prints or bright colors
    -   2-3 cardigans
    -   2-3 hoodies
    -   2 pairs of cargo pants
    -   flattering bikini
    -   flip-flops
5.  Wear jewelry. Use bracelets made of hemp, rope, string, and
    seashells, and necklaces made of the same materials or rock
    pendants. You'll want to wear these 5 to 10 bracelets at a time so
    that they stack up your wrist. Bonus points if you get bracelets
    that can be worn in the water. Just note, you will get tan lines
    from
    them.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  [Paint your
    toenails](Paint_Your_Nails_Without_Making_a_Mess "wikilink") a
    bright color so your feet look nice. Remember they will be bare on
    the beach. Most surfers paint their nails. Good colors are bright
    colors; teal, aqua, orange, red, hot pink, and sunshine yellow. Also
    remember, sand and nail varnish don't mix. It gets scraped off
    really
    quickly.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_6.jpg")

### Living the Life

1.  Start spending more time at the beach or at the pool. Preferably the
    beach. If you don't live near one, encourage a group of mates to
    take up the sport with you and go on surfing trips to the coast
    occasionally. Book a campsite/stay at a surf lodge, have
    barbecues...they're really fun! If you're at a university see
    whether they have a surfing club or society. If not, start one!
    You'll probably get quite a lot of interest and then organizing
    trips to the coast will be a
    doddle.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Being a surfer girl requires you to be a surfer, as stated earlier.
    Go down to the coast and get some lessons, it's hard at first but
    once you get the hang of it, and the more you practice, the better
    you'll get! Surf hire is usually quite cheap, and if you've got a
    friend who can teach you, great! Or you can find a cute surfer guy
    willing to show you how...if not, there are so many places offering
    surfing
    lessons.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
    -   You have to know the basics of surfing, and a bunch of tricks.
        The main idea of being a surfer girl is to surf a lot! But make
        sure you also know the technical aspects, so you know what
        you're talking about when you get into a conversation with a
        surfer guy!
3.  Buy a super cool surfboard, preferably in bright colors. Have a
    surfboard that looks good with all your bathing suits. Remember, the
    colors don't matter as much as the quality of the board. Bad board
    with good pictures are bad. If you can't afford one then rent one
    while you save up! If you are a beginner, get a long surfboard, it
    catches waves easier and and quicker and also maneuvers easier. The
    more experienced you get, the shorter board you
    get!![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Get into shape. You'll want a beach body with all the time you'll be
    spending there! Of course, with all the surfing you'll be doing I'm
    sure this will come in time. Take up a beach sport like
    [volleyball](Play_Volleyball "wikilink"), or go running on the sand.
    It's great for your legs and allows you to check out the other
    surfers! Remember to eat as healthily as you can as
    well.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_10.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_10.jpg")
5.  Have the right attitude. Surfer girls are confident, optimistic and
    fun. They never take life too seriously, they're known to be cool
    people and down with everything. Be open-minded and be ready to try
    new things. If someone does something you don't agree with, don't
    start criticizing, let them do what they want, it's none of your
    concern - unless they're doing something that is hurting you or
    someone else, in which case it's good to stand up for yourself/them.
    If someone complains about you, take it in your stride - you can't
    please everyone. If someone's nasty to you, smile and
    shrug.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_11.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_11.jpg")
    -   The word to base your attitude on is 'chilled' - relax and take
        life as it rolls in with the waves. [Be a
        hippie](Be_a_Hippie "wikilink"). This doesn't mean you
        necessarily have to take the drugs though, even though smoking
        cannabis is glamourized in surfer movies and is part of the
        cultures, not all surfers do this.
6.  Listen to surf music. Generally choose music from the 60s - The
    Beach Boys of course are the epitome, but check out other artists
    such as Jan & Dean, The Surfaris, Dick Dale and The Trashmen. You
    can't beat a bit of reggae and ska either. Check out Sublime and
    Jack Johnson
    too.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_12.jpg")
7.  Practice yoga and pilates. One, it's important to improve balance
    and core strength which will help you when you're surfing, and
    secondly it's peaceful. Surfers are peaceful
    people.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_13.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_13.jpg")
8.  Be an environmentalist. If you're a surfer you care about nature and
    respect it. Recycle, and learn about ocean preservation and wildlife
    so you know what you're surfing in and try to protect
    it.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_14.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_14.jpg")
9.  Learn to play the acoustic guitar or ukulele. This is optional, but
    it's awesome when a girl can play guitar or ukulele, and
    sing-a-longs on the beach at sunset after a surf session are
    awesome. Even if you don't play well, practice a few well known
    songs. These would include Sublime songs such as Bad Fish and
    Santeria.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_15_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_15_Version_2.jpg")
10. Bag yourself a hot surfer boyfriend. Optional, but, let's face it,
    surfer guys are the hottest guys around, and it's nice to have
    someone to share the waves with you and then cuddle up to on the
    beach watching the sunset after your afternoon
    session...![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_16_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_16_Version_2.jpg")
11. Make sure to be yourself at *all* times and be the happiest person
    in the
    world.![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_17_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_17_Version_2.jpg")

## Tips

-   Don't just start surfing to pick up guys or just to make yourself
    look cool or popular. Only do it if you want to. Just be you.
-   Hygiene follows on from the above. Deodorant is a must as surfer
    girls are very active - surfing and playing volleyball. Shower
    daily, after surfing.
-   Make sure to take care of your skin and hair. Saltwater is great for
    your hair and makes it really soft after a while, but remember to
    wash too! And moisturize after every session to stop the sand, sun,
    and water drying out your skin. Nobody likes a flaky surfer girl.
-   Hang out with the boys. Surfer girls have a lot of guy friends
    because they share the beach with them. Be confident with them, and
    make sure you can surf and talk about surfing well enough - and
    they'll instantly know you for a surfer girl!
-   Dress subtly. You want to look like you aren't looking for
    attention, you just get it.
-   Don't swear. It's okay to use replacement words, like 'flippin' -
    but swearing is not cool or respectable, or at all attractive!
    Surfer girls are chilled and even though they may have that 'don't
    care' look and attitude, they are classy. They have no need for
    swearing.
-   Make friends with other surfers in your area. Surfing alone makes
    you look antisocial, and surfers are sociable people. Interact!
    Maybe you could go running with someone or join a volleyball game,
    or even get surfing lessons from your peers when you start out.
-   If you want to dress like a surfer, don't wear Hollister. It may
    seem like a surfer brand because they hang surfboards up and sell
    surfing magazines, but it's really not. If you go around telling
    people you surf and you're wearing Hollister, everyone will think
    you're a kook (inexperienced surfer). Wear Roxy, Quiksilver, Hurley,
    Vans, and more brand like that.
-   You won't get it the first time. It takes time. Don't give up. Find
    friends and family to support you big people that bring you down.

## Warnings

-   Don't wear **skinny jeans or pantyhose**. They are a nightmare when
    combined with sand and wet legs! The same goes for tight tops. Your
    only tight items of clothing should be your wetsuit and your bikini.
-   Be careful not to wear too many **surf brands** like Billabong,
    Roxy, Animal etc. as many of these are not functional surf clothes -
    they are just beach inspired. You need some technical clothes like
    board shorts, and also - normal clothes! Surfer girls don't have to
    just wear surf clothes! Anything that gives the impression you are a
    carefree, sunny, happy, conscientious and interesting person is
    clothing fit for a surfer girl. Summer dresses are good. Too many
    brands will make you look like a poser.
-   Wearing **too much make up** will give people the impression you're
    posing as a surfer to get some surfer guy attention. You don't
    really need any makeup at all - if you look healthy, you look hot!
    Beware of mascara running in the sea. Makeup and water don't mix!
-   **Don't forget to [have fun](Have_Fun "wikilink")**. Surfer girls
    are very fun people!
-   **Sun exposure** can cause premature aging, damage to hair and skin
    and cancer in later life. You must wear sun cream with SPF 30 AT
    LEAST. The higher the better. You **do not** want to get cancer in a
    few years, or, less seriously, get all wrinkly and nut-like before
    you're thirty. Not a good look or life ethic. Make sure your sun
    cream is waterproof - there are special surf ones designed for beach
    culture, where people spend lots of time in the sun and sea.
-   **Sun and sea** can damage your hair so make sure you take good care
    of it! Use products specially formulated for sun-exposed hair.
-   **Beware of sand!** It scrapes off nail polish, and gets everywhere.
    It takes several days to get it all off. Bear this in mind if
    there's a formal event coming up.
