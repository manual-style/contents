An Olden Day girl is one who loves the charm and romanticism of times
past, the elegance of ladies in beautiful clothes such as hooped skirts,
buttoned up tops, delicate shoes with bows and buttons, and hair dos
that show a lot of effort.

## Steps

1.  [Wear beautifully tailored
    clothes.](Be_Sophisticated_(for_Teens) "wikilink") Dresses are a
    must for an Olden Day girl. Look for well made dresses with plenty
    of fabric in the skirt area, and trimmings such as lace, buttons,
    bows, belts, sashes, embroidery, etc. Other suitable clothes include
    linen and lace shirts, linen jackets, mohair shawls, silk scarves
    and sashes, embroidered belts, petticoats, velvet bolero jackets,
    etc.![](Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_1.jpg")
2.  [Select quality shoes.](Buy_Shoes "wikilink") Olden Day girls didn't
    have many shoes but those the did have were of the best quality.
    Choose shoes that are of excellent quality and in shades that will
    match many of your clothes, such as browns and blacks. Suitable
    shoes will be detailed with buttons, bows, embroidery, laces,
    etc.![](Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_2.jpg")
3.  [Spend time doing your hair.](Style_Your_Hair "wikilink") Olden Day
    girls took time on their hair, putting it up in all manner of
    elaborate styles. Styles suitable to reflect the Olden Days include
    buns, braids, plaits folded over the scalp, ringlets, French rolls,
    and other intricate variations. Practice to see which ones are
    easiest for you in the shortest amount of time. Plaits and ponytails
    are permissible, but adorn them with big velvet or satin
    bows.![](Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_3.jpg")
4.  [Add accessories.](Accessorize "wikilink") Olden Day girls never
    went out without their hats and gloves on. Hats can be a very
    individual expression, with the inclusion of bows, feathers, floral
    art, ribbon, lace, etc. Gloves should be kept in top condition and
    exchanged quickly when they become tattered or
    soiled.![](Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_4.jpg")
5.  [Add jewelry.](Accessorize_With_Jewelry "wikilink") Olden Day girls
    didn't go overboard but preferred quality to quantity and
    flashiness. Look for pearls, rose gold chains and watches, cameos (a
    must!), brooches of animals and flora, jade, amber, and precious
    gems if you can afford
    it.![](Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Look in [thrift
    stores](Shop_Well_for_Clothes_in_a_Thrift_Store "wikilink"),
    consignment stores, costume stores, etc., for suitable finds.
    [Antique auctions](Buy_Antiques "wikilink") might also provide you
    with authentically old clothes. Treat these with much
    care!![](Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_6.jpg")
7.  [Have manners and know your
    etiquette.](Have_Good_Manners "wikilink") Olden Day girls knew how
    to charm through use of manners and correct etiquette. Spend some
    time reading up about manners and etiquette. Emily Post's book is a
    great
    start.![](Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_7.jpg "fig:Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_7.jpg")
8.  [Speak well.](Speak_Well_and_Confidently "wikilink") Elocution was
    an essential part of an Olden Day girl's education. Refuse to mumble
    or use common phrases; use precise and interesting words and speak
    clearly at all times. Be educated about the topics that you're
    speaking to by reading the news, analyzing the
    trends.![](Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_8.jpg "fig:Be_an_Olden_Day_Girl_Step_8.jpg")
