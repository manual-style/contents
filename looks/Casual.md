Being casual can mean a lot of things depending on whether you’re
referring to having a casual physical appearance, attitude, or dating
style. If you’re casual in appearance, you may dress more comfortably
and wear t-shirts, leggings, and/or denim. Those with a casual attitude
may have a carefree, relaxed, laid-back attitude and approach to most
situations. Casual dating typically involves easy-going, fun
interactions without the pressure of commitment or emotional investment.
To be more casual overall, try to dress, act and think, and/or date more
casually.

## Steps

### Dressing Casual

1.  Take advantage of Casual Friday at work. Friday at the office can be
    a great opportunity to hone your casual dressing skills if, of
    course, your company declares Fridays a casual day for dress. Men
    can try wearing dark jeans with a wool blazer and loafers. Women can
    take advantage of Casual Friday by wearing dark denim jeans or a
    skirt and a nice
    blouse.[1]![](Be_Casual_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Casual_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Try out a “smart casual look” at the office. The key to dressing
    smart casual is a chic ensemble that looks put together. Women can
    try a skirt and jacket over a brightly colored blouse accessorized
    with unique jewelry and a pair of closed toe pumps. Men can pair
    dressy slacks with brightly colored or patterned shirts and ties,
    topping off the look with a sports coat or jacket and a pair of
    monk-strapped shoes or
    loafers.[2]![](Be_Casual_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Casual_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Wear a “business casual” outfit to work. Men can rock the “business
    casual” look by wearing shirts and sweater in a variety of patterns
    and colors paired with slacks or corduroy pants and elegant, yet
    relaxed shoes. Women can try fashionable combinations of skirts,
    tops, vests, and slacks with closed or even open toe
    shoes.[3]![](Be_Casual_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Casual_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Look casual yet put together on the weekends. Dressing casually on
    the weekends doesn’t have to mean sweatpants and an old t-shirt.
    Women can dress casually on the weekends and still look put together
    by pairing distressed denim skirts or jeans with more refined pieces
    such as a nice handbag and coat. Men can try wearing nice jeans and
    a V-neck shirt topped with a sweater or sports
    coat.[4]![](Be_Casual_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Casual_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Try out an athleisure look. It is becoming increasingly acceptable
    to don your athletic wear on a regular basis as long as you’re not
    wearing it to work. Make sure you keep up with seasonal trends and
    accessorize appropriately. For example, you can try wearing leggings
    with a long sweater and a
    scarf.[5]![](Be_Casual_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Casual_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you are a student, be sure to consult your school’s dress
        code before wearing certain athleisure items to class.
6.  Wear comfortable fabrics. The key here is opting for fabrics that
    move with you, such as denim that contains spandex. This is a way to
    stay comfortable while looking great - you can be casual and
    comfortable while still looking put together. Try wearing stretchy
    jeans with your favorite comfy sweater and then accessorizing with a
    nice pair of earrings. You’ll come off as cool and casual while
    still feeling good in your
    clothes.![](Be_Casual_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Casual_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")

### Having a Casual Attitude

1.  Don’t take yourself too seriously. If you want to develop a casual
    attitude it’s important to not take yourself too seriously. Keep
    your sense of humor when unexpected things happen in your life and
    remember that you are a tiny fish in a big ocean. Your problems
    today will likely seem less important
    tomorrow.[6]![](Be_Casual_Step_11.jpg "fig:Be_Casual_Step_11.jpg")
2.  Go with the flow. This is especially important in group settings. If
    you want to have a casual attitude around friends, family, and even
    your co-workers, it’s important to go with the flow of the group.
    For example, if you are going to the movies with friends and
    everyone but you wants to see a certain flick, don’t push the issue.
    See the movie your friends want to see this
    time.![](Be_Casual_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_Casual_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Be careful to not be a pushover. Being casual doesn’t mean that
        you have to always agree with others. It’s okay to rock the boat
        and politely disagree when necessary.
3.  Try to relax. Part of having a casual attitude is learning how to
    slow down and relax. Instead of treating every minor mishap as a
    life-altering event, try to look at things in a broader perspective.
    Try breathing deeply when something unwanted occurs in your life
    instead of letting it ruin your
    day.![](Be_Casual_Step_13.jpg "fig:Be_Casual_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Feeling internally grounded and relaxed can help you develop a
        casual attitude. Practices like
        [meditation](Meditate_for_Beginners "wikilink") can teach you to
        be mindful, peaceful, and take on challenges with greater ease.

### Being Casual about Dating

1.  Be clear about your intentions. If you’re interested in dating
    someone casually as opposed to committing to a monogamous
    relationship, be sure you are clear about these intentions with the
    man or woman you are dating. Try saying, “Mark, I really enjoy
    spending time with you but I am not in a place for a serious,
    committed relationship. Can we keep it
    casual?”![](Be_Casual_Step_7.jpg "fig:Be_Casual_Step_7.jpg")
2.  Make sure you are both on the same page. It’s key that everyone’s on
    the same page about being in a casual relationship. Once you’ve made
    your intentions clear, talk with the other person about what is and
    what is not permissible in your casual relationship. You can try
    sitting down with them and making a list – paper or mental – of dos
    and don’ts such as sleeping with other
    people.[7]![](Be_Casual_Step_8.jpg "fig:Be_Casual_Step_8.jpg")
3.  Refrain from meeting each other’s friends and family. If you are
    involved in a casual relationship you shouldn’t be making the
    emotional investment of spending time with the important people in
    each other’s lives. Meeting and hanging out with someone’s best
    friends or parents should be reserved for a serious, committed
    relationship.[8]![](Be_Casual_Step_9.jpg "fig:Be_Casual_Step_9.jpg")
4.  Always practice safe sex. You should always practice safe sex and
    this is especially important if you are involved in a casual
    relationship where one or both of the partners may be having sex
    with other people. A sexually transmitted disease or unwanted
    pregnancy are the last things most casual daters want to deal with.
    Make sure you and your partners are using protection each and every
    time you have sex, which includes oral sex.[9]
