Finding a wedding dress can be a fun, occasionally stressful,
experience. If you want a modest wedding dress, decide on the basics.
Determine your budget and the cut you want. Not all bridal shops sell
modest dresses, so you may have to shop online or at stores affiliated
with a certain religion. Make sure you start your shopping early and
keep things like religious customs in mind when selecting a dress for
your wedding.

## Steps

### Deciding on the Basics

1.  Set your budget. Before buying any wedding dress, it's important to
    determine your budget. You should figure out the total cost of
    everything involved in the wedding and figure out how much you can
    set aside for a dress. If your parents or spouse's parents are
    paying for the wedding, discuss a reasonable budget with
    them.![](Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_1.jpg "fig:Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_1.jpg")
    -   Keep in mind you can always rent a dress if purchasing one is
        out of your budget.
2.  Decide on your sleeves. In general, most modest wedding dresses
    include some kind of sleeves. There are many different sleeve
    options for a wedding dress, so think about what kind of sleeves you
    want.[1]![](Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_2.jpg "fig:Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_2.jpg")
    -   If you want less in terms of sleeves, go for cap sleeves. These
        sleeves cover your shoulders but not your underarms.
    -   If you want more than cap sleeves but not full sleeves, a short
        sleeved dress can be great. It can also give your outfit a light
        romantic vibe. Short sleeved is considered any sleeve that's cut
        above the elbows.
    -   If you want a very long sleeve, go for an elbow length sleeve or
        a full sleeve.
3.  Think about texture. Modest wedding dresses come in a variety of
    textures. Select a texture that meets your needs as a
    bride.[2]![](Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_3.jpg "fig:Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_3.jpg")
    -   Lace is the most common texture for a wedding dress. It matches
        well with cap sleeves and can give your dress a vintage look.
    -   If you're looking for a dress that flows slightly, go for
        chiffon. It is also lightweight, which can help with comfort on
        your wedding day.
    -   If you want a bouncy or puffy wedding dress, tulle works well.
    -   Silk is a popular cut, but it is generally used for dresses that
        that are more fitted. If you want a modest wedding dress, you
        may not want a cut that's clingy.
4.  Select a modest fit. If you want a modest dress, you probably don't
    want something that's low cut, short, or very fitted. There are many
    options for a great cut for a modest wedding
    dress.[3]![](Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_4.jpg "fig:Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_4.jpg")
    -   Go for a longer dress. Something that's at least below your
        knees is great for a modest wedding dress.
    -   A ball gown gives a fairy tale vibe to your wedding and is
        generally not too revealing. If you want something that
        highlights your figure more, without being overly revealing, try
        a mermaid cut.
    -   If a mermaid dress feels too revealing, a fit and flare dress
        can be a great in between. It shows off some of your figure
        without being as clingy as a mermaid cut.

### Searching in the Right Places

1.  Start your search early. For any wedding dress, it's good to start
    your search early. It can be difficult to find the exact type of
    dress that fits your vision for your wedding and almost all types of
    dresses require some alterations. Tailoring usually takes six to
    eight months, so begin your search about a year before your wedding
    date.[4]![](Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_5.jpg "fig:Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_5.jpg")
2.  Try your luck shopping locally. If you're lucky, you can find a
    dress locally. This way, you can get advice from store workers and
    try your dress on before purchasing it to make sure it
    fits.[5]![](Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_6.jpg "fig:Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_6.jpg")
    -   Make appointments with a variety of local providers in your
        area. Take an afternoon to visit a variety of shops to explore
        dress options.
    -   Keep in mind it is sometimes hard to find modest cuts from local
        sellers.
3.  Seek online sellers. It can be difficult to find a modest dress
    locally, so do not disregard online retailers. There are many stores
    online that have a section specifically for modest dresses. You may
    also be able to find a dress at an online store that specifically
    sells modest
    dresses.[6]![](Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_7.jpg "fig:Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_7.jpg")
    -   You will have to send in your measurements to make sure your
        chosen dress fits. Take your measurements yourself or have
        someone else take them for you.
    -   Almost all wedding dresses need alterations. Even if you send in
        your correct measurements, you will probably have to get the
        dress altered. Remember to shop early.
4.  Look into religious stores. If there are stores in your area that
    sell dresses for religious weddings, this may be a good place to
    find a more modest dress. Certain religions, like Mormonism, have
    specific requirements for wedding dresses in terms of modesty. Even
    if you are not religious yourself, it may be worth it to stop by a
    dress store affiliated with a particular church. You may be able to
    find a more modest wedding dress this
    way.[7]![](Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_8.jpg "fig:Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_8.jpg")
5.  Try having a less modest gown altered. If you can't find a modest
    wedding dress that suits your needs, you can always alter a less
    modest one. If you, for example, find a dress with the right sleeves
    and the right style but feel it's too low cut, you can pay to have
    it altered. Do not stress too much about finding the perfect
    dress.[8]![](Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_9.jpg "fig:Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_9.jpg")

### Avoiding Common Mistakes

1.  Think about comfort in addition to appearance. You want a dress
    that's comfortable. In addition to appearance, try on a variety of
    dresses and find one that feels right. Nothing can sour a wedding
    day more than a dress that's too tight, itchy, or
    warm.[9]![](Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_10.jpg "fig:Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_10.jpg")
2.  Take any religious customs into account. If you're seeking a modest
    dress for religious reasons, make sure you know any specific rules
    of your religion. For example, some sects of Mormonism require your
    collarbone be covered in the temple. Before selecting your dress,
    make sure you know all religious
    customs.![](Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_11.jpg "fig:Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_11.jpg")
3.  Buy a dress that fits now. You may be planning to lose a few pounds
    before your wedding day. This is a worthwhile goal, but you may not
    reach your precise goal in time for your wedding. It's much easier
    to have a dress that's too big altered than try to squeeze into a
    dress that's too small on your wedding
    day.[10]![](Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_12.jpg "fig:Choose_a_Modest_Wedding_Dress_Step_12.jpg")
