You know that dress in the back of your closet that always makes you
feel like Cinderella at the ball? You love it because it's glamorous,
but wish it would show just a little less cleavage. A few simple tricks
will help you sport that low-cut number with confidence.

## Steps

### Choosing a Modest Bra

1.  Invest in a [bralette](Wear_a_Bralette "wikilink"). A bralette is a
    bra that has no padding or underwire. Free from all the usual bra
    trappings, you don’t have to worry about your cleavage taking over
    the
    night.![](Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_1.jpg "fig:Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_1.jpg")
    -   If this still isn’t cutting it, you can go a step further and
        choose a lace bralette. This version of the bralette is edged in
        lace and is meant to be worn in public, rather than buried
        beneath a shirt. The lace will help cover your cleavage and add
        a romantic touch to your dress.[1]
2.  Wear a bandeau for a layered look. It’s made of stretchy material
    and doesn’t waste its time on extra padding. Similar to the
    bralette, bandeaus are meant to meet the public eye, and will help
    you achieve a lovely layered
    look.[2].![](Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_2.jpg "fig:Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_2.jpg")
    -   You can also use your bandeau to create a color contrast -
        brighten a black dress with a hot pink bandeau or temper a red
        dress with a black bandeau. You could also consider coordinating
        your bandeau with other accessories like shoes.
3.  Try a high neck bra. High neck bras often tie at the neck and look
    like halters or come with a detachable decorative portion that
    slides conveniently in front of your cleavage. Not only will this
    bra cover your cleavage, it will give an edge to even the most
    boring
    dress.[3]![](Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_3.jpg "fig:Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_3.jpg")

### Choosing a Concealing Undergarment

1.  Layer a lace camisole under your dress. Camisoles are basically
    tiny, body-fit tank tops. Regular camisoles will work too, but their
    appeal is informal, so if your dress is on the fancy side opt for
    the lace version instead. Also, some camisoles have a bra built in,
    allowing you to skip the bra entirely – whether this is to your
    advantage or not depends on the
    dress.[4]![](Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_4.jpg "fig:Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_4.jpg")
2.  Do-it-yourself with a sewn-in cleavage cover. Choose a strong, thin
    material such as spandex or Lycra. These fabrics ten to provide
    support but also allow for
    movement.![](Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_5.jpg "fig:Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_5.jpg")
    -   You can also consider lace, but you would want to bind two
        layers together in order for the material to be strong
        enough.[5]
    -   From there you will need to find a cleavage cover pattern. You
        can find plenty of free cleavage cover patterns online.
        Pinterest and sewing blogs are a great place to start your
        search.
3.  Put on a snap-on bra overlay for an easy solution. This convenient
    triangle of fabric snaps right into your bra. The lace versions of
    these are especially apt for pairing with dresses. Be sure to
    consider what kind of fabric the overlay is made out of as some
    materials can be itchy and will be more of a nuisance than a
    help.[6]![](Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_6.jpg "fig:Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_6.jpg")

### Covering up with Accessories and Outerwear

1.  Accessorize with a webbed necklace. Webbed necklaces work great
    since they tend to cover more skin. You can always use some fashion
    tape to pin the necklace in place if you are planning on
    dancing.[7]![](Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_7.jpg "fig:Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_7.jpg")
2.  Wear a scarf for a simple fix. A scarf can add elegance, texture,
    and color to your outfit. Avoid bulky and multi-colored scarves that
    will overwhelm, instead of highlight, your dress. Silk scarves in
    particular will give your dress that extra romantic
    edge.[8]![](Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_8.jpg "fig:Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_8.jpg")
    -   Looping your scarf in a waterfall shape, rather than tying it,
        will allow for the best coverage.
3.  Sport a shawl for a classy look. Shimmy in style (and worry-free)
    when you pair your dress with a shawl. You will want to find a shawl
    that has a triangle front. The triangle lays right over your
    cleavage so there is no need for any special pinning or
    folding.[9]![](Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_9.jpg "fig:Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_9.jpg")
4.  Pair it with a pashmina. Feeling fancy? Add a pashmina to your dress
    and you will be the poshest lady on the block. While you can fold a
    pashmina in many ways, the best option for covering cleavage is to
    fold your pashmina into a top. Simply wrap the pashmina around your
    front and then bring it back over the shoulder and let the remaining
    fabric
    drape.[10]![](Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_10.jpg "fig:Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_10.jpg")
5.  Try a cute coat. A small decorative jacket has three functions:
    bringing your dress to life, covering your cleavage, and keeping you
    warm on cold nights. Find a coat whose color complements your dress
    and you are on your
    way!![](Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_11.jpg "fig:Cover_Cleavage_in_a_Low_Cut_Dress_Step_11.jpg")

## Tips

-   Whether it’s a new bralette, a new scarf, or a new camisole, be sure
    you try it out before going out. While many of these options will
    cover your cleavage, they may also leave your chest looking lumpy or
    shapeless. Try the clothes on and be sure you aren’t trading one
    faux-pas for another.[11]
