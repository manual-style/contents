Crossdressing is the act of blurring the aesthetic gender lines by
wearing clothing traditionally worn by the opposite sex.[1] Men can
dress to look like women, while women can dress like men. This may be
done by people who enjoy cross-dressing periodically as well as those
who choose to adopt an identity as the other gender. It can also be
handy for people such as actors who may be called upon to play another
gender in a role. While there is no right or wrong way to crossdress,
this article can be used as a guide through the complicated process of
switching your gender through the garments you choose to wear.

## Steps

### Men to Women

1.  Pick a role model. Successfully pulling off a male-to-female gender
    transformation will depend on picking a feminine body type to
    emulate. Women all have feminine curves, but differ in how it is
    presented. A petite gymnast will be different than a voluptuous
    vamp, which will also be completely different than a sweet little
    old lady.![](Crossdress_Step_1.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_1.jpg")
    -   When picking a role model to emulate, it is easier to pick a
        feminine figure who has the same general body type as you.
        -   Marilyn Monroe, for example, is a good example of a woman
            with an hourglass figure, not particularly thin, and medium
            height.
        -   Portraying Brienne of Tarth on Game of Thrones can use a
            more muscular build.
        -   Of course, accuracy may not be the point. If dressing for
            comedic effect, feel free to go for the exact opposite. An
            example would be putting a large muscular man in a fairy
            costume.
2.  Contour your face. Your facial features say a lot about your gender,
    and there are measurable physical differences between the two. You
    will want to imply higher cheekbones and a smaller chin, and of
    course, you will want to shave *very*
    closely.[2]![](Crossdress_Step_5.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_5.jpg")
    -   As women throughout the ages have discovered, the right kind of
        contouring makeup can create an entirely different facial look.
        You can create illusions that make features looks smaller or
        more pronounced and you can even draw focus to certain feminine
        or masculine traits.
    -   Feminine face: To get those higher cheekbones, larger eyes,
        smaller noses, and bigger lips that are strong gender cues, use
        contouring powder and highlighter.
    -   Add makeup to mask or modify your features to appear more
        feminine. Apply false lashes, mascara, blush, eyeshadow,
        eyeliner and lipstick to create the ultimate feminine look.
3.  Accentuate your bust. Entire industries, from garments to cosmetic
    surgery to publishing empires, have been built on the foundation of
    our association with breasts and femininity. For convincing cross
    dressing, this will help bring you where you want to be, both
    physically and
    emotionally.![](Crossdress_Step_3.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_3.jpg")
    -   One way to do this is to purchase a bra and stuff it with either
        tissue paper or socks. If you're not interested in showing
        cleavage, this will work well. If you want cleavage as well as
        natural-looking bounce, weight, feel, and movement, you can
        purchase a breast form[3], which is a prosthesis you wear inside
        the bra or attached to your body.
    -   If you're going for a natural look, *avoid exaggerating the size
        of your breasts*—make them proportional to your body size, or
        even a little smaller. Too much bust actually detracts from a
        natural appearance.
4.  Draw in the waist. The contrast between the waistline and hips
    promotes a feminine look.[4] While some styles downplay this look
    (such as flapper dresses) drawing attention to a smaller waistline
    helps the overall
    effect.![](Crossdress_Step_4.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_4.jpg")
    -   Waist-cinching undergarments or corsets can help to achieve a
        more [hourglass
        figure](Work-out-What-Body-Shape-You-Have "wikilink"). You can
        also add padded panties, or silicone butt pads to bump the
        badonkadonk.
    -   Tuck and tape the boys. While there is expensive underwear that
        can disappear your package faster than a fly-by-night delivery
        service, you an also do this easily and cheaply with a pair of
        panty hose and some tape (medical tape, not duct tape—please,
        for your own sake!)[5] Visit this wikiHow article on [How to
        Tuck and Tape](Tuck-and-Tape "wikilink") for more information.
5.  Do your hair up. While you can grow out your hair to naturally get
    the look of the opposite sex, you can also take advantage of wigs to
    create that look temporarily, and try out different looks and colors
    to find one that suits you. Look online at celebrities to find the
    right hairdo for your new
    features.![](Crossdress_Step_6.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_6.jpg")
6.  [Dress the part](Find-Clothing-As-a-Cross-Dressing-Man "wikilink").
    Get the right fit by trying on your clothes that match your figure.
    You don't want to buy a dress only to find out it doesn't fit with
    your new cleavage. Take your measurements to determine your
    needs:![](Crossdress_Step_7.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_7.jpg")
    -   Your chest is measured with the tape snug under your arms and
        above the cups of your bra.
    -   Measure your bust across the fullest part of your bra cups.
        Don't pull the tape too tight—you don't want to squish things
        down unnaturally here.
    -   Measure your waist at the narrowest part, between the top of the
        hipbone and the bottom of your rib cage.
    -   Your hips are measured at the largest part of your butt and
        hips.
    -   A rule of thumb when buying a dress is to use the largest of the
        measurements for your dress size.
7.  Pay attention to the smaller details. It's more than just how a man
    dresses or a woman does her make up that makes them identifiable
    with that gender. There are dozens of little differences, red flags
    that signal that you are a cross dresser. If you are looking for the
    obvious cross-dressing look, you can skip past these tips. If you
    want to look like a woman down to the smallest details, read
    on!![](Crossdress_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Exposed body hair: Men and women expose body hair differently.
        Waxing, using pantyhose or shaving can turn a man into a more
        realistic woman. Eyebrows are key as well, and sculpted eyebrows
        will go a long way towards a convincing look. It will also be
        one of the more noticeable features when you're not
        cross-dressed, which might be a concern.
    -   Nails: This is an obvious, but a sometimes overlooked detail.
        Give yourself a manicure to achieve the look you want.
    -   Accessories: Belts, necklaces and earrings aren't unisex. Keep
        your accessory shopping to the women's departments.
8.  Get the attitude. Being a cross dresser may be all about the
    aesthetics to you. If so, the following tips may not mean much. But
    if you want to pull off the entire gender persona, its important to
    have the right act
    down.![](Crossdress_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Develop the personality. In reality, women have all sorts of
        behavior patterns--but certain ones are emphasized in females.
        Women are taught to be less aggressive, for example. They are
        also allowed to be more emotional than male counterparts.
    -   For example, a woman would be more likely at a restaurant to
        say, "I would like a salad, please," instead of "I want the
        salad."
    -   Women tend to show more emotion. Men are generally taught to
        avoid a lot of visible emotion, while a woman tends to be
        allowed to.
    -   Alter your voice. For starters, you can bring the pitch of your
        voice up higher to convey a feminine voice. It's also important
        to also adopt the vocabulary associated with the fairer sex.
        Note that speaking in a falsetto voice will not be convincing
        for long. Learn to speak in a softer, more sing-song way,
        varying your pitch and volume more than you do when speaking as
        a man.
    -   Walk the walk. Men and women often walk differently,[6] and a
        lot of it is taught by culture. Your movement is ingrained, and
        you've learned to "walk like a man" since you were a boy. Women
        have to learn to walk in a feminine way, which emphasizes grace
        rather than power. As a man, you have to switch gears.
    -   Practice walking in heels. Nothing looks less feminine than
        tottering on high heels. Even if you do not go out in public in
        heels high heels teach balance, smaller stride, walking softly,
        and a feminine gait. Practice going up and down stairs
        especially. Being fully proficient with heels means being able
        to not only walk, but dance in this type of footwear.
    -   Women often walk faster and use their arms more, so try picking
        up the pace, and engaging your arms. Arms are soft, not hard and
        stiff.
    -   As the song says, "hips don't lie," so sway your hips subtly,
        but don't do it to the point of exaggeration.
    -   Be careful to walk with gentleness. Men are allowed to clomp
        down the hall and pound downstairs in a way that women are not.
        Women are taught to walk more carefully with a grace. Walk up
        and down stairs with a skirt, and keep in mind a woman cannot
        bring her knees up very high.

### Women to Men

1.  Find a role model. Find a male archetype or two to get your cues
    from. Using archetypes will help you with style cues, movement,
    attitude, and that all-important
    swagger.![](Crossdress_Step_10.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Choose guys with features that are roughly similar to yours, or
        you'll have a hard time making the switch convincing.
2.  Tuck in your breasts. Breasts are a giveaway if you're trying to
    look like a man. If you want to be convincing, they have got to go
    undercover.![](Crossdress_Step_12.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_12.jpg")[7]
    -   Usually this can be achieved by wearing form-reducing
        underclothes that can smooth out the look. A sports bra that is
        two sizes too small for you, or a control top made from a cut up
        pair of panty hose; can give you a flatter and smoother look.
3.  Flatten out the curves. Guys tend to have broader shoulders, and
    more of a straight line between the rib cage and hips—with narrower
    hips in general. The goal here is to add padding to both the
    shoulders and waist, and to visually de-emphasize the
    hips.![](Crossdress_Step_13.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Wear looser clothing to help de-emphasize curves, in general.
    -   Going to the gym can create a more masculine figure by targeting
        specific muscle groups. Build your chest, arms and legs to
        create more "bulk" on the body.
    -   Padding at the waist can be done to look realistic by adding
        bulk with extra fabric. There are prosthetic devices available
        as well. It doesn't take much, just enough to reduce the
        appearance of wider hips.
4.  Contour your facial features. Women's faces tend to be smaller and
    rounder, with less-prominent chins and noses. You can use makeup to
    help mask a feminine face, but it will be more about attitude than
    look, if you want to be
    convincing.![](Crossdress_Step_14_Version_2.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_14_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Men have smaller lips, larger noses, bigger eyebrows, lower
        cheekbones and a more pronounced jawline. Use contouring powder
        to create heavier looking features.[8] Don't use any additional
        makeup to add color to the face. Adding "facial hair" can make a
        large difference in your look, but be cautious—it won't stand up
        to close scrutiny. Consider adding a high-quality mustache or
        goatee for a more convincing look. Even men with naturally
        sparse facial hair can often grow those. Just don't make it look
        like an overgrown bush, or it will look fake.
    -   Build the perfect package. If you think about a roll of
        quarters, you'll have the average size about right—though you
        will want to adjust the proportions depending on your own
        physical attributes. However, while a roll of quarters might
        give you the right dimensions, but you will look like you're
        permanently ready for action. Consider stuffing with a sock, or
        even considering a prosthetic penis. If you use a wool sock, you
        may inadvertently set yourself up for a typical guy cue:
        scratching the itch.
5.  Get a haircut. Short hair on women is generally OK in 21st-century
    culture, especially in locations where cross-dressing is acceptable,
    so there shouldn't be a big issue with trimming your
    locks.![](Crossdress_Step_15.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_15.jpg")
    -   If for whatever reason you want to keep your hair, use a
        short-haired wig.
6.  Dress the part. Men's jeans are a sure way to de-emphasize your
    female shape. By keeping it looser in the butt, you'll also minimize
    recognition from behind. In general, a looser fit in your clothes
    will work to your advantage. However, if you want to look more
    sophisticated and tailored, make sure the clothes are cut to fit a
    man's shape—then back-fill with padding and minimizing to achieve
    the right
    look.![](Crossdress_Step_16.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_16.jpg")
7.  Pay attention to the smaller details. While first impressions go a
    long way to establishing your identity, a lasting impression will
    work only if you fine-tune the
    details.![](Crossdress_Step_17.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_17.jpg")
    -   Exposed body hair. Let your leg and underarm hair grow
        naturally. With the exception of Olympic swimmers and
        competitive cyclists, guys don't shave there.
    -   Trim your nails. This is an obvious but a sometimes-overlooked
        detail. Give yourself a manicure to achieve the look you want.
        Keeping your fingernails trimmed down so that a sliver of white
        shows will help. Don't trim into the quick or you'll look like a
        nervous wreck.
    -   Accessories: While lots of guys wear necklaces, bracelets, and
        earrings, most guys don't. Since the goal is to avoid being
        taken for a woman, avoid such trappings. If you *do* decide to
        go with jewelry, shop in the men's department.
8.  Be the man. If you want to pull off the entire gender persona, its
    important to have the right "act"
    down.![](Crossdress_Step_18_Version_2.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_18_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Develop the personality. Think of what kind of man you want to
        be. Based on that, you may want to alter some of your basic
        personality traits. Try being more aggressive, and being direct
        when you want something instead of being nice. For example, to
        quench your thirst when dining out, say "Excuse me, we'd like
        some water here, please." instead of "Hi! Yes, may I please have
        a glass of water? Thank you so much!" For a man, it's not a
        question, even when framed as a question.
    -   Alter the voice. Bring down your voice to become more like a
        man. Also speak more like a man speaks—louder, more flat-toned,
        and more clipped. Guys also tend to slur their words, saying "I
        gotta have that car," where a woman would more likely say "I
        *must* have those shoes!" It's also important to adopt the
        vocabulary associated with the opposite sex. Nothing is ever
        "fabulous," "adorable," or "precious." It also helps if you have
        a prominent Adam's apple.
    -   Talking the talk? Now walk the walk. Slow it down. Men swing
        their arms less and walk slower, and keep their hips from
        swaying. Take longer strides, and exude confidence. Have a 'I
        know where I'm going' rather than a 'time to check the map
        again' attitude in the little things you do.
9.  Put it all together. Talk the talk, walk the walk, dress the part,
    play the role, and be the
    man!![](Crossdress_Step_19.jpg "fig:Crossdress_Step_19.jpg")

## Tips

-   Try it out. Before you go about investing in a particular look, it's
    best to try crossing dressing in smaller steps. For example, don't
    go investing in an entire wardrobe of bras before you even decide if
    you feel comfortable wearing them—a lot of cross dressers don't.
    Similarly, if you are a woman, try "padding" your underwear at home
    before you commit to wearing it for an entire night out, you could
    find it to be all too uncomfortable.
-   Get emotionally there. Cross dressing isn't just about the look, it
    is about the emotions that you get switching between the "feminine"
    and "masculine" aesthetic. If you are having concerns or feel like
    you need more support, try looking online for cross dressing blogs
    or chat rooms. This could make all the difference in your confidence
    as a cross-dresser!
-   Ask a trusted friend of the opposite sex to help. They can give you
    tips that you might not have thought of.
-   This is best to do at Halloween, then you don't get as many stares.
-   For women cross dressing as men, walk with your feet farther apart
    (not too far though). For men cross dressing as women, walk with one
    foot in front of the other to sway your hips.
-   Chances are that it will take you quite a while to become
    convincingly opposite. Practice makes perfect.
-   For women crossdressing as men, sag your pants a little to
    de-emphasize your rear-end.
-   If you need help trying to sound like a boy/girl, listen to them
    talk (try not to be creepy) and take notes.

## Warnings
