Casual chic is not so much a style as an attitude towards fashion. It
allows you to look stylish and laid-back without looking too "done-up."
It is great for getting together with friends, going out on errands, and
casual parties. Wear casual chic anywhere you want to look good, but
still save yourself hours of effort (or bundles of cash).

## Steps

### Choosing Tops

1.  Think about wearing layers, not individual pieces. Layering is a key
    tip in pulling off street-style. Carefully chosen basics are
    powerful fashion staples because you can combine them in many
    different ways. A nice t-shirt or tank top may not be much on its
    own, but throw on a nice blazer or cardigan and you'll be getting
    somewhere. Remember: casual chic is about being relaxed but still
    stylish, and layering allows you to feel comfortable but still mix
    and match unique
    styles.![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   1-2 nice, light jackets can allow you to wear your t-shirts out
        to many occasions and still look good.
2.  Aim for neutral colors. Blacks, grays, whites, and tans are your
    friends here – they can be easily mixed and matched with other
    colors and accessories. Casual chic isn't so much about making an
    eye-popping statement as it is about looking relaxed and comfortable
    with your style. Using muted or neutral colors as your base opens
    you up for bigger splashes of color down the
    road.![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
3.  Get a few nice t-shirts. While you don't want to wear your old
    lacrosse warm-up shirt, a few nice graphic tees are essential to
    casual chic. Make sure they don't have any stains, that they fit you
    well, and that they haven't become discolored with age. Tees can be
    easily mixed and matched with other pieces, and the logos or designs
    can be tailored to fit your
    interests.![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
4.  Invest in some jackets, sweaters, and overlayers. Not only does this
    allow you to look casual chic all year, it gives you the chance to
    personalize and "upgrade" your tees and tanks quickly and
    easily.![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   A sweater, usually bigger or baggier is better.
    -   A denim shirt/jacket
    -   A flannel shirt
    -   A form-fitting blazer in white or gray.
    -   2-3 cardigans in various colors.
5.  Try out some button-up shirts. Button ups are great because they
    look dressed-up, but can still be worn completely casually. Try to
    find one that fits your well and open up the top 1-2 buttons. You
    can leave it untucked with a nice pair of jeans and touch it up with
    an accessory or two for effortless casual
    chic.![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")

### Choosing Bottoms

1.  Invest in a good, well-fitting pair of jeans. Jeans are at the top
    of the list when it comes to essential casual chic clothing. A good
    pair of jeans is comfortable and hugs your hips and backside, but
    searching for the perfect pair isn't always easy. Everyone is a
    different body shape, so when you're trying on jeans from different
    companies, you should consider trying on a pair a size up and a size
    down from the one you normally
    where.![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Once you've got your pair of nice denim jeans, look into
        dark-wash or black jeans. You can use these to slightly "dress
        up" your casual chic.
2.  Find 2-3 skirts that you love. Pair them with leggings or simply
    wear them alone for a simple and comfortable look. As with tops, you
    should aim for mostly neutral colors, though a few popping patterns
    can be paired wonderfully with a neutral top and/or a nice baggy
    sweater.![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Think about leggings. Both comfortable and versatile, leggings go
    great with a long, flowing shirt or even a shorter dress. Having the
    leggings not only makes the outfit more comfortable, it downplays
    some of the "showy" aspects of the dress to make it seem more
    casual.![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Try out distressed pants. Light wear and tear will definitely get
    across the idea of casual, opening you up to wear a nice top to
    bring in the "chic." A lot of casual chic is about mixing and
    matching "classy" clothes with a more laid-back, comfortable piece,
    and distressed pants and shorts (like white/beige cutoffs) are a
    great place to
    start![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Wear shorts in nice weather. Jean shorts, cutoffs, and even the
    occasional pair of nice running shorts can all look good when the
    weather is getting toasty. Again, aim for pieces that are easy to
    mix and match: beige, white, tan, denim, and black all pair well
    with a variety of tops.

### Shoes and Accessories

1.  Aim to wear more flats. You can still wear heels for casual chic,
    but flats are a more comfortable option that can still boast a lot
    of style. Some shoes to try
    include:![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
    -   A pair of black-heeled pumps.
    -   A pair of beige ankle booties
    -   A pair of strappy sandals in a color of your choice
    -   A pair of brown leather or suede boots.
    -   A pair of nice sneakers or Converse high-tops.
2.  Make the outfit pop with 1-2 accessories. Casual chic enables you to
    combine the most comfortable clothes from your wardrobe and do a
    little mix-and-match with accessories. The best accessories include
    simple everyday items such as sunglasses, hats, scarves, belts, and
    purses/bags/totes. Some suggestions
    include:![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
    -   1-2 scarfs in semi neutrals, i.e. blue,burgundy.
    -   A oversized black leather handbag
    -   A cream envelope clutch
    -   A pair of golden framed mirrored aviator sunglasses, or a pair
        of regular large black sunglasses.
3.  Get a little bling in your life. You can also take jewelry, even
    basic rings, bracelets, and necklaces, and use them to give subtle
    accents to your outfit. Casual chic doesn't need to look expensive,
    so don't worry about getting a $350 necklace to look
    good.![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Care for your hair. The beauty of casual chic is that you don't have
    to put hours of work into a hairstyle. Take care of your hair with
    daily conditioner and regular washing – this should be enough. Try
    putting your hair in a sleek ponytail, half up, in a loose bun – or
    just leave it down. You can keep it straight, curly, or wavy, but
    make sure that it isn't
    frizzy.![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_14_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_14_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Wear the right style of makeup. If you are going to look casual,
    your makeup needs to be casual as well. Use tinted moisturizer or
    light coverage foundation to make your skin look dewy/glowing. Apply
    light foundation, a little bit of powder (if you need it), bronzer,
    white shimmer (to put in the corner of your eyes and to highlight
    the brow bone), and a touch of
    mascara.![](Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_15_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casual_Chic_Step_15_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Again, you don't need to go overboard. Simply touch up your
        facial skin and elongate your eyelashes a bit to look casual but
        put-together.

## Tips

-   A pair of pumps are much more relaxed than heels
-   Try big curls this adds to your chic style.
-   Look at programs like 90210 for inspiration.
-   Smoky brown eyeshadow is a good natural-ish way to glam up.
-   An oversize cardigan is very casual and cool.
-   Don't wear makeup if your parents/school doesn't allow you to.

## Warnings

-   Don't overdo it and go too slobbish. Tracksuit bottoms, trainers and
    a tank isn't chic, it's too casual. Neither is mini skirt, halter
    top, strappy heels, which is more of a clubbing outfit more often
    than not.
