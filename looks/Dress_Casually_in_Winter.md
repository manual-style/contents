Sometimes winter can drag you down into a fashion rut. But you don't
need to give up on your sense of style during the colder months! Instead
of wearing the same parka each day, you can opt for a smart casual look
that will keep you warm and have you looking good!

## Steps

### Choosing Warm and Cozy Statement Pieces

1.  Sort through your closet. It's always best to start by taking stock
    of what you already have. By sorting through your clothing, you may
    discover old favorites that are practical for winter. You can
    rediscover forgotten items and make them easily accessible for cool,
    casual
    outfits.![](Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Storing away your summer clothing will give you more space for
        bulky winter items.
2.  Select a few key statement pieces, focusing on outerwear and
    accessories. These pieces will be on heavy rotation throughout the
    colder months.[1] You can get a lot of mileage out of just a few
    pieces of outerwear and accessories which can be combined for
    different
    looks.![](Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Invest in a statement coat. Winter greys can really bring you down.
    But finding a big, colorful coat can top any outfit and make you
    stand out from a crowd! Consider a fun print, such as plaid, or a
    bright
    color![2]![](Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Belted coats draw attention to the waistline and are very
        flattering on any body type.
4.  Slip on some cozy boots. Shoes can make or break and outfit. Buying
    a pair of warm winter boots with rubber soles will keep your feet
    happy and dry, not to mention give your outfit an extra boost. There
    are many options for warm, yet stylish winter
    boots.[3]![](Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Furry, suede boots are the ultimate comfy snow day outfit.
    -   Combat boots can give your look a more punk feel.
5.  Wrap yourself up in a big scarf. Scarves are versatile accessories
    and add a burst of color and texture to any outfit. An oversized
    scarf for winter is the perfect outfit
    topper.[4]![](Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")

### Styling a Business Casual Look

1.  Pair your tailored pieces with a vest or chunky knit. Down vests
    give your outfit a sporty look, while vests made of fur or fake fur
    are more chic. A large knit scarf can also dress down a more
    polished look. These options will keep you toasty while still
    looking
    professional.![](Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Choose a fashion-forward blazer. Blazers streamline any look and add
    a layer of warmth. You can choose a blazer in a heavier fabric, such
    as velvet or tweet, to really stand
    out.[5]![](Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
    -   An eye-catching scarf can brighten up a dark blazer.
3.  Pair a midi sweater dress with warm tights. The midi length is an
    absolute must-have this season! Extend its life into the winter by
    layering thick tights or leggings to create a perfect, easy winter
    look that still looks polished enough for the
    office.[6]![](Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Experiment by pairing black and tan. Black and tan are a classic
    combination that always look chic. By pairing a black outfit with a
    tan coat, you'll be ready for a photo op! Alternatively, pairing a
    black top with camel bottoms is also a sharp look.

### Putting Together Casual, Off-Duty Looks

1.  Top your outfit with several different layers. Whether for a weekend
    hangout or a quick trip to the grocery store, you can experiment
    with different layers. For example, you might want to wear a
    turtleneck under a blouse or shirt for a cozy outfit. Or perhaps
    throw a chunky cardigan over a lighter sweater for an on-trend
    look![8]![](Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
    -   A flannel shirt can be a great look to show off your more rugged
        side, or paired with combat boots, can be more grunge.[9]
2.  Break out your warmest, furriest boots. You can comfortably wear
    suede booties and furry moccasins to create a more rustic look. Your
    feet will thank
    you![10]![](Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Top your outfit with a teddy coat. These big, comfy coats look like
    a stuffed animal and are on point this season. They are the ultimate
    elevated basic and can take even a plain outfit to the next
    level.[11]![](Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Try a monochromatic look with one accessory. Wearing a single color
    makes you look streamlined and chic, and a pop of color can brighten
    up your day. Beat the winter doldrums by trying out this fun outfit
    combination.[12]![](Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Wear a knit hat. A knit hat, or beanie, will keep you warm and give
    you a cool, off-duty vibe.[13] The best part? You don't need to
    worry about bad hair
    days!![](Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_14_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Casually_in_Winter_Step_14_Version_2.jpg")

## TIPS

-   Layering is the key to winter dressing. Whether you're outside in a
    snowstorm or inside a heated classroom or office, you can peel off
    or add layers to stay comfortable.
-   Consulting street style blogs can be a great way to see trends and
    get outfit inspiration from people in your city.
-   You can buy waterproof spray to extend the life of your favorite
    winter boots.
