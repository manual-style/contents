Some pregnant women enjoy the glow and swell of their bodies and others
report feeling fat, tired and similar to a science experiment. One of
the biggest adjustments for a pregnant woman is wearing maternity
clothes instead of her favorite jeans or that perfect little black
dress. It can be hard to feel chic and fashion forward when your body is
changing and nothing seems to fit. If you have a formal event to attend,
the options can seem even more limited. Dress chic in maternity formal
wear by checking out what is in style, shopping at the right retailers,
and adding your own creativity to your outfit with the right shoes,
dazzling accessories or perfect hairstyle.

## Steps

### Defining "Chic"

1.  Keep up on the latest formal wear
    fashions.![](Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Read your favorite fashion magazines and keep up with designers
        who specialize in formal wear. This will give you an idea of
        what people are wearing, such as whether ball gowns or cocktail
        dresses are popular and what colors are the hottest for any
        season or year.
2.  Consider what looks good on you. You know your own style better than
    anyone. The same colors and styles will look good on your when you
    are
    pregnant.![](Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Take a hint from pregnant celebrities. Hollywood gets obsessed when
    someone from the A-list is expecting. Pay attention to what those
    women are wearing to premieres, award ceremonies and other formal
    events.![](Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")

### Shopping for Chic Maternity Formal Wear

1.  Start with major maternity retailers. Browse the formal wear sold
    online and in stores at places such as Motherhood Maternity, Due
    Maternity, A Pea in the Pod and others. Most stores will have a
    section on evening or formal
    wear.![](Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Compare what you find to what you have defined as "chic." See if
        any designs resemble formal wear you have seen in magazines and
        on celebrities.
2.  Try second hand or thrift stores. Women are often eager to sell or
    donate their maternity clothing. You might find a chic find at a
    consignment shop or even your local
    Goodwill.![](Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Shop outside of maternity
    sizes.![](Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Buy something in a department store or a chic boutique that is a
        couple of sizes larger than your non-pregnant size. Have it
        fitted in the areas that it is still too big. For example, when
        you buy a size that fits your belly, you might need to have the
        sleeves shortened.
4.  Look for something chic that you will still be able to wear when you
    are not pregnant. Try a simple black dress in a stretchy
    fabric.![](Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Have something custom made. If you have the budget to splurge on
    your formal wear, ask a seamstress to make you the chic dress you
    want.![](Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Shop in a friend's closet. If you know someone close to your own
    size who has recently been pregnant, ask if she has any formal wear
    that you can try on and
    borrow.![](Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")

### Making your Maternity Formal Wear Chic

1.  Accessorize your outfit. Accessories come in a single size, and they
    fit you when you are pregnant
    too.![](Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Dress up your attire with chic accessories such as elegant
        pearls, dramatic diamonds or other pieces of jewelry that can
        accent your neck, ears and wrists.
2.  Choose comfortable shoes. Some women experience swelling in their
    feet and ankles during pregnancy. Comfortable flats or supportive
    wedge heels can be just as chic as
    stilettos.![](Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Choose a wrap. Instead of trying to fit into a coat, keep a pretty
    shawl or pashmina around your arms if your formal event is outdoors
    or in cooler
    weather.![](Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Take extra time with your hair and
    makeup.![](Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Chic_in_Maternity_Formal_Wear_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Accentuate your chic style with a dramatic up do or a stylish
        short cut.
    -   Have your hair, makeup and nails done in a professional salon if
        you can afford it. The little bit of luxury will take the
        pressure off you, and leave you feeling chic and fashionable.

## Tips

-   Check websites if you are having a problem finding the right size in
    maternity formal wear. Women who are plus-sized or petite often find
    themselves out of luck when they go shopping. Many shops will have a
    larger selection of sizes online.
-   To get more bang for you buck, watch for transitional items, items
    that can be worn during and after pregnancy (many of which
    incorporate nursing options.)
-   Get your formal wear as close to the date of the event as possible.
    If you buy something to wear in your first trimester, it will likely
    not fit you if you are wearing it several months later.
