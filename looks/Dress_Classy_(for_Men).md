People really do notice when a man knows how to dress nicely. Knowing
what to wear, how to get the colors accurate and how to keep your
clothes in good condition are all important elements of dressing with
class. For every man who desires to dress in a classy way, the following
suggestions will help you to succeed.

## Steps

### Choosing dressy clothing

1.  Choose crisp, cool and well-fitted clothing. Wearing the same old
    expensive suit for all occasions will never help. A cool pair of
    denim jeans with a lightly colored, well-fitting shirt followed by a
    lightly colored pair of Converse shoes will do the magic. This
    combination is affordable and decent. That said, none can say that a
    well-fitted Raymond suit is not cool. That's the best a man can get
    but it's not the only
    option.![](Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Have clean footwear for almost anywhere you go. Attracting the
    opposite sex has been the main concern for men while standing in
    front of the dresser. However, almost every time its forgotten how
    much a stylish pair of sneakers helps to get anyone's eye on one.
    Mostly girls love guys wearing a good pair of
    shoes.[1]![](Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_2.jpg")
3.  While choosing a suitable color, keep your skin tone in mind. For
    every skin tone there is a measure of permitted colors which will
    bring out the best of your look. However, bear in mind that there
    are limits; for example, a neon colored high-necked T with pink
    shorts can never be attractive, no matter what skin tone you have.
    Always choose decent colors. A lemon colored shirt with a white pair
    of skinny trousers can be a good
    option.[2]![](Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Avoid shorts. Yeah guys, they are never cool unless you are in the
    pool or gym. Don't wear them home after exercising
    either!![](Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Choose the right items for your wardrobe. Even though dressing in a
    classy way never depends on the number or type of items your
    wardrobe possesses, it is still the case that having some standard,
    quality basics will always make it easy for you to dress with class.
    This list offers some suggestions for clothing items that the classy
    guy would do well to have in his
    wardrobe:[3]![](Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_5.jpg")
    -   A pair(s) of clean, well-fitted jeans
    -   At least one good quality suit
    -   One or two ties (neither too fat nor too thin)
    -   Both dark and lightly colored shirts
    -   Trousers in decent colors
    -   Round neck and polo T-shirts
    -   A pair of good quality sneakers and a decent pair of party
        shoes.
6.  Add good accessories. Watches, shades, etc. do not necessarily need
    to be expensive but they must be decent and able to reflect a mature
    taste. Ask your girlfriend or elder sister to help you to
    choose.[4]![](Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_6.jpg")

### Taking care of yourself

1.  Smell good. Do not forget to apply cologne, deodorant,
    antiperspirant or anything else that will help you to smell good.
    That's the icing on the cake. Even an alpha male with body odor will
    be found repellent to those with sensitive
    noses.[5]![](Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_7.jpg")
2.  Take good care of yourself so that you have a good body. Not
    necessarily a muscly one like Schwarzenegger but by adding some lean
    muscles, you will look good in almost everything. Hit the gym once
    or twice a week to keep it
    clean.[6]![](Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_8.jpg")

### Taking good care of your clothing

1.  Take proper care of your clothes and everything that's inside your
    dresser. Always remember that clean garments are the best option.
    Even an expensive shirt with a line of dirt around the cuff will
    kill the impression instantly. Always keep your clothes clean and
    tidy. The following suggestions might be a
    help:[7]![](Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_(for_Men)_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Keep everything arranged neatly in a dresser or wardrobe.
    -   Keep untidy clothes aside, perhaps in a laundry bag or basket.
    -   Make sections for pants, shirts, blazers and under garments.
    -   Clean your clothes yourself, as you know which parts need more
        cleaning.
    -   Keep all of your clean clothes pressed.

## Tips

-   Remember to ask a female for advice. But she must be of either the
    same-age or older than you.
-   Never forget about deodorant. Otherwise you will kill the classiness
    from the beginning.
-   No matter how much you try, personal hygiene should never be
    compromised. Take a shower regularly and brush your teeth at least
    twice a day.
-   Keep your footwear clean.
