Dressing classy doesn’t mean that you have to wear formal clothing. You
can incorporate classy elements into your everyday look. No matter what
your personal style is, look for well-fitting, quality clothing. Mix
dressy and casual styles to assemble a composed but laid-back look. The
right accessories can tie together the outfit.

## Steps

### Choosing the Right Clothing

1.  [Choose clothes that fit your body
    well](Buy_Clothes_That_Fit "wikilink"). Well-fitting clothing will
    naturally make you look more stylish and put-together. Make sure
    that the clothing isn’t too tight or loose in certain areas of your
    body. Knowing your body type can help you [pick styles and cuts that
    fit your body](Dress_for_Your_Body_Type "wikilink")
    comfortably.[1]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you have clothing that is too large or long in some areas,
        you can pay a tailor to take it in. Tailored clothing can make
        your outfit look like it was made for you.
    -   Always try clothes on before buying them. If you order your
        clothing online, make sure to try the outfit on before you wear
        it out.
2.  [Buy well-made and high-quality
    clothing](Spot_High_Quality_Clothing "wikilink"). Well-made clothing
    will usually fit your body and appear more elegant than cheaply made
    styles. When you buy the clothing, check for any loose stitches or
    stains.[2]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Well-made clothing often costs more, but you can also shop at
        thrift stores, vintage stores, and online secondhand fashion
        sites to find less expensive quality clothing.
3.  Select pieces made out of high-quality fabrics. The tag on the
    clothing will tell you what it is made out of. Choose fabrics that
    are meant to last, such as cotton, wool, leather, linen, and silk.
    Avoid synthetic fabrics like polyester or
    rayon.[3]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Look for timeless clothing that won’t fall out of fashion. Classy
    clothing tends to include styles that last for generations. While
    you can still wear trendy styles, make sure you have plenty of
    basics in your wardrobe as well. Some great, classic styles
    include:[4]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Slacks and skirts
    -   Collared shirts like polos, oxford shirts, and dress shirts
    -   A-line dresses
    -   Blazers
    -   Jeans
    -   Cardigans and pullover sweaters
    -   Prints like horizontal stripes, gingham, paisley, plaid, and
        argyle
5.  Choose neutral colors that you can mix and match. Neutrals are
    colors that go with just about anything. They include black, white,
    brown, khaki, and navy blue. Neutral colors can help your casual
    wardrobe appear polished and timeless. They will help you create
    many different outfits while still remaining laid-back and
    casual.[5]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
6.  Go for sweaters and cardigans instead of hoodies and sweatshirts.
    While hoodies and sweatshirts have their place, they are generally
    not as classy as a nice pullover or button-up sweater. A nice,
    well-fitting sweater can dress up any casual
    clothing.[6]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Cardigans are a great option to wear over a-line dresses, a
        shirt and tie, or a pair of khaki trousers.
    -   Pullover sweaters look very classy when worn over a collared
        shirt.
    -   Other classy options for outerwear include leather jackets,
        crewneck or V-neck sweaters, sweater vests, pea coats, and
        blazers.
7.  Choose dark washes of jeans over light washes. Faded or light wash
    jeans may appear more worn than dark wash jeans. You can get denim
    in dark blue, black, or other dark neutral
    shades.[7]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Avoid ripped, deconstructed, or worn clothing. The trick to looking
    casual and classy is to make sure that your clothing appears clean,
    unwrinkled, and in good condition. While ripped or deconstructed
    styles may be trendy, they may not be the classiest option for
    casual wear.

### Creating Classy and Casual Outfits

1.  Dress up a pair of jeans with a nice top. Jeans are versatile pieces
    of clothing. They can be casual or dressy depending on what you pair
    them with. Wearing a well-fitting pair of jeans with a button-up
    shirt or printed blouse is perfect for almost any
    occasion.[8]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Great casual shirts to wear with jeans include flannel
        button-ups, henley shirts, breton tops, and peasant shirts.
    -   You can look classy in a t-shirt and jeans as long as the shirt
        is well-fitting, clean, and unwrinkled. Look for t-shirts with
        simple designs instead of logos or brands.
2.  Put on neutral slacks with a dress shirt for a business casual look.
    Business casual usually requires a relaxed professional outfit. The
    go-to outfit is typically a pair of slacks in a neutral color, such
    as khaki, navy blue, or black. This is worn with a nice dress shirt.
    If you want, add a cardigan or blazer on
    top.[9]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Examples of a nice dress shirt include collared button-up
        shirts, crewnecks, ruffled blouses, cashmere sweaters, and
        vests.
    -   Women can also wear skirts or modest dresses.
    -   Ties are typically optional for business casual, but they will
        help add an extra classy edge to your outfit.
    -   Alternatively you can try to [dress up a
        shirt](Dress_Up_a_Shirt "wikilink") that is a little too much on
        the casual side.
3.  Wear modest shorts and a t-shirt for a summer look. If it is hot
    outside, you can still rock the classy but casual look. Shorts
    should reach at least your mid-thigh. T-shirts or tank tops, on the
    other hand, should fit slightly loose without being too
    low-cut.[10]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Colorful shorts are a great way to add a bit of summer flair to
        your outfit. Try salmon, aqua blue, red, or olive green shorts.
    -   Classy shirts that go well with shorts include polos, linen
        shirts, and v-neck tees.
4.  Layer a coat over a well-fitting sweater and shirt when it is cold.
    Layers keep you warm in the winter. Wear a thin undershirt or
    long-sleeved shirt. Pull a nice-looking sweater over it. When you go
    out, make sure you have a heavy coat on
    top.[11]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Nice sweaters to wear casually include crew neck sweaters,
        v-necks, zip necks, and cowl sweaters. These go well with
        long-sleeved shirts, flannels, turtlenecks, collared button-ups,
        or roll neck shirts.
    -   If you wear a dress or skirt out, layer a sweater or blazer on
        top. Wear tights underneath to keep warm. Wear a long coat, such
        as a trench coat or overcoat, on top.
    -   If you wear slacks or pants, choose a shorter coat, such as a
        peacoat, sports coat, or duffle coat.

### Accessorizing Your Outfit

1.  Pick a nice pair of clean shoes to match the outfit. Shoes can help
    complete an outfit. Whether you wear sneakers, sandals, or flats,
    choose a pair that is clean and well-cared for. Some options for
    classy and casual shoes include canvas sneakers, leather loafers,
    leather hiking boots, ankle boots, or ballet
    flats.[12]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Generally, you want the color of your shoes to be the same color
        or a shade darker than your outfit.
    -   You can also use shoes to add a pop of color to your outfit.
        Bright red and yellow shoes work well when paired with neutral
        colors like navy or black.
    -   Brown, navy, black, and white shoes go with almost any outfit.
2.  Use scarves, ties, and belts to add pops of color to your outfit.
    Look for bold prints and colors to spice up your neutral wardrobe.
    [Match your accessories](Accessorize "wikilink") carefully to the
    outfit that you are wearing to make your classy casual look
    complete.[13]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_14_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_14_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Wear one piece of statement jewelry at a time. Statement jewelry can
    appear classy, but too much may be flashy. If you decide to wear
    statement jewelry, try to only wear 1 piece at any time. For
    example, if you wear a bold cocktail ring, don’t pair it with a
    blingy necklace, heavy dangling earrings, or a flashy
    bracelet.[14]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_15_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_15_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Carry a nice purse or satchel with you. A quality and
    well-constructed purse, briefcase, or satchel can help you carry
    your belongings while still looking nice. Check out designer bags
    for well-made, timeless pieces. You can also search online for
    secondhand designer bags or hunt around for cheaper but still
    quality pieces at
    malls.[15]![](Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_16_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Classy_but_Casual_Step_16_Version_2.jpg")
