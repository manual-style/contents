Creepy isn't universal defined. What one person thinks is creepy,
someone else will consider perfectly normal. This article may help you
dress creepily in the opinion of some and attempts to provide
suggestions and guidance that can apply every day. Read on from step
number one below.

## Steps

1.  Choose what you want to resemble, creepily. You may want to look
    like a vampire, a discharged mental asylum patient, a scary clown,
    your own evil twin, a teenager who lives forever in the past and
    dwells on everything negative that has ever happened and blames that
    for their current circumstances, or anything else you think is
    creepy.![](Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Dress creepily like your chosen character. If you want to [look like
    a vampire](Look_Like_a_Vampire "wikilink"), wear black and
    [Victorian style
    clothing](Be_Similar_to_a_Girl_from_the_Victorian_Era "wikilink").
    Black is always good to wear since it makes you look pale and it is
    quite depressing so you will always look like you have just attended
    a
    funeral.![](Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Wear the appropriate makeup. Make up is very important for both boys
    and girls, white face powder helps make you look like a ghost and
    using a brown eye shadow around your eyes makes you look sleep
    deprived, creepy, and ill. If you want to look slightly dead, also
    cover your lips with white powder, this will make you look drained
    of
    blood.![](Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Dress in the same style and act strangely around people. This will
    creep them out even
    more.![](Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Dye your hair a dark colour. The preferred option is black since
    this can make you look even paler and
    creepy.![](Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Smile or laugh rarely. Always stare at people with a creepy gaze so
    they feel
    uncomfortable.![](Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
7.  Try to have inspiration for your style to help get new ideas. e.g
    the Addams family, Interview with the
    Vampire.![](Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
8.  If you dress like this on a daily basis, people will find you creepy
    and [mysterious](Be_Mysterious "wikilink"). Donâ€™t expect people to
    respond all the
    same.![](Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Creepily_Every_Day_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
