When it comes to dressing cute, there is not a one-size-fits-all
formula. Style is an extension and expression of an individual’s
personal aesthetic. As you discover what it means for you to dress cute,
consider purchasing clothes that complement your figure. Gradually
refine and update your wardrobe with basics and special pieces that
capture your personality and unique style. Complete your cute looks with
accessories that express your creativity.

## Steps

### Dressing for Your Body Type

1.  Accentuate your hourglass figure. If you have an hourglass figure,
    your voluptuous curves contrast with your tiny waist. The key to
    dressing cute is to accumulate a wardrobe that highlights your
    figure, not hides it. Consider purchasing the following pieces to
    complement your
    curves:![](Dress_to_Flatter_a_Curvier_Figure_Step_23.jpg "fig:Dress_to_Flatter_a_Curvier_Figure_Step_23.jpg")
    -   Belted jackets
    -   Crop tops
    -   Pencil Skirts
    -   Wrap dresses
    -   Wide-legged pants with a belted waist[1]
2.  Complement your apple shape. If you carry weight around the
    midsection and have a slim lower body, your body is apple shaped.
    The key to dressing cute is to wear clothing that emphasizes your
    slim legs and narrow shoulders, thus minimizing your midsections.
    Consider adding the following pieces to your
    wardrobe:![](Dress_an_Apple_Shape_Body_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_an_Apple_Shape_Body_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Swing jackets
    -   Flowy peasant tops
    -   High-waisted circle skirts
    -   Shift dresses
    -   Low-waisted straight-legged pants[2]
3.  Accentuate your pear shape. If your body is pear shaped, the widest
    part of your figure is around your hips. The key to dressing cute
    and flattering your shape is to accentuate your torso in an effort
    to elongate and balance your figure. Consider adding the following
    essentials to your
    closest:![](Dress_if_You've_Got_a_Pear_Shaped_Figure_Step_17_Version_5.jpg "fig:Dress_if_You've_Got_a_Pear_Shaped_Figure_Step_17_Version_5.jpg")
    -   Structured jackets
    -   Embellished tops
    -   A-line skirts
    -   Fit-and-flare dresses
    -   Boot-cut pants[3]
4.  Complement your banana shape. If you are banana shaped, you carry
    weight around your midsection while maintaining a slim lower and
    upper body. The key to flattering your figure and dressing cute is
    to don garments that create the illusion that your hips and bust are
    proportional to the rest of your body. This is accomplished by
    highlight the narrowest part of your waist. Consider filling your
    closet with the following
    pieces:![](Dress_as_a_Petite_Woman_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_as_a_Petite_Woman_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Cropped jackets with a banded bottom
    -   Ruffled tops
    -   Mini skirts
    -   Dresses with side cut-outs
    -   Tapered pants[4]

### Refining, Updating, and Rocking Your Wardrobe

1.  Purchase the basics. Wardrobe staples, such as the little black
    dress, are classic, timeless, and never go out of style. The basics
    provide you with a chic canvas on which to accessorize. You can
    dress them up or dress them down. As you accumulate your cute,
    basics wardrobe, consider purchasing the following items in styles
    that complement your
    figure:![](Get_a_Basic_Wardrobe_(for_Girls)_Step_2.jpg "fig:Get_a_Basic_Wardrobe_(for_Girls)_Step_2.jpg")
    -   Little black dress
    -   White button-up shirt
    -   Pencil skirt
    -   Tailored trousers
    -   Shift dresses
    -   Jeans
    -   Trench Coat
    -   Cashmere sweaters
    -   Invest in high-quality basics.[5]
2.  Skip the trends. Trendy does not always translate into cute. Instead
    of attempting to keep up with the never-ending cycle of fashion
    trends, be selective when it comes to purchasing this season’s
    runway inspired looks. If a trend complements your figure, embrace
    it; if a trend highlights the parts of your body you wish to
    minimize, skip
    it.![](Look_Older_As_a_Teen_Step_1_Version_4.jpg "fig:Look_Older_As_a_Teen_Step_1_Version_4.jpg")[6]
3.  Asses your current clothes and new purchases. A well curated,
    versatile wardrobe of eclectic pieces, trendy clothes, and timeless
    garments will supply you with an endless combination of cute
    outfits. To amass such a collection, you must assess your current
    collection of clothing, selectively shop for new items, and splurge
    on occasion.
    ![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   As you plan ahead for the next season, take a moment to examine
        your closet. Remove the pieces you can omit from your
        collection. Make a list of the pieces you need to replace and
        pieces that are missing from your wardrobe.
    -   Make a shopping plan and stick to it.
    -   Instead of making superfluous purchases, spend your money on
        high quality items that you can dress up, dress down, and easily
        incorporate into your wardrobe.[7]
4.  Wear your clothes with confidence. Your sense of style is a
    reflection of your personality, experiences, and opinions. Don't
    apologize for your look—be proud of your fashion choices and wear
    your clothes with confidence. When you combine hot trends with
    classic styles and colors that accentuate your features, you will
    always look
    cute.![](Dress_to_Flatter_a_Curvier_Figure_Step_21.jpg "fig:Dress_to_Flatter_a_Curvier_Figure_Step_21.jpg")[8]

### Accessorizing Your Outfits

1.  Let your personality shine. A positive, unique, and genuine
    personality is always in vogue. While your clothing and accessories
    reflect your personality, your personality does not consist solely
    of these material items. Rather, your words, actions, opinions,
    experiences, and environment combine to form your identity. Discover
    and express your true self in a cute outfit that you can rock with
    confidence.![](Dress_to_Flatter_a_Curvier_Figure_Step_27.jpg "fig:Dress_to_Flatter_a_Curvier_Figure_Step_27.jpg")[9]
2.  Enhance your look with cute jewelry. The right jewelry can instantly
    elevate your look from drab to adorable. Invest in high-quality
    necklaces, earrings, bracelets that complement your wardrobe.
    Mix-and-match classic pieces with trendy jewelry to add pizzaz to
    your cute
    outfits.![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Wear a necklace to add interest to an open neckline.
    -   Stack bangles and bracelets on your wrists.
    -   Wear a fashionable watch instead of a cuff.
    -   Put on a pair of statement earrings and keep the rest of your
        jewelry to a minimum.[10]
3.  Complement your look with a cute purse. Your accessories are a
    representation of your taste, personality, and creativity. Invest in
    a variety of purses, such as totes, cross-body bags, clutches, and
    backpacks, that represent your individual
    aesthetic.![](Be_Girly_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Girly_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")[11]
    When you pair a purse with an outfit, consider if it complements
    your look, is appropriate for the occasion, and is an extension of
    your personal style.
4.  Complete your look with the perfect pair of shoes. Shoes are more
    than an accessory; they are a fashion statement. While you should
    consider your shoe choices carefully, don’t be afraid to elevate the
    cuteness of your outfit by taking a shoe risk. You may choose to
    select a pair of shoes that perfectly matches your outfit or opt to
    wear the wrong pair. For example, you could wear elegant black pumps
    with your little black dress or a trendy pair of fashion
    sneakers.![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")[12]

        custom cute look with a few additional accessories.
    -   A fabulous pair of sunglasses complements every look.[13]

        of color to you look.
