Have you ever seen some of those weird people that dress like a little
kid? This article tells you how to look cute, without looking overdone.
It will give you tips about everything from hair, to make up, to
clothing. Hope you like it!!!

## Steps

1.  Put on make up. Make sure it's not too much. A light coating of
    mascara, foundation, and lip gloss should do the trick! If you're
    tan, peach lip gloss looks the best. If you're pale, either go with
    light pink for the day, and red for the night. Try not to overdo it.
    If you want to put on some blush, do it with
    caution.![](Dress_Cute_Without_Looking_Overdone_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Cute_Without_Looking_Overdone_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Do your hair. Straightening your hair is what everyone is doing.
    However, if your hair is naturally curly, please don't ruin it by
    trying to make it look like something it really isn't! For a
    nighttime look, curling your hair on the ends looks completely
    amazing! Make sure to use heat protection for both
    looks.![](Dress_Cute_Without_Looking_Overdone_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Cute_Without_Looking_Overdone_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Get accessories that reflect your personality. There are MANY
    different ways to look totally adorable that can reflect your own
    personal style. Here are some items to buy when shopping at an
    accessory store: Ribbons, one big bow, hair clips, silver jewelry,
    locket necklaces, and etc. Don't try to be someone you're not
    though.![](Dress_Cute_Without_Looking_Overdone_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Cute_Without_Looking_Overdone_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Smell nice! Victoria's Secret has amazing perfumes and body lotions.
    Get more of the younger, fruitier types. If you can't afford it
    (they're usually really expensive) then try some less expensive
    perfumes at stores like Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle,
    Hollister, and PacSun. If that's too expensive then you can buy
    amazing fragrances and lotions even at your local grocery store.
    Using nice shampoos and conditioners is key too. Get the ones that
    smell nice and work well! If you don't want to use perfume, try
    using scented
    deodorant!![](Dress_Cute_Without_Looking_Overdone_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Cute_Without_Looking_Overdone_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Get a few new shirts! Getting new clothes makes you feel happier and
    look better. Lighter, sweeter tones like light blue, pink, white,
    tend to make you look sweet. Black and hot pink also look cute, if
    your more of a rocker. If you're in between, any dark blues, greens,
    etc. will work fine too. Brand names are big right now, so if you
    like those stores, hit up the malls! Save up your money and stick to
    an affordable
    budget!![](Dress_Cute_Without_Looking_Overdone_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Cute_Without_Looking_Overdone_Step_5.jpg")

## Warnings

-   Be hygienic! No one likes a girl who smells like locker rooms.
-   Make sure you don't put on too much eyeliner. For some people,
    eyeliner looks better than it does on others. If you have thick
    eyelashes, it tends to look overdone sometimes. Be extra careful!
    Either apply it to the top of your lid, or the water line or both.
    Most of the time, putting heavy layers makes you look un-classy!
-   DO NOT overdo the bows! Yes, they are cute. However, if you put a
    huge one on the side of your head, it may make you look like a
    five-year-old. Be modest when it comes to choosing bows and ribbons.
