If you're torn between looking stylish and being comfy, follow these
steps to glamour.

## Steps

1.  The next time you get a haircut, ask for a low maintenance cut. Such
    a haircut saves time, because your hair looks good just by brushing
    it. Try leaving your hair down, but if it's too hot or your hair
    just isn't cooperating, then getting a messy bun, loose ponytails or
    braids is a good
    idea.![](Dress_Cute_but_Comfy_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Cute_but_Comfy_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Don't put too much makeup on. It takes forever, and it's not good
    for your
    skin.![](Dress_Cute_but_Comfy_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Cute_but_Comfy_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Don't wear any clothes that feel uncomfortable. Try wearing
    semi-fitted T-shirts, hoodies, cardigans, jeans, cargo pants, and
    sneakers. Avoid anything tight, itchy, or hard to move in. And
    lastly, avoid high heels like the plague; it's hard to walk in them,
    but it's okay to wear them once in a while if you already have some
    or like heels. Your feet need some type of arch, or they'll start
    hurting with totally flat
    feet.![](Dress_Cute_but_Comfy_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Cute_but_Comfy_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Avoid jewelry that pinches or is too heavy. Scarves are awesome,
    since you can wear them as a headband, a belt, a wrap, or a scarf.
    And if you canâ€™t live without a headband then stick to stretchy
    fabric ones because unlike the metal or plastic ones, they don't
    give you a headache after few hours of wearing
    them.![](Dress_Cute_but_Comfy_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Cute_but_Comfy_Step_4.jpg")
