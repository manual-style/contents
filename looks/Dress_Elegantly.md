expensive piece. There are the style or rules that you have to follow.

part by dressing well and being well kept but none of that actually
matter if you don't behave in a classy way. The key to dressing
elegantly is to carry yourself with confidence and grace, being polite
to others, being kind and respectful.

    body and expressions. Trim your finger nails and toe nails and keep
    them clean regularly.
2.  Take care of your hair. Whether tied or let loose, always maintain a
    routine for hair care. Oil them and shampoo every week, twice a week
    as you have time. If your hair falls a lot, comb before stepping
    outside. You can braid them or tie a bun instead of keeping them
    open.

    linen Kashmir but they will be more expensive but generally they
    will last a lot

    justifies your thoughts, to some extent. Wearing traditional clothes
    for traditional events and wearing casuals on casual days looks mkre
    appropriate than choosing any combination randomly.

    inch long heel will only straighten your posture while standing or
    walking.

    or too tight to be confortable. They'll look better and you will
    feel better. Embrace tailoring and find a great tailor or seamstress
    because you will be amazed at the difference it can make just by
    altering little
    details.![](Dressing_well_of_good_manner.jpg "fig:Dressing_well_of_good_manner.jpg")
2.  Avoid drooping shoulders. Shoulders when in the right place, can
    affect your overall look. Have them just right especially in formal
    shirts and fitted blouse. Also make sure that they are not too above
    the shoulder line either.
    -   Some shirts are designed in a loose fitting style. Make the most
        of those patterns and enjoy the look.
3.  Maintain proper length at the hem. Wearing pants, long skirts,
    formal or informal dresses need that you maintain its length right.
    Don't just fold the pants if it is extra long. Have them tailored
    right where it should be. Different attires have different sizes
    that they follow.
4.  Avoid extremely tight tops. To dress elegantly, you might want to
    avoid tops especially casual wear that is worn for comfort to be too
    tight to breath. Make sure that there is enough room about two
    inches) on the sides for you to comfortably breath and stretch while
    doing regular activities.
5.  Alter your clothes. To have your clothes flatter your figure, biceps
    or waistline, measure your self completely, know your body type and
    alter your clothes just as needed to go with your body type and
    needs.

### Choosing the Right Fabric and Color

1.  Choose the right fabric. Based on your daily life and requirement,
    choose the fabric that might go with it. Buy high quality cotton for
    formal pants. You can carry whatever you are wearing, elegantly if
    you feel good and are comfortable. For that, choose fabrics that
    allow breathing and is easy on your skin.
2.  Wear light when it is hot outside. Light colors keep you cooler as
    compared to darker ones during summer. So, opt for lighter colors
    that you like. Play with darker print if you miss something dark.
3.  Wear the colors that look good on you. Some look good with two toned
    fabrics. See what justifies your strong features and qualities and
    have a wardrobe keeping that in mind. Some don't like certain colors
    not knowing if those colors might justify their personality instead.
    Give them a try to be sure before you make a choice.
4.  Choose printed fabric. Large prints can be tricky to carry,
    especially on formal events. Smaller prints, borders, bands can all
    make an outfit stand out and be okay to be worn on both formal and
    casual events.

### Buying More Elegant Items

1.  Buying plain clothing. Plain shirts and jackets for girls almost
    always looks elegant.
2.  Put together a formal dress. Opt for single colored formal dresses
    like a navy blue or pastel pink. Use a thin belt in a contrasting
    color like a white on a navy dress.

### Knowing What Not to Do

1.  Avoid fashion that is uncomfortable to carry. If you aren't as
    comfortable to talk wearing heels, opt for flat, loafers, moccasins,
    boots, etc. You can't be elegant if you are dwindling or are
    constantly cautious of how you carry yourself.
2.  Avoid too much shine. When you have to be heavily dressed, opt for
    deep, dark tones in makeup and clothing. However, avoid dark red or
    maroon glossy lipsticks
3.  Avoid glossy mascara. Soft looking makeup and clothing is more
    elegant than dark, contrasting, glossy, colors and textures all at
    once. Also, using eyeliners on the lower eyelids can be too heavy to
    be elegant.
4.  Use gloss where you can. A good nail polish that is perfectly
    painted on well shaped long or short nails can satisfy one's desire
    to go heavy on colors. You can use almost any color.
    -   Wear an elegant hair accesory fitting the occasion.
    -   Just avoid prints or patterns on nails that look like a riot of
        colors.

### Looking Elegant with the Plus Size

1.  Don't squeeze yourself into something nice. For instance a slender
    looking shirt peaks your interest while your body type is more
    fuller, skip the slender option. Instead, use your bodily features
    to your advantage that slender bodied people might find difficult.
    Try longer tunics that may seem heavy on a slimmer body. Try shirts
    with a pattern like a pinup or a tie up like design on the sides.
    Wear sheer fabric to look gentle. A sheer sleeve or a little
    transparency at the hem brings out a more elegant look.
2.  Wear the right size undergarments. It will make a huge difference if
    you feel good inside. Buying the right size, not too small or large,
    even if it means spending more on it than an outfit, can make be
    worthwhile. Nice stretchable fabric that holds the body well as you
    walk or sit is treasurable. To create a good wardrobe of inner wear
    that is right for you. Any outfit will feel right if you know your
    inside is taken care of.
3.  Use stripes. Stripes are classy, elegant and evergreen. They make a
    body type look slender, curvy, slim, taught, short anything you
    like. Choosing the right pattern where the lines draw away attention
    where you want could do wonders.
4.  Avoid fuller looking pants. To make pants comfortable, opt for
    stretchable fabrics and waistline that you like. You can choose a
    midwaist if that's your style or go low waist to keep your tummy
    easy. Avoid jeans that are not stretchable if you can't maintain a
    good posture.
5.  Use an accessory. A right scarf around the neck, can dtaw away
    attention from your weight and make a good difference to your
    personality. Adding a jacket can do the same. Make sure the shirt
    inside is the perfect fit for you.
