Into metal music but don't know how to dress? Here is the guide for you.

## Steps

1.  Wear a suitable pair of pants. A good choice is to try Black/Blue
    Jeans/ Ripped Pants, Camo pants. Always avoid shaggy pants. Baggy
    for Nu Metal normal for most other styles.Must wear black, brown or
    any dark color
    pants.![](Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Wear metal band shirts baggier for a nu metal style. Denim and
    leather coats for Thrash Metal and most other forms of metal ripped
    sleeves are good. Flannel shirts are good. Also radium T-Shirts are
    very
    popular.![](Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Wear a studded belt with a big and handy buckle, always. Numerous
    belt buckles are popular like metal skulls
    etc.![](Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Wear studded wrist bands and leather jacket. These are the iconic
    sign that you are a true metalhead. Also cool looking
    belts![](Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Collect different types of chain and wear them with your belt and
    pants.![](Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Style your hair appropriately. Almost every heavy metal star has
    long hair, so if you're comfortable with growing yours out, do it.
    If not, boys can also shave their hair (think Phil Labonte, Phil
    Anselmo, Bruce Dickinson, Kerry King, among
    others.)![](Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_6.jpg")
    -   Some places prefer you to tie your hair back, so tie it back,
        but be inventive, use a bandana without a bobble for a Guns 'n'
        Roses look, or a bandanna with a bobble for a biker look.
7.  Try growing a beard or
    goatee.![](Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Wear Army Boots or white high-tops for an old-school look. For punk
    look, wear
    sneakers.![](Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_8.jpg")
9.  **BONUS:** Drink beer! (Only if you are old enough
    to!)![](Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Heavy_Metal_Style_Step_9.jpg")

## Tips

-   Don't be metal to be cool, be metal 'cause you like the music.
-   Metal fashion can be restrictive or comfortable, extreme or
    laid-back. Sync up your feelings and your style and you'll find that
    it ebbs and flows. This is good! Metal it up or chill out depending
    on how you feel.
-   Don't care about what others think of you.
-   Thrift stores, army/navy surplus stores, and flea markets are your
    friends; you'll find used clothing for relatively cheap prices.
-   If you are feeling really Heavy Metal when you get out of the shower
    do the wet hair headbanging thing it can get you really
    energetic,worked up, and you'll have a lot of fun doing it (medium
    to long hair is recommended for guys)
-   Value yourself, value your judgement: wear what works for you, and
    even more importantly, what you like. It doesn't matter if you're
    taking inspiration from Tony Kakko from Sonata Arctica or Dead from
    Mayhem: take the style and make it your own.
-   It helps to know what they are saying (if you are fairly new to
    metal music or just don't get it just look up the lyrics it will
    make it much easier to sing and you will look like less of an idiot)
-   Don't push things, just go with the flow. Take years to do this, and
    create your own style.
-   Never buy pre-ripped stuff.
-   Use a cheese grater to make jeans look faded.
-   On Denim jackets place patches of your favorite bands.
-   Being Nu Metal isn't liked among most of the metal community.

## Warnings

-   Be ready to defend your music.
-   Heavy Metal is an unusual genre of music. Thankfully, Heavy Metal is
    about the music, not the fashion or the scene. Remember this!
-   Depending on your crowd, be careful of being considered an 'image
    metalhead': one who values the fashion aspect of the metal scene too
    much compared to the music.
-   Your parents may have something to say about your new found musical
    tastes. If this occurs, remind them that you are your own person,
    and that Heavy Metal can be beautiful as well as savage. (See, Iced
    Earth, Candlemass, Blind Guardian)
-   Be careful in the moshes.
-   Lyrics in Metal song may be profane so if you are easily offended
    don't listen.
-   Look out for metal elitist, there are always some metalheads who
    think they're better and 'more metal' than you, who consider you a
    poser. But most of the time they're just a bunch of posers who don't
    understand metal.
-   You will be made fun of by many people.

## Things You'll Need

-   Access to music
-   Being Open Minded
-   Having good self-esteem helps
-   Choice of true fashion wear
-   Intelligence, while not being a must, is very helpful.
