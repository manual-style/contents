Finding the perfect balance between menswear and womenswear can be
challenging in the fashion world. The 'Lesbian Chic' look will allow one
to combine both looks into a classy, metrosexual style

## Steps

1.  Stock up on blazers, skinny or straight-leg jeans, chino shorts,
    cardigans, crew-neck sweaters, button-downs, polos, t-shirts, and
    tank tops. Stripes add flavor to an otherwise solid-color outfit.
    Small polka dots are okay as well, in
    moderation.[1]![](Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Layer! Wear button-downs under sweaters or blazers and cuff the
    sleeves. Put a blazer or cardigan over a t-shirt or tank-top.
    Experiment with layering and see what works for
    you.[2]![](Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Belts can come in handy when tying an outfit together. Make sure to
    own at least one brown and one black leather (or faux leather)
    belt.![](Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Wear sports bras on a regular basis, unless you prefer regular bras
    or a regular bra is absolutely necessary. Sports bras are
    comfortable and make your chest appear a little
    smaller.[3]![](Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Acquire some boat shoes, loafers, canvas shoes, and dark-colored or
    tan
    flip-flops.![](Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Find a nice watch that you can wear every day. Also, invest in a
    good pair of sunglasses (Ray Bans, aviators,
    etc.).![](Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Don't be afraid to wear some funky socks. They can be easily hidden
    from sight, or you can roll up your pant legs to show them
    off.[4]![](Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Purchase a messenger bag or purse to carry things around when
    needed, but don't have it with you all the time. Buy a wallet which
    you can slip into your back pocket when you leave your bag
    behind.![](Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Lesbian_Chic_Step_8.jpg")

## Tips

-   J.Crew factory is your new best friend. Not only does the factory
    store sell items at lower prices than regular J.Crew, but it also
    carries a wide array of clothing that suits this look. Places like
    Madewell and Banana Republic sell some of these items as well.
-   Jewelry is fine as long as it isn't excessive. Some bracelets and
    earrings will do.
-   Be sure to iron everything so that it appears fresh and crisp. This
    will also help you look more put-together.
-   Makeup is optional, though some eyeliner and/or lip gloss will
    definitely make you appear more polished.
-   Any hairstyle will do, but shorter styles often compliment this
    style well.
-   Try to eat healthy and remain physically fit.
-   Pea coats, gloves/mittens, and knit hats are good for winter. Be
    sure to get a hold of a pair of boots for the snow.
-   Maintain good hygiene--floss, brush your teeth, wash your face,
    shower daily, trim your finger- and toenails, etc.
-   Non-lesbians can dress this way as well. The fact that a woman
    chooses this look does not mean that she is gay and vice versa.
