## Steps

1.  Wear crop tops, high waisted skirts, leather jackets and converse to
    get that girly look. Mostly wear black leather high waisted skirts,
    you'll get more people getting jealous, or wear pink converse, pink
    goes best with crop tops, and have crop tops that have weird
    patterns on
    it.![](Dress_Like_You_Have_Swag_(Girls)_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_You_Have_Swag_(Girls)_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Wear Nike trainers, leather leggings, with a collard top and a
    hoodie to get the tomboy look. Wear blue 'Nike' and make sure the
    collard top is blue they have to match but wear black leggings and
    black hoodie. It works for me so it will for you

3.  Wear your hair up, for the tomboy look. Or wear your hair down with
    curls to get the girly look. Most of the girls have brown hair with
    blonde dip dye or multi hair
    color.![](Dress_Like_You_Have_Swag_(Girls)_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_You_Have_Swag_(Girls)_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Don't put too much make up on. All you need is lipstick/lip gloss
    and mascara. Wear bright red lipstick, with false lashes the boys
    will be falling for
    you.![](Dress_Like_You_Have_Swag_(Girls)_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_You_Have_Swag_(Girls)_Step_4.jpg")
