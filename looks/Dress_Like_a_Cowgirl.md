2.  Wear a button-down shirt. These shirts can either be short-sleeved
    or long-sleeved. For a more casual look, wear a
    t-shirt.![](Dress_Like_a_Cowgirl_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Cowgirl_Step_2.jpg")
    -   Roll the sleeves of your button-down at your elbows.
3.  Find a Western-style cowboy hat. These kinds of hats come in black,
    brown, tan, and
    white.![](Dress_Like_a_Cowgirl_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Cowgirl_Step_3.jpg")
    -   If you don't want to wear a hat, try a bandana that matches the
        color of your button-up shirt. Keep the tied part on the side of
        your head, and tie it like a bow.
4.  Get a pair of cowboy boots. Traditionally, cowboy boots are made of
    leather, but are also available in faux-leather and exotic skins
    like alligator, snake, and buffalo. These boots also come in a
    variety of toe styles: round toe, square toe, or pointed
    toe.![](Dress_Like_a_Cowgirl_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Cowgirl_Step_4.jpg")
    -   If you plan on wearing your boots in muddy or wet conditions,
        consider getting a pair with rubber soles.
5.  Wear your hair down in braids or a low
    ponytail.![](Dress_Like_a_Cowgirl_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Cowgirl_Step_5.jpg")

### Accessories (Optional)

1.  Tie a bandana around your neck. Traditional cowboys and cowgirls
    alike used bandanas to absorb their sweat while working on the
    ranch. Nowadays, bandanas are mostly worn as a fashion
    statement.![](Dress_Like_a_Cowgirl_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Cowgirl_Step_6.jpg")
    -   Tie the bandana behind your neck so that the triangle part is
        facing your front. (Only if you wore the cowgirl hat instead of
        the bandana)
2.  Wear a Western-style belt. Cowgirl belts are usually made of brown
    leather, and have large silver, gold, or turquoise buckles. For
    extra flare, find one with braided or medallion
    embellishments.![](Dress_Like_a_Cowgirl_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Cowgirl_Step_7.jpg")

## Tips

-   Consider buying cowboy boots, belts, and hats second-hand from a
    thrift store, as they can be quite expensive.
-   Look around your house, you can probably find stuff that adds to
    your costume!
-   Wear little to no makeup on your face. Authentic cowgirls are
    au-natural.
