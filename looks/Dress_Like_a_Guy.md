Dressing like a guy doesn't have to be difficult, whether you are a
woman trying to dress like a guy or a guy who is trying to achieve a
more masculine look. Paying attention to the shape, cut, and quality of
your clothing can help you achieve a more masculine look

## Steps

### Dressing Like a Guy

1.  Find casual pants with a masculine fit. Casual pants that fit well
    are a staple in a male wardrobe, as they can be worn in most
    everyday situations.
    [1]![](Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   **Jeans** are the most versatile pant. They should be worn an
        inch or two lower on the waist than chinos or corduroys, about
        three to four inches below your navel. Jeans should have a
        consistent fit throughout the leg. Avoid jeans that are too
        tight in the thigh and loose under the knee. Slim-style jeans
        flatter most body types.
    -   **Sweatpants** are the most casual pant, usually worn in
        athletic or relaxing situations. When wearing sweatpants out in
        public, try brands that also make formal pants; they're more
        likely to fit slimmer and look better than the typical gym
        sweatpants found in discount stores. Pair sweatpants with other
        well-fitting clothes and a pair of high-end sneakers to avoid
        looking too aloof. [2]
2.  Choose the right fit for dress pants. Formal pants are important for
    presenting a clean, conservative look- perfect for the office and
    special
    events.![](Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   **Suit pants and dress trousers** are the most formal pant
        option. The top of the pants should come to the top of your hip
        bone. They should fit well enough in the waist that you don't
        need a belt, but drape more loosely over the legs. Avoid wearing
        pleated pants, as they can add the illusion of extra weight,
        especially in the seat.
    -   **Chinos and corduroys** offer a more casual look than suit
        pants, but can still be worn in most professional environments.
        These should fit slimmer than suit pants and worn an inch or two
        lower on the waist. If you're wearing chinos in a conservative
        setting, opt for a slightly looser fit. If wearing casually, you
        can size them slimmer. You can tell when these pants are too
        tight if the pockets don't lay flat against the pants, creating
        "pocket flares." When shopping for chinos, keep in mind that the
        waist and seat tend to stretch with wear.
3.  Wear casual shirts that fit well. Casual shirts, despite their
    informality, can look great when sized and worn correctly. They can
    be worn with chinos, jeans, or
    sweatpants.![](Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   **T-shirts and long-sleeved shirts** are more casual than
        button-ups and sweaters. They should fit looser around the neck.
        If a shirt has a V-neck, the cut of the V should go no deeper
        than your sternum. A t-shirt or long-sleeved shirt should have a
        slim fit through the torso, a little looser than a button-up.
        The shirt should be long enough to cover the belt loops of your
        pants without going past the pants zipper. Longer, looser
        T-shirts are best for a laid-back vibe, while more fitted,
        shorter T-shirts look sleeker. Many T-shirts and long-sleeved
        shirts are made primarily of cotton, which shrinks easily when
        washed. Size up or hang dry your shirts to avoid shrinkage.
    -   **Undershirts** should be worn under other kinds of shirts. They
        should fit tighter than a T-shirt, and have the same kind of
        collar as the shirt you're wearing over it. Choose a color like
        gray that will match most kinds of shirts and be inconspicuous
        under other clothing.
4.  Wear the right kind of dress shirt to complete a formal look. Dress
    shirts are another necessary staple in the male wardrobe. A
    well-fitted dress shirt rounds off an outfit to create a crisp,
    professional
    look.[3]![](Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   **Button-up shirts** can be worn for professional and casual
        situations. The collar of a button-up shirt should fit as
        closely to the neck without constricting it. The sleeves should
        fit well, without being too tight or too loose. The shirt cuff
        should come to where your wrist meets your hand. The body of the
        shirt should fit closely to your torso, without being
        skin-tight. A button-up should come down just past the belt
        loops in length. They should be worn tucked in to pants for a
        refined look; however, they can be worn untucked with jeans or
        chinos in a more informal climate.
    -   **Sweaters** can also be worn in both formal and informal
        settings. They should fit slim throughout the body. Thin
        sweaters can fit tighter while chunky sweaters can fit a little
        looser. Thin sweaters should be worn to your belt loops; thicker
        sweaters and cardigans can be worn long. Crew neck sweaters
        should allow plenty of room for your neck and a collared shirt
        underneath. The neckline ofV-neck sweaters should dip down no
        further than the middle of your sternum. Turtleneck sweaters
        should fit tighter in the neck, while shawl neck sweaters are
        loose in the neck. No one kind of sweater is considered more or
        less formal; they all can be worn in a variety of situations.[4]
5.  Dress for your body type. Different clothes flatter different body
    types and have ways of making you look more
    masculine.[5][6]![](Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
    -   To hide wider hips and thighs, wear tapered pants.
    -   To hide a bigger chest, wear tops with prints and asymmetrical
        patterns.
    -   To look taller and thinner, wear vertical stripes.
    -   To look less lanky, wear horizontal stripes.
    -   To slim your waistline, wear a belt.
    -   To look thinner, wear monochromatic colors.
    -   No matter the body type, buying clothes that fit properly will
        ensure you look your best in any men's outfit.
6.  Complete a formal outfit with the right dress shoes. Shoes can make
    or break an outfit, and are especially important to pair correctly
    with dress
    clothes.[7]![](Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   **Oxfords**- Lace-up shoes worn below the ankle, usually made of
        leather. Work best with a two-piece suit.
    -   **Loafers**-Slip-on shoes without laces, often made of leather.
        Less formal than oxfords. Can be worn with a suit or with more
        casual pants.
    -   **Dress Boots**- Usually made of leather and come in a variety
        of styles. Come up high on the ankle and lace up. Should not be
        worn with a suit, but can be worn with chinos, corduroys, or
        jeans.
7.  Find a casual shoe that meets your needs. There is a wide range of
    casual men's footwear options, varying in comfort and
    functionality.![](Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_7.jpg")
    -   **Saddle Shoes**- Similar to Oxfords, but have a layer of
        leather over the instep of the shoes, making them two-toned.
        Should not be worn with a suit, but can be worn with any kind of
        pants.
    -   **Top-Siders**- Also called "boat shoes." Have a moccasin-style
        and thick rubber bottom. Can be worn with or without socks and
        work best with chinos, corduroys, jeans, or shorts. Should only
        be worn in the summer.
    -   **Canvas Shoes**- Usually describes sneakers with a canvas body
        and rubber sole. Can be low on the ankle or come up high over
        the ankle. Able to be worn with chinos, jeans, or shorts.
        Converse All-Star sneakers are the stereotypical example.
    -   **Casual Loafers**- Slip-on shoe, distinctive from the dressy
        version by a heavy, rubber sole. Can be worn with or without
        socks, with chinos, jeans, or shorts.
    -   **Sandals**- Open-toed shoes that protect the bottom of the foot
        while allowing open circulation on the top and sides. Flip-flops
        are a popular type of sandals. Work best with chinos, jeans, and
        shorts, and are most appropriate in warm weather.
    -   **Athletic Shoes**- Sneakers that are usually made entirely of
        rubber, especially on the sole. Should be worn mostly with
        activewear and only in athletic and very casual instances.
    -   **Work Boots**- Heavy-duty, solidly-made boots made to withstand
        long hours working outside. Commonly referred to as
        "construction" boots. Should only be worn during labored tasks
        such as yard work or moving heavy items.
    -   **Hiking Boots**- Come up high to support the ankle, are
        well-cushioned, and lightweight. These are the best footwear for
        outdoor sporting events in rough terrain.
8.  Find shoes in your size. Buy men's shoes in a size and a half
    smaller than what you wear in women's shoes. For example, if you're
    typically a size 7 in women's shoes, try a 5.5 in men's shoes.[8]

### Accessorizing Like a Guy

1.  Don a hat. Hats are a great way to hide your hair and add to your
    outfit. Different occasions and environments call for different
    types of
    hats.[9]![](Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_9.jpg")
    -   A baseball cap is commonly worn among men, and generally
        considered to be informal. It can make a specific statement
        about who you are if it contains a sports team logo or company
        name.
    -   A fedora is a great way to complete a formal outfit.
    -   A beanie is an informal hat, better for colder weather
    -   A Panama hat is a popular option for a laid-back place- perfect
        for a vacation. .
    -   A cowboy hat works well in a ranch setting or somewhere with a
        Southwestern feel.
2.  Put on a belt. Belts serve the functional purpose of keeping pants
    in place, as well as tying together the top and bottom half of an
    outfit. The belt you wear should match in formality with your
    outfit. Try a leather belt for more formal clothing and a canvas
    belt for more casual threads
    [10].![](Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_10.jpg")
3.  Don't wear much jewelry. Generally speaking, men don't wear a lot of
    jewelry. If you want to wear jewelry, keep it simple. Often a
    singular piece, like a watch or a chain, will do.
    [11].![](Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_11.jpg")

### Styling Your Hair Like a Guy

1.  Wear your hair short. Most men prefer shorter hairstyles. If you're
    not ready to give up your long, feminine locks, try tying them back
    in a ponytail or sporting a "man bun." If you want to cut your hair
    short, familiarize yourself with the names of different men's
    hairstyles before getting it
    cut.[12]![](Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Taper Cut- A short haircut with the sides and back of the head
        cut progressively shorter down toward the neck.
    -   Bowl Cut- Longer hair around the top of the head, shorter hair
        around the lower part of the head, with little or no blending in
        between the two lengths. Looks like someone placed a bowl on
        your head and simply cut around it.
    -   Brush Cut- Short, tapered hair around the sides of the head,
        uniform in length at the top of the head. Hair at the top of the
        head is styled straight up to resemble the bristles of a brush.
    -   Business Man's Cut- Generic term for a shorter (but not too
        short), conservative haircut, appropriate for the office. Hair
        is short and tapered around the sides and longer at the top to
        allow for a part.
    -   Caesar Cut- Back and sides are tapered, while hair at the top of
        the head is layered one to two inches in length. The top hair is
        combed forward giving the effect of bangs.
    -   Crew Cut- Very short cut that is tapered on the back and sides
        and top of the head.
    -   Fade- Extremely tapered cut, with hair on the sides and back cut
        very close to the head and tapered upward to a longer length at
        the top of the head.
    -   Flat Top- Back and sides are very tapered, while hair on the top
        is cut to stand straight up.
2.  Use men's hairstyling products. There are several different kinds of
    hairstyling products that can help to maintain a masculine
    hairstyle. Each product is used to achieve a specific
    look.[13]![](Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Pomade- Use on shorter styles, to create texture.
    -   Wax- Use to add shine.
    -   Mud- Use on longer styles, to create a "disheveled" look.
    -   Cream- Use to control frizz.
    -   Gel- Use for a strong hold or to create a "wet" look.
    -   Hairspray- Use to add volume and greater control to hair.
3.  Cut your neck hair and sideburns. With shorter hairstyles, men need
    to be more conscious of the hair on the backs of their necks and the
    way their sideburns look. They have less hair to hide under than
    most women do. Be sure to talk to your barber about how you want
    your neck hair and sideburns cut and
    shaped.![](Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Guy_Step_14.jpg")

## Tips

-   Ultimately, there is no one correct way to dress like a guy. Men
    come from a variety of backgrounds, personalities, and physical
    statures. Dress how you want, in a way that expresses who you are
    and makes you feel comfortable.
-   Finding men's outfits that work best for you may require some trial
    and error. Embrace the changes and learn from the growth!
