Dressing like a lady is all about choosing clothing that's appropriate
and that you feel great wearing. For the most ladylike outfits, pick out
clothes in neutral tones and get your clothing tailored so that it fits
you well. Avoid exposing too much skin by selecting skirts and dresses
of an appropriate length, and use accessories to your advantage.

## Steps

### Cultivating Your Wardrobe

1.  Dress appropriately for the occasion. You’ll dress a little
    differently going to a work meeting than you would a night out with
    friends. Make sure your ladylike outfit fits the occasion and that
    you feel comfortable and confident in your
    choice.[1]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_1.jpg")
    -   Wear a pantsuit or tea-length skirt to a meeting or to the
        office.
    -   Put on shorts of an appropriate length and a light blouse to run
        errands during the summer.
    -   Wear an above-the-knee black dress for a night out.
2.  Keep your outfit modest and classy. One of the most important parts
    of dressing like a lady is showing skin sparingly. You don’t have to
    only wear pants and shirts with high necklines, but try not to
    expose too much cleavage or wear skirts and shorts that are super
    short. It's also a good idea to avoid wearing excessively-tight
    clothing to stay
    classy.[2]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_2.jpg")
    -   Exposing some of your back, ankles, or clavicle keeps your
        outfit classy yet feminine.
    -   Try to keep your skirts, shorts, and dresses above the knee or
        longer.
    -   V-neck blouses or shirts are appropriate for work, while an
        off-the-shoulder top is good for a night out or casual wear.
3.  Choose a neutral color palette for your clothing. White, black,
    gray, navy, beige, and pastel colors create outfits that look very
    sophisticated and classy. Neutral colors will also look more
    expensive and give you a wide variety of pairing options when it
    comes to mixing and matching your
    wardrobe.[3]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_3.jpg")
    -   Wear a black wrap dress during the day and add a beige shawl at
        night.
    -   Put on white linen pants and a pastel blouse on a warm summer
        day.
    -   Add a pop of color such as a bright blue scarf to complement a
        neutral-colored outfit.
4.  Invest in timeless pieces for a great wardrobe. There are some key
    pieces of clothing that look sophisticated and never go out of
    style, such as a trench coat or leather jacket. If necessary, spend
    a little extra to buy a piece of clothing that you’ll wear a lot and
    will always take your outfit to the next
    level.[4]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_4.jpg")
    -   Invest in a winter trench coat with a warm lining, or a summer
        trench coat made of a light material.
    -   Look for staple pieces that you can wear repeatedly, such as
        ballet pumps, a well-cut suede jacket, or a classy black
        handbag.
5.  Pick out quality fabrics that will last. The materials and textures
    that your clothing is made out of have a big impact when it comes to
    making your outfit look ladylike. Choose fabrics that will last and
    look nice, such as cotton, silk, wool, suede, and
    leather.[5]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_5.jpg")
    -   Avoid super stretchy fabrics such as spandex.
    -   If you’re wearing a see-through material, such as chiffon, make
        sure you wear something underneath it.
6.  Avoid flashy outfits and large logos. Clothing made of vibrant
    colors or fabrics, such as neons or shiny spandex, can be
    distracting. Try to stick to calmer colors, and stay away from large
    logos or pictures on shirts or
    dresses.[6]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_6.jpg")
    -   Clothing covered in sequins, vibrant patterns, or other flashy
        materials doesn't look sophisticated or classy.
7.  Layer your clothing. Layering is a simple way to make your outfit
    look thought-out and stylish. Since your color palette will mostly
    be made of neutrals, it’s also a good way to combine different
    colors with your outfit. Use jackets, sweaters, and shawls to add
    layers over your dress or
    shirt.[7]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_7.jpg")
    -   Wear a shawl over your dress in the summer, or layer a sweater
        over a blouse in the colder months (you can even add a
        trenchcoat over the sweater, if desired).
    -   Wear tights under a dress or skirt in colder weather.
8.  Dress to instill confidence in yourself. You should feel confident,
    comfortable, and put-together in your clothing. Instead of choosing
    clothing just because you think a lady would wear it, make sure
    you’re wearing pieces that you truly like and feel good
    in.[8]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_8.jpg")
    -   Check blogs or websites like Pinterest for ladylike outfit
        inspiration.

### Building Specific Outfits

1.  Opt for longer skirts and dresses. Making sure the length of your
    skirts and dresses comes to at least your knee will ensure your
    outfit always looks classy. Skirts and dresses tend to come in many
    lengths, such as knee-length, tea-length, and maxi, giving you
    options when it comes to how short or long you'd like your outfit to
    be.[9]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_9.jpg")
    -   You can hem a longer skirt or dress to make it just the right
        length for you.
    -   A good rule of thumb is to place your arms at your sides with
        your fingers outstretched--if your skirt, dress, or shorts are
        shorter than your fingertips, they're too short.
2.  Find a skirt suit or pantsuit for an elegant work option. A skirt
    suit is a good option if you want a more feminine work look, while a
    pantsuit always looks professional. You can even get the suit
    tailored to fit your curves, making it look even more
    feminine.[10]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Wear a colored blouse with a black pantsuit and heels.
    -   Opt for a pastel-colored skirt suit and a white blouse
        underneath.
3.  Select a-line or shift dresses for a sophisticated look. These types
    of dresses (and skirts) are just the right amount of
    form-fitting—they’ll accentuate your figure while keeping the outfit
    classy and tasteful. Look for dresses with a circle skirt, or skirts
    that flow gently down your
    legs.[11]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_11.jpg")
    -   For a casual outfit, pair a plain v-neck shirt with a maxi
        skirt.
    -   Wear a gray shift dress to work, run errands, or eat out.
4.  Wear high-waisted skirts and trousers to show off your figure. These
    will make your legs look longer, and they look especially classy
    when you tuck in your shirt or blouse. Make sure the high-waisted
    skirt or pants fit you well and aren’t too baggy or
    long.[12]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Wear gray high-waisted pants that pull together in a bow, paired
        with a white top and a statement necklace.
    -   Put on a white lace high-waisted skirt with a navy blue blouse.
5.  Pick out blouses to go with pants, shorts, and skirts. Blouses are a
    classy option that can be paired with skirts, shorts, and pants.
    Blouses made of materials such as chiffon or silk look sophisticated
    and hold up well—just make sure to wear a camisole underneath, if
    necessary.[13]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Wear a white button-up blouse with a pair of black cuffed jeans.
    -   Tuck a light blue blouse into a fitted white skirt.

### Adding the Details

1.  Tailor your clothing so that it fits well. Clothing with a good cut
    and fit will elevate your wardrobe and make you look professional
    and put-together. Check to make sure your sleeves and pants legs are
    the proper lengths, and get any baggy clothing tailored so that you
    feel comfortable and confident in
    it.[14]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_14.jpg")
    -   For example, get pants hemmed so that they're right below your
        ankles.
    -   Long-sleeved clothing should reach your wrist, allowing you to
        move your hands freely.
    -   If a blazer is too baggy or a skirt is too big, get it tailored
        so that it fits you well.
2.  Pay attention to your accessories. Things such as your shoes and
    handbags will bring your outfit together. Choose heels or wedges
    that are a reasonable height, or ballet flats for a classic look.
    Pick out a handbag made of a durable and classy material, such as
    leather or suede, that you can use with many
    outfits.[15]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_15.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_15.jpg")
    -   A black leather handbag is an accessory you can use almost every
        day.
    -   If you're wearing heels, make sure the heel isn't too high—you
        want to look classy while also being able to walk easily, so
        stick to a heel no taller than .
    -   Muted or pastel colors always make for a suitable handbag or
        shoe.
3.  Invest in quality undergarments. If the lining of your bra is
    showing through your shirt or dress, or the bra doesn’t seem to fit
    well, find one that is more comfortable and seamless with your
    outfit. It’s also a good idea to invest in other undergarments such
    as slips that you can wear under dresses or see-through articles of
    clothing.[16]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_16_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_16_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Get a [bra fitting](Choose_the_Right_Bra "wikilink") so that you
        know you're wearing the right size.
4.  Choose 1 or 2 classic pieces of jewelry to wear. Wearing too much
    jewelry can distract from the rest of your outfit. Try to choose a
    couple of pieces, such as a pearl necklace or diamond earrings, to
    add a little sparkle or sophistication to your
    outfit.[17]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_17.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_17.jpg")
    -   Other classic pieces of jewelry might include gold bangles, a
        silver bracelet, or a statement necklace.
5.  Style your hair to look great with your outfit. You’ll want to give
    your hair some attention as it’s just as much part of your
    appearance as your clothing. Brush straight hair to give it some
    shine, or pull back curly hair from your face in a barrette or
    fabric
    headband.[18]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_18.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_18.jpg")
    -   Give your hair some soft [curls](Curl_Hair "wikilink"), or pull
        it back into a professional ponytail.
    -   [Straighten your hair](Straighten_Your_Hair "wikilink") to
        remove any kinks or uneven patches for a smooth look.
6.  Opt for [neutral makeup](Apply_Makeup_for_a_Natural_Look "wikilink")
    for a classy look. While you can wear blush, eyeliner, mascara, and
    other types of makeup, try to keep it minimal—you don’t want your
    makeup to be distracting or overbearing. A small amount of makeup
    creates an elegant and ladylike
    look.[19]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_19.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_19.jpg")
    -   Put on some red lipstick to take your look to the next level, if
        desired.
7.  Make sure your clothing is clean and wrinkle-free. Even if you have
    the perfect outfit, if it’s wrinkled or has lots of lint on it, it
    won’t look very good. Iron or steam your clothes if they’re
    wrinkled, and use a lint roller to remove any pet hairs or other
    pieces of
    lint.[20]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_20.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_20.jpg")
    -   Check the label on your clothing to make sure that they can be
        ironed or steamed to avoid damaging them.
8.  Polish your nails to complete your look. If you like to keep your
    nails painted, stick to neutral colors—these will match your
    clothing well and won’t be distracting. Colors such as a pale pink
    look lovely and
    ladylike.[21]![](Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_21.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Lady_Step_21.jpg")
    -   Try a French manicure for a put-together look.
    -   It’s more important for your fingernails to be in muted tones
        than your toenails—you can choose a more vibrant color for your
        toenails if desired, such as a red or light blue.

## Tips

-   Pair high-end items with less expensive pieces to create great
    outfits while saving money.
-   Avoid wearing athletic clothing unless you're working out or going
    to the gym.
-   You do not have to buy designer clothing. Just ensure the clothes
    are of good quality.
