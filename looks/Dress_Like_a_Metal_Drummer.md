As much as you would love to deny it, you'll have to admit it at some
point. Metal drummers [look cool](Look_Cool "wikilink"). You may want to
dress like one yourself but not quite know how. In reality, it's fairly
simple. You may even have the clothes in your own closet. Follow these
steps to dress like a [drummer](Drum_the_Metal_Way "wikilink") from the
[Metal scene](Be_Metal "wikilink").

## Steps

1.  Research some Metal drummers. Before you can start dressing like a
    Metal drummer, you need to know what one or two actually look like.
    Now days, concerts aren't the only place you can see or meet a band.
    Websites like Google and Youtube give you an opportunity to see
    these drummers for free. Feel free to take advantage of this and
    start looking at pictures
    of:![](Dress_Like_a_Metal_Drummer_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Metal_Drummer_Step_1.jpg")
    -   Jimmy "The Rev" Sullivan (Avenged Sevenfold)
    -   Mike Wengren (Disturbed)
    -   Dave Lombardo (Slayer)
    -   Vinnie Paul (Pantera)
    -   Lars Ulrich (Metallica)
    -   Your favourite Metal drummer
2.  Get the hair. Metal drummers usually have fairly long hair. If you
    don't have or like long hair, short but thick hair will also work.
    They have this type of hair so when they
    [headbang](Headbang "wikilink") at the "break-down" of their songs,
    it will fly everywhere and look awesome. Due to all the headbanging
    and all the time they spend on tour, these Metal drummers' hair is
    usually un-brushed and a bit scruffy/messed up. You don't have to
    leave your hair un-brushed but headbanging and letting it fall out
    of shape never
    hurts.![](Dress_Like_a_Metal_Drummer_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Metal_Drummer_Step_2.jpg")
3.  T-shirts. Any Metal band t-shirt will do but drummers are sometimes
    known for being the [funny](Be_Funny "wikilink") and
    [creative](Be_Creative "wikilink") person in the band. For this
    reason, and to back up this stereotype, drummers are known for
    wearing shirts with funny quotes or pictures on them. Don't be
    afraid to wear something with a swear word or inappropriate language
    on it, they do wear shirts like that too. Anything that you stand
    for or believe can be worn on your t-shirt
    too.![](Dress_Like_a_Metal_Drummer_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Metal_Drummer_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Jeans. Skinny jeans, black jeans or distressed jeans all fit in with
    Metal drummers. They sometimes wear slightly looser jeans so they
    can use their [double bass](Play_Double_Bass_Drums "wikilink") and
    hi-hat pedals easily. Whatever jeans you can find work well, as long
    as they are dark. [Distressing](Make_Distressed_Jeans "wikilink")
    and [laddering]("Ladder"_Jeans "wikilink") jeans are two very
    popular techniques amongst Metal drummers, and the Metal scene as a
    whole.![](Dress_Like_a_Metal_Drummer_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Metal_Drummer_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Shoes. Shoes are obviously a must. The Metal and
    [Punk](Be_a_Punk "wikilink") scenes like to wear combat boots so
    they can stand firm in a [mosh pit](Mosh_in_a_Mosh_Pit "wikilink").
    While combat boots do look cool, they're not very practical when
    trying to use your double bass and high-hat pedals. Metal drummers
    like to wear Converse shoes and well-fitting Vans shoes. Vans
    slip-on shoes tend to slip off when you use your pedals but if they
    fit well on you, go for
    it.![](Dress_Like_a_Metal_Drummer_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Metal_Drummer_Step_5.jpg")
