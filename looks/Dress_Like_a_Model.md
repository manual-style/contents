Do you daydream about dressing like the models you see on the catwalk
and in magazines? You don’t have to become a model to resemble their
style. Anyone can dress like a model regardless of their shape, size, or
looks. To dress like a model, choose the right outfit, pick out
accessories, and adopt the model attitude.

## Steps

### Choosing the Right Outfit

1.  Find a person or style to inspire you. You don't want to be exactly
    like one certain model, but using a specific model (or models) is a
    great way to get inspiration and develop a style plate for your own
    wardrobe. Some models that you could draw inspiration from are Kate
    Moss, Ashley Graham, Iman, and Shaun
    Ross.[1]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Go to public runways. Around fashion week, there are sometimes a
        public runway, so everybody can see the newest trends. Fashion
        weeks for women are held in February and September/October.
        Fashion weeks for men are held in January and June/July.[2]
2.  Wear a basic outfit to present yourself as a blank canvas. Models
    often go for a simple and clean look. This is because model scouts
    and agents like the blank canvas look. A simple look usually means
    that there aren’t a lot of wild designs, colors, or accessories.
    Choose simple designs with muted colors. A classic basic outfit is
    an all-black or an all-white
    outfit.[3]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   A simple black outfit may include a black blazer, black T-shirt
        (crew or V-neck), and black skinny jeans.
    -   For something more feminine, try a simple straight-cut dress
        with 3/4-length sleeves, and minimal seams.
    -   Another example of a basic outfit could be light denim skinny
        jeans with a basic white T-shirt and a pastel cardigan.
3.  Get a fitted jacket to use as a versatile addition to your wardrobe.
    A fitted jacket is a staple of a model’s wardrobe because it can be
    dressed up or down. Look for a jacket that is high-quality and fits
    you very well. The material you choose doesn’t matter, but a fitted
    leather jacket is common.\*If you can’t find a jacket that fits
    perfectly, consider taking it to a
    tailor.[4]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For an edgy look, try a black mini skirt, a black tank top, and
        a fitted black crop jacket. Finish the look with tall, black
        boots.
    -   For a tomboy look, try long black shorts that come down to your
        knees and a black T-shirt. Wear a fitted, black leather jacket
        over that.
    -   For a chic look, try navy blue pencil slacks, a black T-shirt,
        and a fitted, black blazer. Finish the look with your choice of
        shoes, such as black sneakers, converse, or oxfords.
4.  Try skinny jeans if you want to show off your body shape. For
    example, if you want to lengthen your legs or show off your ankle,
    pair cropped skinny jeans with ankle boots. Light-colored skinny
    jeans will look more casual, but black skinny jeans can be dressed
    up or down depending on the
    accessories.[5]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For a casual look, pair black skinny jeans with a black blouse
        and black high-top converse. Finish the look with a
        brightly-colored blazer or plaid shirt. Leave the blazer or
        plaid shirt open.
    -   If you like to layer your clothes, try black skinny jeans with
        colorful sneakers and a blouse of some sort. Layer on a cardigan
        and overcoat, along with a scarf or two.
    -   For a dressier look, try black skinny jeans with a nice blouse
        and cardigan in a contrasting color. Finish the look with a silk
        scarf, a handbag, and black ankle boots.
5.  Wear layers if you desire something more chic. Mix-and-match fitted
    garments and loose garments, such as a loose cardigan over a fitted
    tank top. If you wear too many loose layers, you'll look bulky; if
    you wear too many fitted layers, your silhouette will look too
    mundane.[6]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Mix-and-match textures. Try a black meshy blouse over a white,
        silk blouse. Finish the look with a black chiffon vest and a
        black leather blazer.
    -   Play around with length. Wear a lacy, white blouse over a tank
        top of your choosing. Put a knee-length white cardigan over
        that. Finish the look with a hip-length jacket or blazer in army
        green.
    -   Play with pattern and color. Wear a cable-knit sweater over a
        long, striped shirt. Top it off with a hip-length plaid coat and
        a brightly colored skirt. If it's chilly, add leggings and a
        skirt.[7]
6.  Mix prints if you want to go bold. Fashion is all about
    experimentation, so mixing prints is encouraged. For instance, wear
    striped pants with a polka dot shirt and animal print sweater.
    Another example of mixing prints is wearing a shirt with pineapples,
    a plaid cardigan, and striped
    pants.[8]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Pair bold prints with solid colors. Try a long, blouse with a
        bright, geometric print over a black mini skirt of black skinny
        jeans. Finish the look with black ankle boots and a black blazer
        or jacket.
    -   Mix-and-match pints of you are feeling bold. Wear baggy pants
        and jackets in matching or similar prints; they can be the same
        color or different ones. Add a solid-colored tank top and shoes.
    -   Play around with dresses in bold prints. Try a bright floral
        print, or a black-and-white geometric print. Finish the outfit
        with shoes that match the background of the print and some
        jewelry.[9]

### Picking Out Accessories

1.  Pick a pair of high heels if you want something versatile. They can
    make you appear taller, slimmer, and give you better posture. Keep
    in mind that high heels are hard on your body, especially if worn
    for long periods of time. Only wear them if they are not painful to
    you.[10]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_7.jpg")
    -   A pair of black stilettos can go with a variety of outfits, from
        skinny jeans to little black dresses. They give off the model
        vibe the most.
    -   You can also wear heels like wedges and platforms. Make yourself
        look more model-like by paying attention to the rest of your
        clothing.
2.  Wear flats or boots if heels are too painful for you. You don’t have
    to exclusively wear high heels to be a model, especially if feminine
    fashion is not for you. A single pair of flats is not very
    versatile, because it won't go with *every* outfit. Luckily, there
    are lots of different styles to choose
    from.[11]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_8.jpg")
    -   Some other examples of flats are ballet flats, moccasins,
    -   For a feminine or boho look, try ballet flats or moccasins. They
        go well with flowy blouses and dresses.
    -   For a chic look, try loafers, tennis shoes, or oxfords. They go
        well with blazers.
    -   For a masculine or tomboy look, try Doc. Martens or any other
        type of lace-up boots.
3.  Put on sunglasses if you want to look more stylish. Not only will
    they make you look more stylish, but they will also protect your
    eyes from the sun's harsh rays. You don’t have to purchase expensive
    designer sunglasses either. Basic styles to consider
    include:[12]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Aviators
    -   Cat-eye
    -   Rounded
4.  Bring a handbag if you like to carry purses. A handbag is a great
    way to complete any outfit. Ideally, it should match the color of
    your outfit; if you are wearing a print, then match it to the
    background color. Alternatively, you can try a neutral color, such
    as black or
    white.[13]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Silver or gold are great neutral colors as well, and go well
        with most other colors.
    -   If you prefer backpacks, look for a simple leather backpack
        instead.
    -   You can also carry a tote bag or a purse in a fun shape (like
        lips or a spaceship).
5.  Wear quirky socks to liven up a simple outfit. Quirky socks work
    best when they can be seen. For example, wear them with cropped
    skinny jeans or a skirt. You can wear socks with unexpected things
    on them, like breakfast foods, or choose a funky, bright
    pattern.[14]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_11.jpg")
    -   The socks don’t have to have patterns, you can also wear socks
        with lace ruffles in a variety of colors.
    -   You can also wear quirky socks with sandal heels.
    -   Make sure that the socks are visible. For example, if you are
        wearing converse and quirky socks, choose a pair of cropped
        pants so that you can see part of the socks.

### Adopting the Model Attitude

1.  Stand up straight. Good posture is not only good for your back, but
    it also makes you appear confident. Walk with your shoulders pressed
    down and back. When you sit, maintain good posture. Sit with your
    ankles crossed, or your feet parallel to each other on the
    ground.[15]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Some outfits help with posture, such as bodices and corsets.
        Fitted blazers and vests may also help.
    -   Avoid wearing heavy bags, as they can affect your posture.
2.  [Be healthy.](Be_Healthy "wikilink") Maintaining good health is
    great for your body, and it will help add to your model appearance.
    However, remember, that you don't need to be a size zero to
    [look](Look_Beautiful "wikilink") beautiful. Simply take care of
    yourself. Hit the gym two or three times a week.
    [Eat](Eat_Healthy "wikilink") healthily. Take care of your
    [skin](Have_Perfect_Skin "wikilink"), and drink plenty of
    [water](Drink_More_Water_Every_Day "wikilink").[16]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Instead of going to the gym, you can follow videos on YouTube
        for yoga at home or take a jog outside.
    -   Invest in a good cleanser, day and night moisturizer, and
        sunscreen. Ask a skincare consultant at your local beauty shop
        for advice for your specific type of skin.
3.  [Build self-confidence.](Build_Self_Confidence "wikilink") This is a
    crucial step when dressing like a model. It's important to know that
    you look and feel good in what you are wearing, whether it's
    high-end fashion or a bargain bin
    find.[17]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_14.jpg")
    -   If you feel you look great in something, then you will look
        great.
    -   Another way to build self-confidence is to stop caring what
        others think of you.
4.  Be bold. Being a model isn't always about following the trends, it's
    about showing off what you think looks good. Don’t be afraid to take
    a chance on wearing an outfit that you think is not trendy. Showing
    off what you enjoy wearing can inspire others to do the
    same.[18]![](Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_15.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Model_Step_15.jpg")
    -   This goes hand-in-hand with confidence. If you are going to
        dress and act bold, then you will need to have some confidence
        too.

## Tips

-   Be creative in the style you want. Being a model is about being
    confident and bold. Wear what you love and be who you are.
-   If you feel that none of the magazine styles are working for you,
    experiment! Get different clothes and accessories, and see what
    looks best on you.
-   Models try different unique styles because of their confidence. They
    always choose comfortable, but eye-catching pieces that celebrate
    their body.
-   If wearing tights or stockings go for sheer black ones or fishnets.

## Warnings

-   Dressing like a model should have nothing to do with size. Don’t
    feel like you need to alter your weight in order to dress like a
    model.
