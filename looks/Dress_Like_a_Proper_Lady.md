Have you ever wondered how to dress like a proper lady? Well, read on in
this article to learn some fast/easy steps of how to do just that!

## Steps

1.  Never wear a miniskirt. A proper lady usually only wears skirts that
    go up to her knees. Going higher may show too much skin and ladies
    don't do that.
2.  If you want to wear shorts make sure they're not too tight or short.
    Make them go to at least a bit lower from where your crotch cuts
    down.
3.  When you wear a shirt it shouldn't go over your tummy. And before
    you try Crop tops do not look good on a lady. It isn't very
    appealing to any man if it is that just means he doesn't want a
    lady.
4.  Shoes are very important to a lady. Shoes really bring a mixed
    colored coordinated outfit together. Don't forget for winter you
    should wear boots, spring high heels, Summer heeled sandals, and
    fall cute sneakers.

## Tips

-   An outfit should look good together and you shouldn't add too many
    things on.

## Warnings

-   Putting too many colors together can make it break your outfit. It's
    best not to get too risky.
