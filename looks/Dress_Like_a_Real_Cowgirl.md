3.  Choose "easy wear", clothes that require no ironing, & are
    washer/dryer proof. Choose fabric that wears well & looks classy, no
    matter what. Select some traveler sheaths..in 1 color, adding
    seasonal appropriate
    jackets.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Cowgirl_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Cowgirl_Step_3.jpg")

    -   Everything in cowboy culture is silver, jewelry, & leather,
        blending with the Native American influence. This never goes out
        of style. You should to have: Jewelry,turquoise, silver, semi
        precious earthy stones, conchos, crosses, pendants in silver,
        the new rusty look is fantastic & more casual.
    -   Concho Belts, or at least well made cowgirl belts. Or, better
        yet, if you know someone in your circle of friends who can tool
        leather. (Or start creating some yourself; you may find you have
        many customers.)
6.  Add conchos to your purse or a “sho-fly” to your zipper. You
    cowgirls know a sho-fly hangs from the breast collar on your horse
    or on the cinch to sho the flies
    away!![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Cowgirl_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Cowgirl_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Put that necklace on! Single strands or multi layered, chunks,
    silver &
    medallions.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Cowgirl_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Cowgirl_Step_7.jpg")
    -   Traditional Classic Shirt: wear a necklace/strands inside the
        collar, one strand of mixed stones or ten strands! This looks
        great. For longer necklaces, wear them outside.

## Tips

-   Necklines: square, boat neck, soft round, v necks, flatter the neck
    & shoulder area moving the eye up and away from the mid section.
-   Wear that shirt outside with a concho belt or tucked inside your
    jeans or skirt.
-   Find your favorite online shoppers guide and look at what trips your
    trigger.
-   We all like the look of expensive jewelry and nice accessories, but
    they can be found without breaking the bank. Do a search and browse
    sites, especially created by ranch ladies deep in the heart of ranch
    county. Be careful not to go too cowgirl cutesy!!! No fabric fringe,
    or Dale Evens (Bless her heart!!) type cowgirl hat....look at real
    cowboys, the way they wear their hats, (it changes depending on what
    part of the country they come from) and rodeo wear is not everyday
    cowgirl wear. Most of what you see in major variety stores are not
    cowgirl.
-   Wear lots of your favorite necklaces, bracelets, and earrings; they
    all do not need to "match." The whole outfit today has to blend and
    have plenty of texture, which comes down to colors & different
    materials.
-   Choose “easy breeze crinkle” shifts for summer, also one color.
-   Get the basic look down, and always go for a good purse with tooling
    and whip stitching. Just add your own conchos, etc. to embellish.
-   Select all leather boots; the look is custom, handmade boots,
    leather all the way. Start with a good basic color and this will be
    exceptionally versatile.
-   Concho Belt: This belt can be worn anyway you can wear it for your
    figure. The look right now is very loose hanging on the lower part
    of your hips, if you can wear it and you like it do it! If you can't
    don't you can look very good in whatever compliment your figure.
    Some cannot wear concho belts because they bring a lot of attention
    to an area most women are not interested in bringing any extra
    attention to.
-   Choose pendants or medallions secured with small “s”
    hooks/attachments made so you can easily attach to any necklace for
    variety of outfits. Also, necklace clasps should preferably be
    simple, easy hooks.
-   Classy but casual also, sometimes just wear a big shirt outside with
    jeans, cowgirl stuff around my neck, bracelets as many as I like, &
    jeans: Roll them "thongs" up a notch or two and enjoy the cooler
    comfort to go shopping or early summer supper somewhere. Grab a
    "punchie" summer tote and "You Go, Girl!
