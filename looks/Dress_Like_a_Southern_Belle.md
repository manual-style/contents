There is almost nothing on this Earth more charming and wholesome than
the thought of 1860s Southern women. Though it isn't possible to go back
in time and be a real-life Southern belle, there are still many groups
in the Southern and Northern United States that reenact the roles of
Southern gentility. All you have to do is find a group, put together a
costume, and begin taking part in the life of the Southern belle.

## Steps

1.  Keep in mind the guidelines of 1860s dress that were very strict. A
    few rules that were *always*
    followed:![](Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_1.jpg")
    -   A lady never showed anything below her collarbone before five
        o'clock PM.
    -   A girl under the age of twenty-one never wore red.
    -   A hat or bonnet was always worn outdoors.
    -   A lady never removed her gloves, even on the dance floor. Eating
        with gloves, however, was considered extremely rude.
    -   Hair was to be kept at the nape of the neck, with the bangs
        pinned back. The only exception, again, was on the dance floor.
    -   Post-style earrings, or any earring besides fishhook-style
        earrings, were not invented.
    -   Sleeves always extended to a lady's wrist, unless of course, she
        was on the dance floor.
    -   Unmarried women never wore feathers in their hair.
2.  Put on a chemise. Though your undergarments don't necessarily have
    to be authentic, a chemise is necessary to keep your corset from
    digging painfully into your skin. An authentic chemise would be
    similar to today's short-sleeved cotton blouse. If you're in a pinch
    for time, don't like the feel of chemises, or simply don't want to
    fork over an extra thirty dollars to be "authentic", you can use a
    short-sleeved white T-shirt or white tank top instead. Remember,
    since you're wearing a corset, you won't need to wear a bra under
    your chemise unless you feel it is absolutely necessary.

3.  Don a corset. To put on a corset, unlace it completely. Then thread
    the string through the bottom pair of holes and make sure an even
    amount of string is on each side. Pull the corset over your head.
    There are many different types of corsets, and many ways to tighten
    yours up. If you have a plain canvas corset with no shape, you can
    lace it in the front. This is to your advantage. If you have a
    custom-made corset, or a corset with boning, you will have to lace
    it in the back. It will probably be helpful to have a friend lace it
    for you. Hold on to a doorframe or bedpost and allow your friend to
    lace up the back, much like you would a
    sneaker.![](Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Tie the corset. To tie it, first tie a plain knot at the top after
    the corset is laced. Press your finger on the knot as hard as you
    can, and have a friend tie the string in a bow as tightly as they
    can. If your corset slips down, you will be constantly annoyed. This
    is why you may also want to safety pin the top and bottom of your
    corset to your
    chemise.![](Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_4.jpg")
    -   Remember, a corset is optional. If you're flatter-chested or
        thinner, you may be able to go without a corset. Simply wear a
        bra and chemise. Keep in mind though, that while this is the
        more comfortable option, a corset will give you a smoother look
        and help keep your posture in check.
5.  Put on your stockings. Any stockings will work, so long as they go
    past the knee. Modern dress stockings from any department store will
    suffice. Pull the stocking as high as it will go. Then, slide a
    garter up your leg until it is about one inch underneath the top of
    the stocking. Fold the top over the garter, and then roll the
    stocking and the garter down to just below your knee. This will keep
    your stockings up throughout the
    day.![](Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_5.jpg")
    -   Many ladies chose to put ankle socks over their stockings to
        avoid blistering. This is up to you.
6.  Put on your pantalettes. Pantalettes are a lady's version of
    pantaloons. They are basically capri-length, very light cotton
    undergarments. Back in the 1860s, all pantalettes had a drawstring
    tie, but many that you will find today will simply have an elastic
    waistband. The more authentic version of pantalettes have no crotch,
    but again, many you find today do have a crotch. Most women also
    choose to wear panties with their pantalettes, although real
    Southern belles did not. Simply pull your pantalettes up to wherever
    you like to pull your jeans to, and tuck your chemise into them. In
    a pinch, or in order to save money, you can simply buy an
    inexpensive pair of capri-length pajama pants to use as
    pantalettes.![](Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Lace up your shoes. The shoes worn at the time would have been an
    unattractive lace-up boot, likely in black or brown. They lace like
    sneakers, but take a large amount of time to put on. If you are
    going only to dance, you may wish to wear anything from white house
    slippers to pink ballet shoes to
    flats.![](Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Tie on your hoop skirt. A hoop skirt may have anywhere from three to
    eight bones (plastic hoops running through the fabric), though the
    typical one Southern belles would have worn would have had six.
    There are many variations on the hoop. Some hoops are covered in
    ruffles or tulle, while others only have thin cotton stretched
    tightly between the bones. Tie your hoop as tightly as possible in
    the front or back, and pin it to your chemise to keep it from
    sliding.![](Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Don your blouse. Simply put it on and button it in either the front
    or back, depending on the style. Remember that Southern belles
    generally wore cotton blouses, similar to the ones often worn today,
    though the patterns and colors may have varied. Don't forget to
    always cover everything from the collarbone and wrists
    up.![](Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_9.jpg")
10. Put on your skirt. Simply pull it over, tuck your blouse in, and
    button. Remember that a lady's hoop would *never* show. Your skirt
    should fall about from the ground, without
    dragging.![](Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_10.jpg")
11. Put on gloves. There are many variations on gloves, and almost no
    set rules. Gloves went to the wrist, and usually had one button or
    no buttons. They could be silk or cotton of almost any color or
    pattern, so long as it complimented a lady's dress. Some gloves had
    fingers, while others did not. Still other gloves were made of
    "fishnet". Some fishnet gloves have fingers, some do not. All of
    these gloves should be readily available to you. Department stores
    should carry plain silk gloves in the winter if this is the easiest
    buy for
    you.![](Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_11.jpg")
12. Style your hair. Hair was almost always worn with the front section
    rolled or braided back, and the rest twisted and pinned in a roll at
    the nape of the neck. Hair was never worn more than two inches or so
    above the
    neck.![](Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_12.jpg")
13. Put on a hat. In the summer, ladies wore Palomino (straw) hats with
    ribbons or flowers that matched their dresses. In the winter, ladies
    wore bonnets made of thicker material. Straw bonnets may also be
    worn in the summer. A lady is never outside without a hat on, or
    inside with a hat on, unless she happens to be in church.
    ![](Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_13.jpg")
14. Have good posture, a warm smile, and an open heart to being a
    Southern
    belle!![](Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Southern_Belle_Step_14.jpg")

## Tips

-   Wear light makeup. A bit of foundation, a thin layer of mascara, and
    a touch of lipstick or Chapstick is the *most* you should ever be
    wearing at a time.
-   Be wary of your posture. Nothings looks less ladylike than
    slouching!
-   Always keep a handkerchief with you. Not only is it more accurate,
    but it will serve you many purposes!
-   Beware of "popping" safety pins. When a safety pin pops, it comes
    open and may stab you multiple times.
