Surfer girl style is known to be relaxed, effortless, and full of
interesting style combinations.[1] Dressing like a surfer girl is often
popular in warm climates, where you can rock cool prints and swimsuits
all year long. You can get the surfer girl look by looking for surfer
girl style clothing at clothing shops and thrift stores, by styling your
hair to get the beachy look, and by doing your makeup so you look
perfectly sun kissed.

## Steps

### Choosing Surfer Girl Clothing

1.  Mix and match your bikinis. Bikinis and swimwear are key elements to
    any surfer girl style, from bandeau style tops and boy shorts to
    more sexy, strappy two pieces. But you can really kick your surfer
    girl style up a level by mixing and matching your bikinis so you are
    wearing a more neutrally colored top piece and a bright, printed
    bottom
    piece.[2]![](Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_1.jpg")
    -   Don’t be afraid to have fun with the mix and match approach,
        especially when it comes to mixing prints. Surfer girls are
        known for their unique approach to mixing patterns and prints
        and are often always wearing colorful swimwear as they ride a
        wave or hang out on the beach.
    -   You can top off the mix and match bikini with a long unbuttoned
        denim shirt and denim shorts for a relaxed day look or wear a
        light summer dress over your bikini for a night out.
2.  Look for surfer gear like rash guards and surfer logo t-shirts. If
    you are planning to really embrace the surfer girl lifestyle, you
    may decide to take up surfing and wear surfer gear like rash guards,
    surfer logo t-shirts, and even wet suits. This would create an
    authentic look that is also practical and useful as a
    surfer.![](Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_2.jpg")
    -   You can find surfer gear at your local surf shop or online surf
        shops.
3.  Combine vintage pieces with new items. Head to your closest vintage
    store or thrift store and look for 60s style tops and vintage band
    t-shirts. You can then combine these pieces with new items like
    jeans, shorts, and skirts from the mall. The idea is to look put
    together but also effortless and unique, with an emphasis on vintage
    or distressed
    clothing.[3]![](Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_3.jpg")
    -   You can also look for cozy sweaters and chunky knits at the
        thrift store or the mall, a good look for colder nights on the
        beach. You can then pair a cozy sweater with jeans or shorts for
        a relaxed, surfer girl look.
4.  Wear bold graphics and prints. Surfer girls are known for their love
    of color, graphics, and prints, so embrace their bold style and look
    for tops in bright floral prints and colorful patterns. You can also
    wear dresses in fun prints of animals, seascapes, or even
    surfboards. Keep your look fun and colorful with graphics that are
    sure to get some attention on the
    beach.[4]![](Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_4.jpg")
    -   You can also combine a bold graphic t-shirt with jeans or shorts
        or wear a floral print top with a brightly colored bottom. Don’t
        be afraid to wear lots of color and if you decide to wear black,
        jazz it up with a brightly colored sweater or bold accessories.
5.  Go for strappy sandals and ankle boots. Surfer girls spend lots of
    time on the beach so they are often seen wearing flip flops,
    Birkenstock sandals, or strappy sandals. You can also wear strappy
    sandals for a night out, pairing them with a long floral skirt and a
    neutral top or a long flowy dress in a bold
    print.[5]![](Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_5.jpg")
    -   Ankle boots in brown or burgundy can also be a fun way to dress
        up an outfit and give it a bit of edge, especially if you are
        wearing a lot of flowy floral items. Combat boots with laces can
        also be a good option as an alternative to sandals for when the
        weather gets cold at night.
6.  Accessorize with earrings, long necklaces, hats, and sunglasses.
    With surfer girls, the mantra is the more accessories, the better.
    Go for long, dangly earrings with precious stones like turquoise, or
    simple studs in gold or silver. Long necklaces with charms and
    pendants are also a fun way to complete a beachy look. Chokers,
    usually in black, are also popular with surfer girls to add some
    edge to an
    outfit.[6]![](Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_6.jpg")
    -   Wide brim hats are also popular with surfer girls, often made of
        felt or cotton. No surfer girl look would be complete without
        sunglasses, usually in an aviator style or with thick, colorful
        frames.
7.  Pair dressy pants or a skirt with a casual top for a night out. If
    you are looking to emulate the surfer girl look off the beach and on
    the town, you could pair a dressy pair of dark pants or a long print
    skirt with a casual top like a t-shirt or a decorative blouse. You
    could then finish the look with dressy sandals or boots with a
    heel.![](Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_7.jpg")
    -   You can also make the surfer girl look appear more dressy by
        wearing accessories like long necklaces or earrings to jazz up a
        more casual outfit.

### Styling Your Hair

1.  Get the beachy long hair look. One of the most popular hairstyles
    for surfer girls is the beachy, messy look, usually done with long
    hair. You can add a swoop to one side to really make your hair look
    effortless and
    relaxed.[7]![](Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_8.jpg")
    -   Begin with damp hair, perhaps right after a shower. Form a
        rectangle with your hair at the front of your head. The
        rectangle should extend from the end of one eyebrow to the end
        of the other eyebrow and four inches back from your hairline.
    -   Spray a volumizer spray on the roots of your hair. Use a round
        brush to blow-dry your hair straight up to create a tousled
        look.
    -   Once your hair is dry, twist the rectangle section around three
        fingers so it forms a pin curl and pin it with a bobby pin.
        Allow the section to cool as you spray salt spray on the rest of
        your hair and tousle it with your fingers to get a beachy look.
    -   Unpin the pin curl and apply dry shampoo to the roots of the
        rectangle section. Then, flip most of the section to one side
        and form a side part that begins at the arch of your eyebrow and
        angles back towards the crown of your head. You should have one
        big swoop on one side and a small swoop on the other side.
2.  Put your hair up in a messy top knot. This is a popular style for
    surfer girls because it’s easy to do with ocean wet hair and shows
    off your
    tan.[8]![](Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Use damp hair or apply two dollops of styling mousse to dry air.
        Apply the mousse from the roots to the end of your dry hair so
        it is easier to style.
    -   Flip your hair over and use a blow dryer to roughly blow it out
        using your fingers. Make sure there are no stiff pieces and the
        mousse is dry. If your hair is damp, you can skip this step.
    -   While still upside down, gather your hair together in a ponytail
        at the top of your head. Secure the ponytail with a hair tie and
        flip your head back up. Split the ponytail into two sections and
        twist each section until they twist together. Secure the hair at
        the base of your ponytail with bobby pins.
    -   Spray the top knot with salt spray, tousling it with your
        fingers for a messy look.
3.  Try a long side braid. The relaxed side braid is a good option for a
    night out where you still want to rock a surfer girl vibe. You can
    do the long side braid with medium to long length
    hair.![](Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Begin with damp hair and apply a leave in conditioner so your
        hair is shiny and ready for styling. Then, gather up your hair
        so it is on one side of your head.[9]
    -   Braid your hair, moving from the middle section of your hair
        down to one side of your head. Keep the braid fairly tight for
        now, securing it with a hair tie.
    -   Use your fingers to mess up the braid a little, gently tugging
        on parts of the braid so it looks messy but remains secure.
        Finish with hairspray so the braid stays put all night long.

### Doing Your Make Up

1.  Keep your eye and lip make up minimal. Most surfer girls are too
    busy riding waves to apply layers of eye make up, so don’t over do
    it with your make up. Go for waterproof mascara and a light, warm
    shade of eyeshadow to compliment your sunkissed look. Finish the
    look with lip gloss or lip tint in a warm pink
    hue.[10]![](Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_11.jpg")
    -   You can apply a more bold eye make up look for going out at
        night by applying a thin layer of eyeliner and glittery eye
        shadow. You can finish the night out look with a darker
        lipstick.
2.  Apply bronzer on your cheekbones for a sunkissed look. One of the
    major make up elements of the surfer girl look is bronzed, tanned
    skin. You can make your face appear more sunkissed by using bronzing
    powder.[11]![](Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Apply bronzing powder with a big make up brush, swiping some on
        your hairline, temples, chin, and jawline. You can also apply it
        under your cheekbones by making small circles with the brush.
        You can then apply bronzer to the areas on your neck and chest
        that tend to get hit by the sun, including your collarbones,
        your shoulders, and your shins.
3.  Use self tanner or spend some time in the sun. When you dress like a
    surfer girl, you should try to always have a nice, even tan. You
    could apply self-tanner to your body or spend more time in the sun
    to get a tan the natural
    way.[12]![](Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Always wear sunscreen when you are outside in the sun or make
        sure your tinted moisturizer contains SPF.
