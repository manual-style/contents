footballer.[1] Some view WAGs as one of the most stylish people on
earth. Think Victoria Beckham, Coleen Rooney, Alex Curran they are now
your new role models!

## Steps

1.  Remember even girls on a budget can get the WAG look! If you have
    the dedication you can look like a WAG if you follow these simple
    steps! Being a WAG is all about being on top form all the time. Even
    when its the wrong time of the month, or you have a cold, always
    looking like the epitome of health and
    beauty.![](Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  The first step to looking like a WAG is confidence, believe that you
    are beautiful and deserve all eyes on you at all
    times!![](Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  So take care of yourself because you are worth
    it.![](Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Get a tropical tan, you can rub on the fake stuff, hit the sun beds
    (responsibly) or book a flight somewhere hot. A good way to maintain
    your tan is with a boosting moisturiser, they have a little bit of
    fake tan in it and keep that summer glow all year round. Its
    important to exfoliate to keep the tan even and your skin looking
    fresh and
    healthy.![](Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Make sure your hair is always in tip top condition. Get a trim every
    six to eight weeks to keep split ends at bay. WAGs are well known
    for their long luxurious hair so if your hair is a little on the
    short side, your best bet is extensions. You can get these done
    professionally at most salons, or get clip in's from places like
    Boots, Superdrug or most Afro hair
    shops.![](Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Make sure your make up is always done get up an hour early if you
    have to. No one should see you without your make up on, even if your
    popping round to the corner shop at 7.30am. It ruins the illusion of
    perfection. Keep make up simple and fresh, foundation, concealer and
    powder. Add a dash of hi lighter to your cheek bones and few coats
    of mascara and sweep of lip gloss. You can add to this in the
    evening building up a smokey eyed look with a bit of bronzer to the
    cheeks.![](Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_6.jpg")
7.  No matter what you're doing you should always be dressed to impress.
    It is important that you dress for the occasion, however to make
    sure you stand out from the crowd always go one step further than
    expected. For instance hanging around at home, instead of grimy
    pyjamas and tatty slippers: a velour tracksuit, push up bra, tight
    tank top, shiny watch and earrings and some Uggs. And of course your
    full face and your hair straightened and
    fluffed.![](Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
8.  You don't have to have a designer wardrobe to look classy. Invest in
    statement pieces. You don't have to go out and buy a whole new
    wardrobe, after all Rome wasn't built in a day. WAG style is simple
    and elegant with a flashy twist. Skinny jeans, a white T and a pair
    of heels will never fail to turn heads. Following trends are
    important, try to keep your eyes open in the Mags and media so you
    can be the first to master it. Once again you don't need to rush out
    and buy it all, most of the staples can be found lurking at the back
    of your wardrobe. A few key pieces will spruce up your
    look!![](Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
9.  Its also important to keep your clothes in good condition. Never
    wear something twice without washing it, use fabric conditioner, and
    iron everything. Even your
    knickers.![](Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
10. Accessorize! If you can invest in things such as a designer
    watch/scarf/jewelry/shoes/sunglasses/handbags. If you can't stretch
    your budget that far, not to worry, the high street has bang on
    trend options at affordable prices. Never leave the house without
    accessories. They finish the outfit and make you look
    polished.![](Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
11. High Heels are essential. So if you are as graceful as a clown in
    heels, then get practicing. The age old book on the head. First
    master it without heels on, then once you feel comfortable with
    that, try it with your heels on. Always walk tall and hold your head
    up
    high.![](Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
12. Being a WAG is high maintenance. You need to make sure your legs are
    always smooth, your nails are painted, skin moisturised, teeth are
    clean. You could even try extra hard and get a manicure/facial/wax
    or get your teeth bleached. Being a WAG is all about looking your
    best.![](Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
13. Good Luck, who knows you may even bag yourself a
    Footballer![](Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Wag_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")
