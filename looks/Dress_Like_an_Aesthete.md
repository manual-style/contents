Have you ever seen
[preraphaelite](Look_Like_a_Pre_Raphaelite_Maiden "wikilink") paintings
and were awed by the beautiful clothing? In the 1890s there was a
movement against the heavily corseted and industrialized fashion common
to [the period](Dress_Modern_Victorian "wikilink"). The people who were
part of this movement were the aesthetes. If you would like to dress
like them, read on...

## Steps

1.  Find an aesthete who inspires you. It is not important if it is an
    author in the decadence movement or an anonymous woman in a
    pre-Raphaelite painting as long as it makes you think "what would
    this person have found beautiful? how could I epitomize that?" Those
    questions will help you begin your journey towards an aesthete
    appearance.![](Dress_Like_an_Aesthete_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_an_Aesthete_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Develop an aesthete wardrobe. Do some research and find your
    favorite styles and cuts. Some common characteristics of aesthete
    clothing are:
    -   Wear fabrics of velvet, silk or wool in natural dyes of jewel
        tones, black, warm yellows and creams.
    -   loose dresses or Turkish trousers and loose
        shirts![](Dress_Like_an_Aesthete_Step_2Bullet2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_an_Aesthete_Step_2Bullet2.jpg")
    -   Jackets to keep warm. Jackets should be loose and hip to ankle
        length with no lapels or lapels curved and no more stiff than
        the rest of the jacket.
    -   Wear popular brands for aesthetes that are still in business
        today such as Liberty and Co and Morris and Co.
    -   Free embroidery is good for decorations, but remember that it
        was used minimally.
    -   Smocking was also popular.
3.  Get Aesthete hair. Aesthete women often had hair as long as their
    hips and thighs, and men had slightly longer hair than an average
    Victorian man. No matter what color or length your hair is, wear it
    loose and down. Avoid heat styling and gels. Aesthete women often
    wore daisies in their
    hair.![](Dress_Like_an_Aesthete_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_an_Aesthete_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Wear flat shoes. A good modern equivalent to aesthete shoes would be
    ballet flats and for men a simple flat oxfords. The best colors for
    aesthete shoes are black, jewel tones, cream and yellow with an
    orange
    tint.![](Dress_Like_an_Aesthete_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_an_Aesthete_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Add a personal touch. Think of your favorite flowers and soft
    decadent patterns, do a bit of online searching and add them to your
    outfit. For example, paisley and tiny flower patterns are still
    popular today, and can add a bit of eccentricity to a beautiful
    dress.![](Dress_Like_an_Aesthete_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_an_Aesthete_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Read up on medieval times, the regency and other pre-industrial
    ages. The aesthetes were charmed by the ways of the past, and even
    though now the aesthetes are the past too it is helpful to know how
    they got their
    ideas.![](Dress_Like_an_Aesthete_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_an_Aesthete_Step_6.jpg")

## Tips

-   Learn about the art of the late 19th century. Not only does it help
    you seem more cultured, it can give you inspiration for your next
    outfit!
-   Look at the styles of the regency and medieval eras for influence.
-   Many aesthetes were the earliest form of vegetarians, so cutting
    down on meat every once in a while helps you get a feel of how they
    lived.
-   Aesthetes wore more makeup, but if you enjoy makeup keep it
    [natural](Become_a_Natural_Beauty "wikilink").
-   Reading books associated with decadence in the 1890s is great to add
    an air of aesthete charm. For example, the yellow book, Charles
    Baudelaire and Oscar Wilde.
-   If you want to be really authentic you could
    [handsew](Hem_Clothing_by_Hand "wikilink") or use an
    [antique](Buy_Antiques "wikilink") sewing machine.

## Warnings

-   Avoid any stiff undergarments. The aesthetes were rebelling against
    courtesy but as most women don't wear corsets anymore, a good
    equivalent would be wearing a sports fun or bralette or at least one
    without padding. Shapewear is also another thing to avoid.
