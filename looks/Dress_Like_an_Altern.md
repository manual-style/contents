What's that? You've not heard of Altern? Well, let me fill your mind
with stylish knowledge...The Altern Kids are a new subculture that has
started in the UK in the beginning of 2k16. This style piles up goth,
punk, and hippie, squashes it together, and adds a sprinkle of a
futuristic touch.Here is my handy guide on how to dress like an Altern
Kid.

## Steps

1.  Get The Trousers. The trousers that are usually worn by Altern Kids
    are Harem Pants that have patterns on them, stripes, spots, paisley,
    or otherwise. They are baggy and are worn to blow in the wind. This
    is where the 1960s Hippie vibe comes in. It is easiest to buy them
    online, but if you want to go for the fully authentic look then pick
    some up whilst travelling in Thailand or India.
2.  T-shirts. The best t-shirts you can get are tie dye or acid wash
    tops, usually in one or two colours, but don't be afraid to throw in
    some rainbow colours! You can't really go wrong with the colours, no
    matter what anyone says. They should be baggy and if you like should
    have a granddad-top collar. Don't be afraid to rip your shirts and
    customise them.
3.  A waistcoat is a must. This combines the laid back look with a smart
    and stylish dash. Go straight from designer cotton all the way to
    biker leather. Put pin badges on them with band logos and altern
    slogans.
4.  Accessorize like mad. This is where the Punk and Goth influences
    come in. Get yourself a headband on bandanna, and tie it round your
    forehead like a pirate. Round reflective sunglasses are the pinacle
    of an Altern Kid. Get them in psychadelic colours. Wristbands of all
    kinds are also welcome, from studded to string-and-bead. Get
    yourself a spiked choker, and let it hang round your neck, or some
    beads in an autumnal colour.
5.  Hair is everything. Cut it or grow it, dye it the craziest colour
    you can, and go completely mind-meltingly nuts. Bleached spikes,
    pink scene-cuts, and pastel-purple mohicans are a way to go to town.
    Shave in your crushes name into the back, give your hair lepoard
    spots, and completely lose yourself in the world of bizzare hair.Â
    Make sure you keep your hair clean and nourished, and remember that
    shampoo isn't a dirty word.
6.  If you don't want to dye your hair, a hat is a good alternative. Get
    a fedora or a beret or a panama and wear it in and outdoors (same
    for the sunglasses).
7.  The Altern subculture takes it's roots from bands like My Chemical
    Romance, Sex Pistols, The Cure, and even old stuff like The Beatles
    and Janis Joplin. Mix your music taste up completely and get a real
    idea of what you're mixing together.
8.  And there you go! Enjoy dressing as an Altern Kid, have a laugh with
    your mates, listen to some awesome tunes, and above all have fun!

## Tips

-   Don't be afraid to mix your style up. When you walk downstairs and
    your mum says 'You know that top doesn't match those trousers' then
    you'll know you've made it!
-   Really get into the music, this will help you to get more ideas for
    outfits.

## Warnings

-   Be prepared to get stares out on the streets. People may even
    approach you and make fun, but never let it get you down.
-   Remember, just because you're an Altern Kid it doesn't mean you're
    any better than anyone else. Don't try to change anyone else's style
    or tell them they're doing it wrong.
