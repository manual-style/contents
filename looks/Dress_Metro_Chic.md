Models are the epitome of metro chic. Although looking like a twig
doesn't have many perks (I should know!), looking metro does, as it
conjures up an image of a very *couture* individual.

## Steps

1.  Dark, sold, metro. Dark tees with no patterns, dark jeans with no
    faded spots, and dark high-top sneakers. It’s essential! Good colors
    are heather grey, black, chocolate brown, navy and mute grey. Avoid
    wearing too many bright colors at once; the occasional pop of red or
    metallic is a guaranteed way to catch the attention of any and
    everyone.![](Dress_Metro_Chic_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Metro_Chic_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Buy tops that are a bit baggier. This doesn’t mean rocking the
    down-to-your-knees, gang-banger look around town, but perhaps going
    up a size when buying tee-shirts. Even when buying leather jackets,
    hoodies, cardigans and other outerwear should be looser than usual.
    It looks very metro, very… Natasha

3.  Stay in fashion. Skinny jeans, jeggings, leggings and leather pants.
    Fine: fitted bottoms look so absolutely… Freja Beha Erichsen, who,
    coincidentally has one of the best pair of legs in the business.
    BUT. Be careful if you don’t like the way you look in tighter pants,
    the lack of confidence will make you seem awkward in
    them!![](Dress_Metro_Chic_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Metro_Chic_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Your toes need to be completely encased in glamour. This means
    knee-high leather boots with a stiletto heel, high-top black
    sneakers, ankle booties, and retro biker boots. Mainly, anything
    that makes you feel refreshingly Chanel

5.  Run your fingers through your hair, stand in front of a fan, get up
    and go; do what you MUST to achieve the perfect tousled locks.
    Anyone who’s anyone sports them: Kate Moss, Irina Shayk. Don’t you
    want to be someone, too? Make sure your hair is always clean,
    though, and never frizzy or damaged. Trim the ends every 2 weeks. If
    you have long hair, many times you’ll want to limit yourself to 10
    minutes of
    curl-prepping.![](Dress_Metro_Chic_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Metro_Chic_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Don’t cake it on. Take lengthening mascara and swoop it on. Take the
    peach blush and dash it on ONCE. Chapstick should be enough; heck,
    it IS enough. Keep it beachy but also grungy, as if you couldn’t
    care less. But you do, so never
    mind.![](Dress_Metro_Chic_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Metro_Chic_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Look at pictures of mind-blowing models such as Lily Donaldson,
    Freja Beha, Karolina Kurkova, Jessica Stam and, even though she’s
    NOT a model, she carries herself like one nowadays, Ashlee Simpson.
    Yes, it’s true. Note the bags, and makeup details, and anything that
    catches your
    eye.![](Dress_Metro_Chic_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Metro_Chic_Step_7.jpg")

## Tips

-   Always look in the mirror before you leave the house, and take off
    one accessory before doing so. Make your best about-face and strut
    into the city to dominate the airwaves.
-   Love the skin you're in! I'm 5'7, 100 pounds and not many things
    look good on me. That pretty much *PROVES* that the model physique
    is horrible! So love the skin you're in, whether you're 5'3 and 145
    pounds or 5'7 and (begrudgingly) 100 pounds!
