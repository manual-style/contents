Have lots of different types of clothes? Think they're mismatched? Read
this article to see if you can match them and look cute!

## Steps

### Tops/T-shirts

1.  Wear lots of layers, plain colour underneath but bright or pastel,
    and have your top T-shirt have a pattern, like stripes.
2.  Choose a jacket that matches any of the t-shirts/ jumpers you are
    wearing.

### Bottoms

1.  With jeans and denim, they will go with almost anything, so its good
    to have 1 item of denim.
2.  With leggings, have them tight and well-fitting, perhaps leopard
    print
3.  With anything that has patterns, match big with small. ex. one top
    with a big pattern with a skirt that has a small detailed pattern

### Accessories

1.  DO NOT OVER ACCESSORISE
2.  Long flowing scarves are good. Flowery or leopard print are
    recommended with a plain or graphic shirt.
3.  Try plainer shoes like Converse
4.  Plain hats

## Tips

-   ask a friend to come over and see if your outfit works

## Warnings

-   Don't just have random colours
