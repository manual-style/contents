Here's how to look like a modern Queen Vic!

## Steps

1.  Try some accessories. You could buy a necklace with a locket on it,
    or cameo. Also earrings, large or small, give you the Victorian look
    you'll be looking for. But with the earrings, don't overdo it,
    simple is always more. Gold and "rustic" jewelry are
    best.![](Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Shop in antique and thrift stores. These stores are the best to get
    cheap and classic looking pieces that are timeless. These stores are
    also good to get shirts from, it will be easier to get the classic
    look you will be looking for. But you can always go to small
    boutiques and get these
    pieces.![](Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Incorporate some Victorian colours in to your wardrobe such as deep
    purple and turquoise, light pinks, whites, off whites, and navy blue
    are all good. Also try to add some ruffles, small pearl-looking
    beads on tops/blazers, etc. For shoes, anything simple and elegant
    will work fine. High wasted skirts are also very classy, and
    Victorian paired with a tucked-in shirt with large flowers;
    perfect.![](Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Wear cardigans often; they are going to be your new best friend. You
    can get them in any color and it will look great. Creams, navy blue,
    grays and black are all great color choices. Also, you can get knit,
    which is a great choice for any piece of
    clothing.![](Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Find jackets that hit your mid-thigh for cold weather. Pea coats
    with nice scarves are good as well, along with black mittens, and
    boots that are either ankle cut, or
    high.![](Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Carry a small over the shoulder handbag, possibly a Victorian
    colour, or with flowers on it. The bigger the better, big flowers
    are always better too. Browns, blacks, and grays are good color
    choices for the "background"
    colors.![](Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Wear your hair in any way that is comfortable to you. short and wavy
    or short and straight. With longer hair you can put it up in a messy
    bun, with your bangs in a bump, low ponytail, curls--anything really
    looks good. I would have to go against having your hair straight all
    the time, once in a while is fine, but all the time, is too much of
    a modern
    look.![](Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Finding what you want to capture this endless look shouldn't be
    hard. Today's modern "high fashion look" has lots of these
    characters.![](Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Remember, don't overdo it. Less is
    more.![](Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Victorian_Step_9.jpg")

## Tips

-   Remember, less is more. You can achieve this look with simple pieces
    along with one piece that is extremely Victorian, but modern it up
    with a high black wasted skirt to down play it.
-   Once you start dressing like this, you may get looks. But don't
    worry, they are just admiring your new look.
