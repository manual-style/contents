Modern vintage is a fashion trend that blends vintage-styled clothing
with high-street clothing. Bold prints, high waist bottoms, and collared
shirts are all part of what makes this modern look vintage inspired.
Achieving a modern vintage look can seem overwhelming if you don’t know
where to begin, but with a few staple vintage pieces paired with items
already found in your closet, you will become a modern vintage guru in
no time.

## Steps

### Choosing Garments and Accessories

1.  Gravitate toward plain white or colorful printed blouses. A plain
    white-cotton blouse is an essential piece to a modern vintage
    wardrobe. It is basic enough to be dressed up or dressed down,
    depending on your mood and environment. Conversely, blouses with
    loud prints make great vintage statement pieces, but only if you
    have enough plain modern clothing to tone the prints
    down.[1]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Layer simple white vintage blouses with colorful modern
        cardigans, or take that bold vintage print and tone it down with
        a solid-colored jacket.[2]
2.  Choose high-waist pants and shorts over low-rise bottoms. High-waist
    bottoms add a vintage signature to any outfit. The cut is often very
    flattering on any body type because it elongates the hips and waist,
    and can be paired with just about any modern or vintage
    top.[3]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Pair high-waist shorts or pants with a simple white collared
        blouse to create an effortless day-look.[4]
3.  Look for high-waist swing skirts and shirt-waist dresses for a more
    feminine feel. When picking out dresses and skirts, try and find
    ones that will fall around your ankle or calf, and that sit high on
    your waist. This style was very popular in the 1940s and 1950s, and
    will be easy to dress up or dress down with modern
    accessories.[5]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Swing skirts can easily be paired with a printed T-shirt, and
        shirt-waist dresses look great when layered with a modern
        cardigan or leather jacket.[6]
4.  Slip on heels with rounded toes or basic laced shoes. Many modern
    shoes have little vintage-inspired accents. Heels with rounded toes
    and shoes with white laces are reminiscent of vintage looks. Putting
    on a pair of these, or even leather loafers, will add both modern
    and vintage touches to an
    outfit.[7]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Colorful heels with a rounded toe can easily modernize a vintage
        dress or skirt. Pair it with accessories that match the heels to
        further tie together the look.[8]
    -   Strap on some sandals with your high-waist shorts and a printed
        T-shirt for a great summertime look.[9]
5.  Get a mixture of vintage and modern jewelry. Pearls and golden or
    rustic-looking lockets are great vintage accessories to have. Most
    likely, however, you are going to need more modern accessories than
    vintage to help bring modern accents into an outfit. Your modern
    jewelry should help accentuate a specific color within the vintage
    piece you are
    wearing.[10]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Edgy geometric necklaces, earrings, or bracelets will add modern
        touches to any vintage outfit.[11]

### Assembling the Modern Vintage Look

1.  Pick one dramatic or whimsical vintage piece to dress around. Using
    multiple loud vintage pieces can easily drown out any contemporary
    items you add. Keep in mind that you want to blend vintage and
    modern for the
    outfit.[12]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_6_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_6_Version_3.jpg")
    -   So if you want to wear that faux-leopard coat that has been
        hanging in your closet, then pair it with simple black clothes
        and accessories to help balance the outfit.[13]
    -   Adding denim to any bold vintage item will automatically ground
        the outfit and make it look contemporary. So if you stumble
        across a vintage colorful blouse or sweater, and you don’t know
        what modern piece to pair it with, then just add a denim skirt,
        a pair of jeans, or a denim jacket to tone down the vintage
        piece.[14]
2.  Blend items from different decades. This is perhaps the easiest way
    to make your vintage pieces look current. Sticking to one decade for
    inspiration will limit your options
    drastically.[15]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_7_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_7_Version_3.jpg")
    -   So instead of focusing your efforts on re-creating a swing-look
        from the 1940s or 1950s, pair that high waist swing skirt with a
        rocking T-shirt or leather jacket from the 1970s.[16]
3.  Spruce up era-specific outfits with contrasting colors and textiles.
    If your goal is to wear a vintage outfit from one specific era, then
    try modernizing it with pops of color or contrasting textiles. These
    additions will take an era-specific outfit and make it seem more
    intentionally
    contemporary.[17]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_8_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_8_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Try pairing that shirt-waist dress with popping colored heels or
        leather sandals, and flouncy hat.[18]
4.  Mix vintage pieces with modern staples. If you are just starting to
    build your modern vintage wardrobe, then perhaps the best place to
    start is by looking in your closet to see what modern staple pieces
    you own. Jeans, plain pencil skirts, cardigans, button-up tops, and
    spaghetti strapped shirts, are just a few modern staples that will
    contemporize a lot of the vintage clothing you
    find.[19]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_9_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_9_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Take your plain pencil skirt, and pair it with a colorful floral
        1980s blouse to create a statement office look.[20]
    -   If you want to wear that fancy white Edwardian blouse, then pair
        it with a simple zip-up sweatshirt and jeans, or high waist
        shorts and modern patterned tights. This will help downplay the
        blouse and still maintain its vintage appeal.[21]
5.  Layer contrasting vintage items to modernize them. Sometimes adding
    layers to a look can lift an outfit from one decade and drop it in
    another. Layering items will encourage you to experiment with
    pairing items from different decades to create a modern vintage look
    that best represents
    you.[22]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_10_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_10_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Maybe think about layering that over-sized vintage sweater with
        a collared-blouse. Add a pair of fitted dark wash jeans or
        skirt, and you now have a modern vintage daytime look.[23]
6.  Separate vintage suits and create multiple outfits. If you are
    shopping at a thrift store, then you are most likely going to come
    across a variety of vintage suits. While these may look dated,
    separating the suit pieces and pairing them with contemporary
    blouses or denim bottoms can easily create a lively modern vintage
    look.[24]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_11.jpg")
    -   Vintage formal attire can often include loud or multicolored
        prints, so try pairing those pieces with modern casual pieces to
        help tone the outfit down.[25]
7.  Pair the outfit with modern accessories. Accentuating your vintage
    clothing with modern accessories is a great way to ground the outfit
    and keep it from looking like a costume. Use modern-styled bags,
    sunglasses, and shoes like high heels, chunky sandals, or Oxford
    styles, to pull the vintage look into contemporary
    times.[26]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Try picking a color that is central to a vintage piece you are
        wearing, and use modern accessories to bring out that color.
        This will help tie in the vintage with the modern, and make the
        overall outfit look more cohesive.[27]
    -   If your outfit already has a lot of color in it, then
        contemporize the look with black accessories.[28]
8.  Keep experimenting and refer to vintage photos for inspiration. Once
    you have collected a few vintage pieces, have fun experimenting with
    different modern vintage looks. If you need more inspiration, then
    you can always turn to old photos and magazines to see how different
    items can be paired.[29]

### Finding Vintage Clothing

1.  Look for vintage clothing at your local thrift store. Thrift stores
    are great places to find vintage clothing at a bargain price. You
    may have to sift through dozens of piles, but if you find that
    golden item without emptying your wallet, it will be well worth the
    effort.[30]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_14.jpg")
    -   If you are having trouble finding vintage pieces that go with
        your aesthetic, then try to also look at the vintage clothing
        from a DIY perspective. Just because a vintage dress or shirt is
        oversized or shapeless, does not mean you can’t get creative and
        pair the item with a modern belt, or trim the item to fit your
        size and aesthetic.[31]
    -   Sometimes adding or swapping out drab buttons on a blouse or
        dress can liven up the item and modernize it.[32]
2.  Check local departments store for vintage-inspired styles. You might
    not have to go to a specialized vintage shop to find vintage-looking
    clothing. Current designers often mimic old styles. A blend of these
    styles can often be seen in full swing dress skirts, shirt-waist
    dresses, halter-top dresses, and layered flapper-style
    dresses.[33]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_15.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_15.jpg")
    -   New clothes that are vintage inspired will also often be
        available in more sizes, and will be more affordable than
        genuine vintage clothing.[34]
3.  Shop at specialized vintage stores either online or in person. There
    are stores that specialize in genuine vintage clothing. So if you
    are hunting for a specific piece, and are having no luck finding it
    at thrift shops or department stores, then try looking at vintage
    boutiques. Just know that genuine vintage clothing can be
    pricey.[35]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_16.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_16.jpg")

### Styling Your Hair and Makeup

1.  Add layers to short hair to create an edgy-looking bob. If you are
    looking to convey a hairstyle from the 1920s and you have short
    hair, then try for a modernly styled bob. Bobs were very popular
    hairstyles in the 1920s, but instead of cutting it bluntly, add some
    layers to modernize the
    look.[36]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_17.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_17.jpg")
2.  Tousle long hair to create beach waves. Loose, wavy, long hair was
    very popular in the 1940s, and can easily translate into a
    contemporary hairstyle. So if you want to maintain your long locks,
    then just add some volumizer or curling cream to give your hair some
    vintage-looking
    dimension.[37]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_18.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_18.jpg")
3.  Style your hair in a top-knot or ballerina bun. If you want to have
    an up-do with your modern vintage look, then test out some of the
    more contemporary hairstyles. A simple
    [top-knot](Make_a_Top_Knot_Bun "wikilink") or sleek ballerina bun
    will help to modernize your overall look, and also give it
    elegance.[38]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_19.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_19.jpg")
4.  Keep your makeup contemporary. You are going to want to ground your
    vintage look with modern accents. Using modern smokey eyes for an
    evening look, or [natural
    makeup](Apply_Makeup_for_a_Natural_Look "wikilink") for a daytime
    look, is an easy way to accomplish
    this.[39]![](Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_20.jpg "fig:Dress_Modern_Vintage_Step_20.jpg")
