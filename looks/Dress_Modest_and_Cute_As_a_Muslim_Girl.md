Finding it hard to stay modest and be cute at the same time? Well, no
fear - help is here! This article is for Muslim girls who are trying to
dress modest and cute! Read on to find out more.

## Steps

1.  Learn the awrah. The awrah for a Muslim girl in front of her
    Mahrams, infants and other women is from her navel to her knees. The
    awrah for a Muslim girl in front of non Mahram men is her whole body
    except from her hands and
    face.![](Dress_Modest_and_Cute_As_a_Muslim_Girl_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Modest_and_Cute_As_a_Muslim_Girl_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Get the right pants/jeans. It is suggested that you get boot-cut
    style pants and for jeans, get straight leg or flare leg. Make sure
    that they are loose and go below your ankle. Don't ever get
    shorts!![](Dress_Modest_and_Cute_As_a_Muslim_Girl_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Modest_and_Cute_As_a_Muslim_Girl_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Get the right tops. Always keep a loose, long sleeved hoodie in your
    wardrobe - they can definitely come in handy whenever you're around
    non Mahram men! Also, an easy thing to do is to get short sleeved
    tees and then, if you are going to be present in front of a
    non-Mahram, put your hoodie on top of it! Just make sure the hoodie
    is loose! You can also get cardigans too, for a more girly look -
    just as long as they are loose! Tunics are great, too, as long they
    are loose and long enough. But somethings can be too long, shirts
    shouldn't go past mid thigh if you are looking for a cute look. Tank
    tops can be worn with a cute cardigan added
    on.![](Dress_Modest_and_Cute_As_a_Muslim_Girl_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Modest_and_Cute_As_a_Muslim_Girl_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Get long skirts and dresses. They may sound extremely ugly but if
    you pull it off, it looks absolutely stunning! Ensure that they are
    not see through and aren't
    tight!![](Dress_Modest_and_Cute_As_a_Muslim_Girl_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Modest_and_Cute_As_a_Muslim_Girl_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Get the perfect shoes! For a casual look, get sneakers. For a both
    casual and dressy look, get ballet flats, for a classy casual or
    business look, get high
    heels!![](Dress_Modest_and_Cute_As_a_Muslim_Girl_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Modest_and_Cute_As_a_Muslim_Girl_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Get trench coats too for those cold days! They are totally modest
    and
    cute!![](Dress_Modest_and_Cute_As_a_Muslim_Girl_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Modest_and_Cute_As_a_Muslim_Girl_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
