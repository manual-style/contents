Modest fashion is a trend that is taking over the fashion industry.
Whether your modest attire is for religious reasons or personal
preference, you can transform your style by choosing modest tops,
selecting the appropriate pants, and accessorizing your outfit. Embrace
your personality and beliefs and sport your favorite modest styles.

## Steps

### Choosing a Modest Top

1.  Keep necklines 4 finger-widths or less down from your collarbone.
    This is a rule of thumb you can use for any occasion. To measure 4
    finger-widths, place your hand on your chest keeping your index
    finger lined up with your collarbone. If the neckline of your shirt
    is lower than your pinky finger, then your shirt is too
    low.[1]![](Dress_Modestly_Step_1.jpeg "fig:Dress_Modestly_Step_1.jpeg")
    -   Scoop neck shirts with floral patterns can keep your look classy
        and modest.
    -   Pair a high-scoop neck top with a blazer and slacks for a day at
        the office.
    -   Choose a loose button-down top with a pair of black
        straight-legged jeans, for an afternoon with friends.
2.  Select shirts that conceal your back and shoulders. If you want to
    dress modestly, do not show too much skin. Plain high-necked
    T-shirts, for example, are a great way to stay comfortable,
    fashionable, and
    modest.[2]![](Dress_Modestly_Step_2.jpeg "fig:Dress_Modestly_Step_2.jpeg")
    -   If your favorite shirt is a tight spaghetti strap camisole,
        drape a long-sleeve cardigan or a light jacket over it.
    -   Pair a long-sleeve shirt with a long denim skirt to sport your
        style while staying covered.
3.  Choose tunics or maxi dresses to stay cool in the summer. These are
    great options for outfits that don't cling to your body, and that
    are made from lightweight and breathable fabric. These are a classy
    way to stay cool and
    covered.[3]![](Dress_Modestly_Step_3.jpeg "fig:Dress_Modestly_Step_3.jpeg")
    -   Pair your favorite maxi dress with a lightweight wrap draped
        over your shoulders for a concealed and cool summer look.
4.  Add on the layers for a modest look throughout the seasons. Layers
    are the perfect way to add a stylish flair to a modest look. Go for
    lighter fabrics, such as cotton, nylon, and polyester for warmer
    months and wool during cooler
    weather.[4]![](Dress_Modestly_Step_4.jpeg "fig:Dress_Modestly_Step_4.jpeg")
    -   A polo-neck shirt under a vest or tank top with a light scarf is
        always a classic look for cooler seasons.
    -   For warmer weather, try layering a short-sleeve maxi dress with
        a light cardigan.

### Selecting Modest Pants

1.  Avoid see-through materials. If you decide to wear leggings or
    athletic pants, opt for those made with sturdier fabrics. It's
    always better to err on the side of caution. If you doubt the
    thickness of your pants, wear a shirt that conceals your
    derriere.[5]![](Dress_Modestly_Step_5.jpeg "fig:Dress_Modestly_Step_5.jpeg")
    -   Try going with pants made from a polyester blend, a cotton
        blend, or wool to avoid any unwanted exposure.
2.  Wear pants that fit you properly. A key style tip to dressing
    modestly is to choose fitted pants that don't cling to your body.
    Make sure that you can move comfortably in whatever style you
    choose.[6]![](Dress_Modestly_Step_6.jpeg "fig:Dress_Modestly_Step_6.jpeg")
    -   For a comfortable fall fashion, choose straight-leg denim jeans
        with a Â¾-sleeve tunic.
3.  Conceal your undergarments and the lines they cause. This is a must
    for dressing modestly. There is nothing modest about bending over to
    reveal your panty lines or the color and style of your
    bra.[7]![](Dress_Modestly_Step_7.jpeg "fig:Dress_Modestly_Step_7.jpeg")
    -   Test your look ahead of time by performing various tasks in
        front of the mirror. If you can move comfortably without seeing
        the outline of your panties every time you bend over, you are on
        your way to a modest look.
    -   Choose the undergarments that go well with your outfit. If you
        opt to wear tighter pants, choose a seamless panty.
4.  Choose shorts and skirts that are longer than your arm's length. A
    good rule to go by if you are aiming for a modest look is to keep
    shorts and skirts around the knee. If you can put your arm straight
    down to your side and the hem of your pants is shorter than your
    arm's reach, they are probably too
    short.[8]![](Dress_Modestly_Step_8.jpeg "fig:Dress_Modestly_Step_8.jpeg")
    -   Maxi skirts are a great choice to show your style while keeping
        your outfit modest. Pair it with a short-sleeve shirt underneath
        a tank top to keep yourself cool in the summer.

### Accessorizing Modestly

1.  Make a statement with totes and other handbags. A great way to
    change up your style from day-to-day is to change your handbag.
    Totes and other handbags are a creative way to enhance your outfit
    and add a bit of
    flare.[9]![](Dress_Modestly_Step_9.jpeg "fig:Dress_Modestly_Step_9.jpeg")
    -   Pair a leather tote with a blazer and slacks for a stylish
        workday.
    -   Add an aqua handbag to a short-sleeve dress for the perfect
        summer outfit.
2.  Utilize scarves as layers. Scarves are fantastic for adding a bit of
    dimension during any season. They also help cover up the skin around
    your neck, chest, and
    shoulders.[10]![](Dress_Modestly_Step_10.jpeg "fig:Dress_Modestly_Step_10.jpeg")
    -   Add a lightweight floral wrap scarf to accessorize a maxi dress
        and sandals for the summer.
    -   Combine fashion and warmth in the cooler seasons, by adding a
        fringe scarf to a cable knit sweater and denim jeans.
3.  Wear bold colored shoes to highlight your personality. From ballet
    flats to ankle boots, shoes can be very expressive. Add some bright
    colors to your modest outfit by experimenting with your favorite
    colors and styles. It's a great way to add a spark of flair while
    keeping your outfit
    modest.[11]![](Dress_Modestly_Step_11.jpeg "fig:Dress_Modestly_Step_11.jpeg")
    -   Experiment with a bold burgundy or emerald kitten heel with a
        pair of denim jeans and a long-sleeve scoop neck.
    -   Try a pair of pale pink ankle boots with black skinny jeans and
        a long tunic.
