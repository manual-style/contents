Have you ever been sitting with a skirt that turned out to be too small?
Have you worn a low rise shirt and felt uncomfortable with the way some
people looked at you? Do you want some steps to dress modestly? If so
keep reading.

## Steps

1.  Wear skirts that go at least as far as your knees. Make sure that
    when you bend down as far as you can go that you cannot see your
    upper thighs or your
    underwear.![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Girls)_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Girls)_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Make sure that your pants are not low rise. Be sure you wear a
    higher rise. They should be just below your bellybutton. If they are
    low-rise, they might reveal your underwear when you bend
    over.![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Girls)_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Girls)_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Make sure your shorts reach close to your knees and are not showing
    your upper thigh or butt. Like the pants, make sure your shorts are
    high
    rise.![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Girls)_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Girls)_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Wear T-shirts which cover your whole shoulder. Lift your arms into
    the air above your head, as if you were cheering, "Yay!" If your
    shirt feels too tight around the shoulders (and may also reveal a
    large portion of your stomach), it is too small. The same rule
    applies to sweaters as well. Be sure your tops are not too loose,
    but not tight either. Don't outline your figure suggestively, but
    don't wear extremely baggy
    clothes.![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Girls)_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Girls)_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Avoid clothes cut to reveal. Low cut clothes that emphasise cleavage
    are not modest. Skirts with high slits , backless tops, halter neck
    dresses and belly tops are not modest.
6.  Choose shoes, purses and clothes with colours that complement your
    skin and eyes. In other words, they should make you shine, not give
    you a flashy appearance. The correct solid, plain colors will make
    you look beautiful without all the glitter and other
    jazz.![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Girls)_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Girls)_Step_5.jpg")
7.  Try wearing little or no makeup. If you do wear makeup, make sure it
    is subtle and more natural
    looking.![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Girls)_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Girls)_Step_6.jpg")
8.  Consider what modest dress means in your culture or society. Some
    people think dressing modestly means being covered from head to toe.
    In some groups, having your head covered is required in public.
    Choosing clothes with simple colours and fastenings is important to
    some. Some people opt not to wear trousers deeming skirts and
    dresses to be modest and appropriate.

## Tips

-   When you dress modestly it is good to keep in mind that acting the
    way you are dressing is important. If you dress modestly but act in
    a not-so-modest way, people will not take you seriously. Your
    actions, words, and dress must complement each other.
-   If you can't find high rise pants/shorts, wearing a tank top
    underneath your clothes and tucking it in will help prevent showing
    any skin.
-   A good-natured and humble attitude goes well with looking modest.
-   Unless your clothes put you in physical danger, ie wearing lead
    boots to go swimming!, you can wear whatever you feel comfortable
    in. These steps are what constitutes modest dress for most people,
    your opinions, and the opinions of those in your family and
    immediate social circle may differ.

## Warnings

-   Do not judge others who do not act, dress, or talk the way you do.
-   It's getting harder to find modest clothing around, so don't be
    upset if you can't find any.
