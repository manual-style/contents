So you want to look tasteful without displaying certain parts of your
body? You also want to [look
conservative](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time "wikilink"), but not
like a nun. This tutorial will show you how to achieve a [fashionable
but modest look](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time "wikilink").

## Steps

1.  [Wear camisoles](Wear_a_Camisole "wikilink") under transparent or
    low necked shirts. This will keep your bra from showing and will
    allow you to wear trendy clothes without revealing too
    much.![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Know when shorts/skirts are too high. If you can't bend over at the
    hips without showing your underwear (check in your door mirror),
    it's too revealing and also consider wear some spandex under your
    skirt or dress to hide your
    underwear.![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Watch the [waistline on your
    jeans](Look_Good_in_Jeans_(Women) "wikilink"). It's not modest if
    you reach up to grab something at the grocery store and your jeans
    are so low-rise that we can see your lacy
    panties!![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_3.jpg")
4.  On the same note, make sure your shirts aren't too short. Sometimes
    it's easy not to notice this when you've grown in height; if you can
    reach all the way up without the shirt hem peeking up to show your
    midriff, you're
    golden.![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_4.jpg")
5.  [Don't wear things that are too
    tight](Choose_Good_Clothes "wikilink"). This includes spandex, and
    other stretchy materials. If you wear leggings make sure your
    underwear lines don't show and wear a longer shirt, tunic or dress
    on top. Remember to buy clothes that fit comfortably and don't
    purchase clothes that are too
    small.![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Wear things that have a fitted or tailored look. Your clothes should
    be about the same shape as you are, while not being clingy. This
    also makes you look older in a professional, college-age sort of
    way.![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Try some makeup. There's no harm in trying it. It can hide flaws and
    just make you look polished. If you do try makeup, keep it simple at
    first. Some mascara,light eye-shadow blush and some gloss or
    Chapstick.![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Just remember you are beautiful no matter how modest you
    are!![](Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_(for_Teenage_Girls)_Step_8.jpg")

## Tips

-   Don't show cleavage.
-   Don't wear shorts that are too short.
-   Don't wear white or light colored shirts without a camisole
    underneath because they are often see-through.
-   Remember, if you are wearing skirts or dresses, consider wearing a
    pair of short shorts or spandex shorts underneath to cover underwear
    up and don't bend over or spread your legs in a way in which others
    will be able to see underneath. You could wear leggings also.
-   If a shirt's neck is too wide, try putting a shirt underneath it or
    put a scarf on.
-   When shopping for modest clothing in a store, look at the shirts and
    sweaters that are folded in piles. They tend to be more modest than
    the clothing that's hung up.
-   Don't wear a white garment with white undergarments. The white looks
    more opaque in some areas, so everyone can see your bra or slip
    underneath it. Personally, I've found tighter-knit white sweaters to
    be the exception, but better safe than sorry. A color the same as
    your skin tone or just another shirt/dress/skirt can be helpful.
    White also isn't a great swimsuit color- it turns transparent when
    it gets wet..
-   If you wish to be modest, a good suggestion is; you should be able
    to stick two fingers between your pants and skin, also avoid showing
    bra straps or cleavage.

## Warnings

-   Don't look down on others if they decide not to dress as modestly as
    you. This does not make them any less worthy of respect.
