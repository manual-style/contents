If you recently decided to start dressing more modestly, you may feel a
little lost about how to do so while still looking fashionable. Contrary
to popular belief, "modest" and "fashionable" are not enemies. Decide
what your standards of modesty are, and find trendy pieces that fit
within those standards. Add layers to make things more modest, and adorn
yourself with the right accessories to add flair to your look.

## Steps

### Mind Your Modesty Rules

Every girl and woman has her own standards for modesty. For some,
religious beliefs may demand that the entire body remains covered when
in public. For others, modesty may simply mean avoiding cleavage and
minding hemlines. If your own standards are still in development,
consider adopting a few basic guidelines as you build your wardrobe. It
all depends on your nature.

1.  Keep your necklines no lower than four fingers below the collarbone.
    Anything lower may begin showing
    cleavage.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Avoid sheer materials or fabrics that sculpt your body, like
    spandex. These are often considered too revealing, and onlookers may
    be able to see your bra through tops like
    these.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Draw attention to your face, not your bust. Keep details on the
    collar, not the chest.

4.  Keep your back covered. Avoid halter or backless
    garments.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Keep your shoulders covered. Try to wear tank tops with some
    covering over
    them.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Mind the buttons on your shirt. Make sure that there are no gaps in
    between your buttons that could reveal the skin
    beneath.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Wear pants that are fitted, but not excessively tight in the seat or
    thigh. You should be able to pinch and pull a bit of the fabric away
    from your
    leg.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Keep panty lines hidden. Pantyhose, thongs and "thigh shapers" can
    help create a smooth appearance, if
    needed.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Choose shorts and skirts that extend past your arms. Hold your arms
    straight down at your sides. Keep your fingers extended, and make
    sure that your lower hems fall below the longest
    finger.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_9.jpg")
10. Opt for dresses that have sleeves or straps that are at least two
    inches thick. If you have anything thinner than that, throw a wrap
    or sweater over
    it.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_10.jpg")

### Layers Are Your New Best Friend

You can wear that cute tank top or frilly camisole and still be modest.
Knowing how to layer properly will give your wardrobe more versatility.

1.  Wear a cute tank top beneath a nice sweater or jacket. A fitted tank
    top with a high crew neckline can look lovely when paired with a
    cardigan sweater or fitted denim jacket. Add style to your look by
    choosing one with a fun print or embellishments at the
    collar.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_11.jpg")
2.  Disguise low necklines by placing a camisole or tank top beneath
    your shirt. If you fall in love with a top or dress that has a deep
    v-neck or low square neckline, do not despair. A plain camisole or
    one with feminine lace detailing at the neck can transform that
    garment into something that will work with your modest wardrobe.
    Many camisoles have adjustable straps, so you can extend the
    neckline of the camisole to cover up any cleavage or uncomfortable
    amounts of
    skin.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_12.jpg")
3.  Stock up on cute outerwear pieces. Think shawls, denim jackets,
    leather jackets, cardigan sweaters, blazers, military-style jackets,
    and more. The more variety you have in your outerwear, the more
    looks you can create. Outerwear is great for layering over pieces
    with low-cut backs or skinny
    straps.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_13.jpg")
4.  Keep your legs covered with skinny jeans and leggings. If you want
    to wear a dress or skirt, but worry that the hemline might be a bit
    too short, compensate by wearing something beneath it. Skinny jeans
    and leggings work well for many pieces. Be aware that many leggings
    may still look immodest, however, since they have a tendency to
    sculpt your body. To avoid this, only wear leggings with a skirt
    that covers your rear and most of your thighs. Do not wear
    super-short mini skirts that reveal everything the moment you sit
    down.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_14.jpg")

### Avoid "Frumpy" Looks

Modest does not mean frumpy. Avoid clothing that does not flatter you,
and aim for pieces that truly make you look your best.

1.  Look for fitted pieces. Fitted pieces do not mean “skin tight,” but
    they will brush against the natural contours of your body. You do
    not have to completely hide your curves to still be modest, though.
    Fitted pieces that lightly conform to your curves will actually make
    you look clean-cut and
    well-put-together.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_15.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_15.jpg")
2.  Try a knee-length skirt in a universally flattering cut. A-line
    skirts and pencil skirts are both timeless styles that look nice on
    most body types. Hemlines that fall at the knee, or thereabouts, are
    also the most universally
    flattering.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_16.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_16.jpg")
3.  Wear figure-flattering jeans and trousers. Go for classics like
    boot-cuts or straight-legged pants. These tend to pull away just
    enough to allow your leg room to breathe, yet they still look
    flattering on most
    figures.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_17.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_17.jpg")
4.  Try a variety of necklines. If high necklines are your thing, try
    mixing in a few mandarin collars with your turtlenecks and crew
    necks, or look for a V-neck that still sits high on your chest. Do
    not be afraid of low necklines, since many of these tops can be worn
    modestly simply by layering a camisole or tank top beneath
    them.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_18.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_18.jpg")
5.  Play with sleeve styles. You have more options available than the
    simple t-shirt style short or long sleeve. Look for a few
    short-sleeve tops with cap or puff sleeves, or long-sleeve tops with
    kimono, lantern, or bell sleeves. Choosing a fashion-forward sleeve
    is a good way to stay modest while looking
    trendy.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_19.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_19.jpg")
6.  Break out the nylon pantyhose. If your dress or skirt obeys most
    rules of modesty, but you still feel uncomfortable, cover your legs
    with nylon pantyhose. Plain nude or color styles work best, but you
    should avoid fishnets or nylons with
    patterns.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_20.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_20.jpg")
7.  Elongate your leg with heels. If you have a knee-length skirt or
    maxi skirt, consider wearing heels to make your legs look a little
    longer. Longer legs look attractive, but they do not necessarily
    look immodest. The right heel will help you look confident and
    beautiful without looking
    sultry.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_21.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_21.jpg")

### Add Personality with Accessories

You can have a lot of fun with your wardrobe and still look modest doing
it. Accessories are a very simple way of accomplishing this task.

1.  Try a variety of heels, fashion boots, and flats. Look for styles in
    bold colors, or those with some embellishment or
    decoration.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_22.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_22.jpg")
2.  Stick with shoes that look classy over shoes that look sexy. Opt for
    closed-toe pumps or open-toe pumps over strappy
    styles.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_23.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_23.jpg")
3.  Mind your heel height and thickness. Thin, extremely high heels are
    generally associated with sexiness. Consider “kitten heels” or other
    lower varieties to keep a ladylike
    appearance.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_24.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_24.jpg")
4.  Consider a trendy fashion scarf. Scarves are in style, and they come
    in a variety of colors, patterns, and looks. They also have the
    added benefit of covering more skin at the base of your neck and top
    of your
    chest.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_25.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_25.jpg")
5.  Don a hat. There is a broad range of fashionable hat styles, ranging
    from the fedora to the newsboy cap to the bucket hat. Look for one
    that suits the shape of your face and your personal taste. Buy a few
    in that style and wear them when you go out for an added, modest
    boost of
    style.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_26.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_26.jpg")
6.  Wear colorful jewelry. Wear one key piece at a time, or coordinate
    multiple pieces at once to bring color to your entire ensemble. Let
    your imagination run free while selecting watches, necklaces,
    bracelets, rings, and earrings. Stay away from non-traditional
    pieces, however, like lip rings, eyebrow rings, and tongue
    rings.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_27.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_27.jpg")
7.  Sling a fashionable bag over your shoulder. Nearly any standard
    purse will be a modest accessory. Look for a medium size in a
    neutral color for the most versatility, or mix things up by carrying
    around a large shoulder bag in a bold
    color.![](Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_28.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_and_Attractively_(Girls)_Step_28.jpg")

## Tips

-   Try your clothes on in front of a full-length mirror. Bend over, sit
    down, jump, and wave your arms around. Make sure your clothes do not
    shift around too much.
-   Do not throw out old clothes just because they seem immodest. Look
    for ways to reuse them by layering, or donate them to second-hand
    stores so someone else might be able to use them.
-   Ask your mother for advice in selecting clothes. While you don't
    necessarily want to look middle-aged (yet!) she might have some
    ideas on timeless styles. (And don't forget that she was young once
    too.)
