Modesty and grace in dressing are expected of Mormon women when
attending church and related Mormon functions. It is very easy to
achieve modesty and still remain fashionable. If you already have a
wardrobe, you can probably recombine it and end up with something
appropriate. You will be wearing a skirt and a matching shirt, or a
dress, with appropriate shoes.

## Steps

1.  Know what to
    avoid.![](Dress_Modestly_for_a_Mormon_Church_(for_Females)_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_for_a_Mormon_Church_(for_Females)_Step_1.jpg")
    -   Skirts or dresses that are too short. Knee length skirts or
        dresses are recommended.
    -   Clothing that is too tight. Clothes don't have to be baggy or
        uncomfortable to be "modest", but they shouldn't cling to your
        body. It can be fitted but if the cloth doesn't have enough
        stretch for you to put your hand under it, it's a bit too tight.
    -   Shirts that are see-through or very low cut.
    -   Sleeveless shirts. Capped sleeves are okay, but avoid halter
        tops or shirts with straps.
    -   You should avoid flip-flops, beach-styled shoes, running shoes,
        or sneakers. Dressy sandals are fine.
2.  Come as you are! If you don't have the exact right clothing, come
    anyway!

    -   The Sabbath is a special day and by coming to church you are
        visiting the Lord's house, so put your best foot forward and
        make sure that what you are wearing is neat and clean and the
        most pleasing of what you have.
    -   Some Mormon gatherings are formal even if it is not on Sunday so
        check before you decide what to wear
3.  Express your individuality with your style. As long as you dress
    modestly, anything else is basically up to you. Be
    yourself.![](Dress_Modestly_for_a_Mormon_Church_(for_Females)_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Modestly_for_a_Mormon_Church_(for_Females)_Step_3.jpg")

## Tips

-   Be yourself.
-   Don't use "modesty" as an excuse to cover up for laziness.
-   Keep it clean! Don't wear sexual clothing.
-   There is no dress code. There is only a guideline of modesty. Be
    creative and be yourself.
-   Ask a church leader if you are confused regarding what's modest and
    what's not.
-   It helps to know the rules of the particular church you are going
    to.
-   Many Mormons are very open to newcomers and would be more than happy
    to answer any questions regarding modesty.

## Warnings

-   We are all human; everyone makes mistakes. If you make a fashion
    mistake put it behind you and go on. It is important that you
    present yourself as the wonderful, modest girl that the creator made
    you to be.
