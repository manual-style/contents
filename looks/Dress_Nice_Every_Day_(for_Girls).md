Dressing nicely each day can take some effort but will ultimately be
worth it if your outfits make you feel confident and happy. If you want
to look great every day, you will first have to go through your wardrobe
and fill it with classic outfit staples. Looking awesome also involves
some planning and accessorizing that may take some getting used to but
will ultimately result in some stylish outfits.

## Steps

### Filling Your Wardrobe

1.  Buy classic pieces. To dress nicely, it is important to have some
    classic pieces in your wardrobe that will never go out of style.
    Classic pieces are articles of clothing that are generally not too
    extreme or dated. Instead, they are generally simple and elegant,
    like a navy blue blazer or a well-crafted black V-neck t-shirt.
    Though they may sound simple, you can always dress these pieces up
    with
    accessories.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_1_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_1_Version_4.jpg")
    -   Basic, classic pieces are generally easier to mix and match,
        which means that they can be used in a variety of outfits.
2.  Purchase a few accent articles of clothing. To go along with your
    classic articles of clothing, buy some accent pieces that will make
    your outfits pop, even if they are simple. These accents could be
    bright colors that you don’t normally wear, or patterns that
    pop.[1]![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_2_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_2_Version_4.jpg")
    -   For example, you could take an outfit that is as simple as a
        white t-shirt and a navy blue skirt, and make it interesting
        with a patterned sweater.
3.  Purchase clothes that you can mix and match. When going through your
    wardrobe, consider whether or not you can use each article of
    clothing in at least two different outfits. Mixing and matching is
    an important part of dressing nicely
    everyday.[2]![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_3_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_3_Version_4.jpg")
    -   While you most likely can’t purchase a new outfit for every day
        of the week, you can buy clothing that you can mix and match to
        create entirely new and exciting outfits.
4.  Consider your body when picking out your clothes. Certain clothes
    have cuts that look differently on different body types. Look for
    clothes that flatter your body and make you feel confident. Each
    person has their own idea of what they find flatters their bodies
    the most, so spend some time trying on different kinds of
    clothes.[3] For
    example:![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_4_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_4_Version_4.jpg")
    -   If you have a ‘Pear’ shape, which means that you have wider hips
        and a slimmer bust, you could try out an open-neck top, or a
        dress with an empire waist.
5.  Get rid of clothes that are worn or torn. Part of dressing nicely
    means giving away or selling old clothes. Clothes get worn out,
    especially if you wear the same piece a lot, and worn out clothing
    does not necessary look very classy—unless you are going for a look
    that involves faded clothes and torn
    jeans.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_5_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_5_Version_4.jpg")
    -   If you find that a shirt has a stain, [try your best to get it
        out](Get_Stains_out_of_Clothes "wikilink"), but if the stain
        remains, it might be time to toss the shirt. Clothes with stains
        tend to look a little sloppy.
6.  Consider your skin tone when buying your clothes. Picking out
    clothing that complements your skin tone can make a great outfit
    that much nicer. Of course, always keep in mind that if you don’t
    like a color or don’t feel like it looks good on you, don’t wear it.
    Part of dressing nicely is dressing yourself in things that make you
    confident and happy; if a color matches your skin tone, but you
    don’t like it anyway, don’t wear it. General guidelines for skin
    tones and clothing colors
    include:[4]![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_6_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_6_Version_4.jpg")
    -   Very light skin tones: Ice tones, pale pinks, greys, baby blues,
        navies, and grass greens.
    -   Medium-light skin tones: Pastel colors, cool reds, and blues.
        Avoid orange.
    -   Medium skin tones: Metallic tones, jewel tones, plums, wine
        reds, bright blues, deep purples.
    -   Medium-dark skin tones: Deep colors like dark greens, bright
        blues, pale yellows, warm reds.
    -   Very dark skin tones: Bright colors like burgundies, cobalt
        blue, bright orange, and red.
7.  Hang up your clothes and invest in an iron. Another part of dressing
    nicely is keeping your clothes in tip-top shape. This means hanging
    up clothes when you can, and ironing folded clothes. If you are not
    sure how to iron your clothes, click [here.](Iron "wikilink")[5]

### Planning Your Outfits

1.  Plan your outfits. One aspect of dressing nicely is taking the time
    to plan your outfits. This might mean planning your outfit the night
    before, or planning an entire week’s worth of outfits at the
    beginning of the week; go with what works best for you. Trying to
    figure out a great outfit in the morning before school may make you
    feel a little too stressed, so take some time to consider your
    wardrobe and try on several different outfits that you could
    wear.[6]
    ![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_8_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_8_Version_4.jpg")
    -   Some girls find that trying out outfits and taking photos of the
        ones that they like to put in a binder can help them to decide
        on an outfit when they are in a rush. If you plan a last minute
        outing with your friends, simply flip through the binder and
        pick out a pre-planned outfit.
2.  Consider the occasion you are dressing for. When planning your
    outfit, think about what you will be doing in that outfit. Different
    events call for different kinds of clothing. For instance, if you’re
    going to school, try not to show too much skin, or wear a shirt that
    is too low cut. On the other hand, if you’re going to the beach with
    your friends, wearing a summery dress and shoes you can walk through
    the sand with may be the way to
    go.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_9_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_9_Version_4.jpg")
    -   If you are not sure what would be appropriate to wear to a
        certain event, such as a [cousin's
        baptism](Dress_for_a_Baby's_Baptism "wikilink"), or a [job
        interview](Dress_for_an_Interview "wikilink"), don’t be afraid
        to ask friends or family for advice.
3.  Wear clothing that makes you feel confident. When picking out your
    outfit, make sure that you feel good in your clothes. Ultimately,
    you should be dressing nicely for yourself rather than dressing for
    anyone else. It is important to feel comfortable and happy in the
    clothes that you are wearing; projecting confidence and enthusiasm
    will give your outfit that extra, energetic
    boost.[7]![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_10_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_10_Version_4.jpg")
    -   Try to keep in mind that if someone only likes you when you are
        dressed up, that person might not have their priorities
        straight. First and foremost, dress the way that you want to
        dress.
4.  Try to avoid combining patterns. While you may be able to get away
    with some very subtle pattern combinations, it is generally a good
    idea to only have one pattern in your outfit. Clashing patterns can
    often make an outfit look
    sloppy.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_11_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_11_Version_4.jpg")
    -   For instance, if you were wearing an argyle sweater, you would
        most likely want to avoid wearing that sweater with a striped
        skirt.
5.  Consider using the rule of three. If you are having trouble putting
    together an outfit, using the ‘rule of three’ can help you to create
    a quick but elegant ensemble in no time. When using the rule of
    three, pick out three colors: two that will be your base colors
    (most likely your shirt and pants or skirt) and one that will be
    your accent
    color.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_12_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_12_Version_4.jpg")
    -   Your base colors could be subtler colors that go together well,
        such as navy blue shirt and camel skirt. Your accent color
        should be a brighter color that makes the rest of your outfit
        pop, such as a red thin belt or a silver-laced scarf.
6.  Try to wear something extra cute at least once a week. While you may
    want to look nice every day of the week, throwing on an outfit that
    really dazzles once a week can help to make you feel that much more
    well-dressed. Take the time to really come up with this eye-catching
    ensemble.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_13_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_13_Version_4.jpg")
7.  Try to avoid wearing the same outfit twice in a week. While this
    will not be possible if you have to wear a school uniform, or a
    uniform for work, try to avoid wearing the same outfit two times a
    week if you are planning on hanging out or being seen by the same
    people. If you have two different parties to go to, however, and the
    people at these parties won’t overlap, feel free to consider wearing
    the same great
    outfit.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_14_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_14_Version_4.jpg")
    -   By no means does this mean that you avoid wearing the same
        article of clothing twice in a week. If you have a skirt that
        works well in two different outfits, feel free to rock both of
        these ensembles in the same week. Remember, mixing and matching
        is the key to making you feel like you have an endless wardrobe.
8.  Create an emergency outfit. Some days, you might find that you just
    don’t want to wear the outfit you have planned. On those days, its
    important to have an emergency backup outfit. This outfit should be
    simple, comfortable, and easy to accessorize with. For example, your
    emergency outfit could be a pair of nice jeans, a tank top in your
    favorite color, and a cropped sweater. With these basic items
    already put together, all you need to go is add a necklace, scarf,
    or rocking pair of shoes and you’ll be good to
    go.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_15_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_15_Version_4.jpg")

### Accessorizing

1.  Pick out some shoes that will look classy. If you are shopping for
    shoes, try to pick out a couple of pairs that can be worn with most
    of your outfits. These could be classic black flats, a nice pair of
    boots, or short wedges that you can wear with your skirts and
    dresses.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_16_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_16_Version_4.jpg")
    -   Try on the shoes and make sure you can walk in them easily; if
        you are planning on wearing them with many of your outfits, it’s
        important to be able to walk in them.
2.  Wear shoes that would for the occasion. As with your clothes,
    consider the event you are going to when picking out the shoes you
    will wear that day. In certain formal events, sandals might not be
    appropriate, while wearing high heels at school might make it hard
    to get from class to class on
    time.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_17_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_17_Version_4.jpg")
3.  Keep your shoes looking brand new. If your shoes get damaged or
    scuffed, try to buff the marks out, or use polishes to make your
    shoes look shiny and new again. Part of looking nice is being
    dressed well—from your head to your feet. If you are not sure how to
    clean your shoes, take a look at some of the following
    articles:![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_18_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_18_Version_4.jpg")
    -   [Shine shoes](Shine_Shoes "wikilink")
    -   [Polish shoes](Polish_Shoes "wikilink")
    -   [Wash shoes](Wash_Shoes "wikilink")
4.  Try out different kinds of jewelry. Accessorizing can help to take
    your outfit to a whole new level. When creating outfits for
    yourself, try on different kinds of jewelry and see how they change
    or affect the outfit you are wearing. Sometimes, adding a statement
    necklace or chandelier earrings can take your outfit from nice to
    outstanding.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_19_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_19_Version_4.jpg")
    -   However, try not to over accessorize. For example, if you are
        planning on wearing a chunky necklace, try wearing a small pair
        of stud earrings, rather than a pair of dangling earrings that
        could make your jewelry feel overbearing.
5.  Consider where you want the focus to be when accessorizing. Jewelry
    can draw a person’s eye, which can be both a great thing, and an
    unwanted thing. For example, if you want your focus to be on your
    face, wear large or dangling earrings. If you want the focus to be
    on the rest of your outfit, consider wearing a longer necklace that
    ties your whole outfit
    together.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_20_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_20_Version_4.jpg")
    -   However, if you are wearing a low-cut shirt, try to refrain from
        wearing a longer necklace, as it might draw too much attention
        to your chest area.
6.  Try out different kinds of accessories. Accessories are not just
    limited to jewelry and shoes. You can really spice up an outfit by
    adding an accent scarf, a colorful belt, or a stylish hat. Play
    around with different kinds of accessories that fit into your
    style.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_21_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_21_Version_4.jpg")
7.  Create your own ‘golden rule’. The ‘golden rule’ refers to the
    maximum number of accessories you will allow yourself. This is
    completely based on your own opinion. Some people like to layer
    necklaces and wear funky shoes. Others, prefer a chic minimalist
    style in which you choose one or two accessories that compliment
    your
    outfit.![](Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_22_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Nice_Everyday_(for_Girls)_Step_22_Version_4.jpg")
    -   Remember that you can change your golden rule when you feel like
        it doesn’t reflect your personality anymore. For instance, maybe
        you like wearing three necklaces and a bunch of bracelets, but
        during the year your preferences chance and you decide to limit
        yourself to three accessories; go with what will make you feel
        happy and confident.
