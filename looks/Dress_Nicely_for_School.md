Dressing for school can be a challenge and sometimes difficult to figure
out what you are going to wear. Follow these steps and you can look
casual yet fashionable during the school day.

## Steps

### Tops

1.  Stay basic. T-shirts are a fantastic staple. Make sure you don't
    waste money on an impulse graphic tee, and if there is a design make
    sure it will have meaning for a few years.
2.  Wear camisoles in winter. Camisoles are a great layering piece for
    winter.
3.  Get loose plaids. Plaid shirts look good on everyone, just make sure
    they aren't too tight around your arms or shoulders.
4.  Look for special sweaters. Sweaters and hoodies that are casual and
    comfortable are always in, especially if they're from a school event
    or sports team.

### Bottoms

1.  Don't forget jeans. Jeans are a timeless, comfortable choice that go
    with anything.
2.  Keep sweatpants for backup. Sweatpants are a great backup for those
    standardized test days or if you feel in the dumps.
3.  Be cautious with shorts. Only wear shorts and leggings if they apply
    to your dress code.

### Shoes

1.  Use sneakers. Sneakers are universally accepted at any time.
2.  Wear boots in winter. Boots like Uggs or leather boots are great for
    winter.
3.  Stick to flats if you need to dress up. Heels will hurt your feet
    and make people think you're dumb for wearing them to school.

### Bags

1.  Carry a bag only if you're allowed.
2.  Look for a useful bag. Purses and cute backpacks are useful for
    carrying things like water (if allowed) lip balm, a nail file, hand
    sanitizer, and loose items like hair ties or pens.

### Makeup

1.  Makeup. This is fantastic for hiding that one pimple and making
    yourself feel good, and is completely optional.
2.  Don't pile on the entire container of blush or eyeshadow. A more
    natural and less terrifying look will feel better for you and look
    better for everyone else.
3.  Skip fake lashes and Kylie Jenner lips. They will weigh you down or
    smudge out of place by the end of the day.
4.  Wear makeup only if it's permitted. Or if you can get away with it.

## Tips

-   Be yourself. No one else will be you for you.
-   Choose colors that accentuate something about you, like your skin
    tone, hair, or eyes.
-   Following dress code will help you feel comfortable in the long run.
-   Draw inspiration from celebrities, but only inspiration. Make each
    outfit your own.
