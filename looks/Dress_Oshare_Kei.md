Do you like Oshare Kei? Here's a simple guide on how to dress like your
favorite bands.

## Steps

1.  Dress Oshare Kei by wearing makeup. Make sure when you choose make
    up you use bright colours. However, some Oshare Kei wearers keep
    their make up natural-looking (such as Teruki from An Cafe) , so you
    don't need to wear too much make up if you don't want to. Black
    eyeliner is commonly used in Oshare Kei. Look at pictures for ideas.
    There are videos of Cure Style Council on YouTube (Cure is a Visual
    Kei magazine in Japan), or you can just look up Oshare Kei make up
    tutorials - there are plenty of
    them.![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Dress Oshare Kei in bright colors. You can find many items at local
    stores which can be coordinated into an Oshare Kei outfit. Remember:
    Bright colors are key, but try to add some darker colors too, or you
    will just look
    'Decora'.![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Wear shirts with cute patterns and motifs. Animal print and polka
    dots are also good for Oshare Kei. A good place to get darker Oshare
    Kei like things is Sex Pot Revenge, a brand that An Cafe have worn
    before. As mentioned before, many things can be found in local
    stores. You just gotta shop around. Some Visual Kei clothes can also
    be classed as Oshare. You can find some things on eBay, but be
    careful and make sure you read the feedback and reviews of the
    items. Some Oshare Kei artists, such as Mashiro
    (ex:Himeyuri/x\[PaRADEis\]) and Waka (Danger Gang) incorporate
    clothing from the Lolita fashion. Make sure you get educated on
    Lolita fashion before wearing any of
    it.![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Choose jackets that look cute. Wear a fluffy jacket, or one with
    cute prints on it. Animal print, cartoons, anything as long as its
    bright and colorful. Remember, you can always sew your own
    clothing!![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Wear skirts or pants. These are obviously important (don't want to
    go without them now do we?). For skirts, get cute bright ones, and
    layer. Wearing bright leggings or knee high socks with skirts looks
    best. Get colors such as pink, purple, yellow or green. Any bright
    colors. You can layer the skirts, but make sure you don't look
    Decora, unless that's the look your going
    for.![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Dress in ripped jeans with bright leggings/socks underneath. Try
    shorts with socks/leggings (as Miku from An Cafe demonstrates oh-so
    well).![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
7.  Put on some knee high socks. Try striped socks or socks with bows on
    them. You can also layer them, but again, not too Decora. Pastel
    colors paired with bright colors look
    wonderful.![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Wear bracelets, but not too many (unless you want to of course!).
    Ones that compliment the outfit are
    best.![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
9.  Try on necklaces with cute things on them, these are good. Beads can
    also work. Some Oshare Kei wearers wear plushies on necklaces
    (JunJun from DOG in the PWO, Bou ex:An Cafe). These can look cute,
    but can be a bit much, and again look more
    Decora.![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
10. Have clean and shiny hair. Make sure it doesn't look scraggly. You
    could straighten your hair, curl it, dye it bright blue, anything!
    But it's got to be clean and neat looking. Look at pictures for
    inspiration.![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_10.jpg")
11. Try putting gems and stickers on your face. But don't go too over
    the top or you'll look like a sticker collection. Fake eyelashes
    also look
    good.![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
12. Consider getting piercings. Piercings look good in Oshare Kei, but
    you don't need them, as they are painful and leave scars. But if you
    have them, leave them, they look
    great!![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
13. Try different kinds of shoes. Converse, platform shoes, ugg boots,
    Lolita shoes and even slippers can work - just make sure they are
    bright and
    colorful.![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")
14. Listen to the music, obviously. A few popular Oshare Kei bands are
    An Cafe, x\[PaRADEis\], Decola Hopping, SuG, Lolita23q, LM.C and
    Aicle. There are many more than this, however.

15. Also listen to Visual Kei bands such as The GazettE, Versailles,
    Direngrey, Miyavi and Nightmare. If these aren't your thing, don't
    listen to them, your music taste is your music
    taste!![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_15_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_15_Version_2.jpg")
16. Make sure you don't look 'cosplay'. Well, not cosplay, because a lot
    of time, money and effort goes into that too...don't look BAD
    cosplay. Make sure you do enough research. Remember to be creative!
    Good luck and have
    fun!![](Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_16_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Oshare_Kei_Step_16_Version_2.jpg")
