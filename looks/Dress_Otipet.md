Otipet is a street fashion among the urban middle class in the Chusha
city of Ensha. While the political statement it carries is lost when
worn in other nations, foreigners can still show support for it's
wearers in Ensha and enjoy its general aesthetic.

## Steps

1.  Do your research. Don't just blindly wear the fashion; read up on
    the history of it and understand its
    meaning.![](Dress_Otipet_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Otipet_Step_1.jpg")
    -   Otipet developed in the city of Ensha around 2010, as a response
        to strict social class norms that prevented the lower middle
        class from wearing any "flashy" clothing. This only furthered
        the divide between economic classes.
    -   In protest, many teenagers started wearing clothing that would
        be normally considered plain and normal, except coordinate them
        or modify them in strange ways. For example, they would pair a
        long, loose wrap top with a skirt modified to be knee length. In
        other words, they would wear clothing that's otherwise boring
        and wear it in a flashy way.
2.  Get rid of all of your clothing that isn't black. Black is
    considered the default, humble color. While other colors such as
    brown and dark green are occasionally acceptable in small amounts,
    it's very hard for a beginner that doesn't understand the culture
    behind it to pull
    off.![](Dress_Otipet_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Otipet_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Get rid of all of your clothing that has embellishments.
    Embellishments include buttons, visible zippers, beads, laces,
    embroidery, frills, tassels, studs, and everything similar.
    Everything you wear should be purely
    fabric.![](Dress_Otipet_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Otipet_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Never wear jewelry. Unless it's extremely simple and made of cloth
    (like cloth wristbands), it isn't
    allowed.![](Dress_Otipet_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Otipet_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Get the essentials. Skirts are required (no pants), so invest in
    some good plain, black maxi skirts. If you're feeling daring, get
    some knee length or shorter skirts as well. Make sure that
    everything is black and plain, Also, other commonly worn items
    are:![](Dress_Otipet_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Otipet_Step_5.jpg")
    -   A plain, long black scarf.
    -   Simple cloth wristbands (often homemade; worn in Chusha by all
        classes to make the wrists appear smaller).
    -   Head wraps/scarves.
    -   Solid black tights.
    -   Plain canvas shoes.
    -   Easy to layer socks in various shades of black.
    -   Plain black shirts.
    -   Plain black shawls.
6.  Invest in a collection of gloves. They're such a common feature in
    Otipet that they're deserving of their own step; get a large
    variety, from chunky knit mittens to long, soft arm warmers. As long
    as they're plain black and lack embellishments, they will be
    useful.![](Dress_Otipet_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Otipet_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Do your hair in the traditional Chusha style. Big, chunky braids,
    hair carefully teased to be bigger, and dreadlocks are most common.
    Regardless of social position, in Chusha, the bigger the hair the
    better!![](Dress_Otipet_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Otipet_Step_7.jpg")
    -   Hair must be as long as possible, for both boys and girls. It's
        a sign of health and beauty.
    -   Don't dye your hair an unnatural color. If you already have, dye
        it back, or if you really must keep it, at least try to fade it.
    -   Consider dying your hair a few shades darker.
8.  Pair together clothing that doesn't match. For example, wear your
    aforementioned chunky knit gloves with a long, flowing skirt. Wear a
    different kind of sock on each leg. Wear a short skirt with a modest
    shawl. The point is to follow the "rules", yet still be
    contradictory and flashy in a roundabout
    way.![](Dress_Otipet_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Otipet_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Modify your clothes. Have too many maxi skirts? Cut the hem of one
    to make it asymmetrical. Accidentally tear the feet of your tights?
    Modify them to be a shrug
    instead.![](Dress_Otipet_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Otipet_Step_9.jpg")
10. Don't be afraid to go against Western norms. In Chusha it is still
    pretty normal for women to go completely topless, or at least to
    wear revealing tops. There's nothing strange about it. While most
    women will not be able to go topless, they still will be able to
    wear something that defies Western notions of modesty without going
    against traditional Chusha modesty
    norms.![](Dress_Otipet_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Otipet_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Chusha fashion is androgynous, and the men and women wear the
        same type of clothes. While some Otipet elements are borrowed
        from Western female fashion, they would not seem strange at all
        worn in Chusha and should not be too feminine when worn properly
        by a man.

## Tips

-   Feel free to experiment, but never forget the roots of the fashion.
    If you start wearing Otipet but your style evolved away from it,
    don't continue to call your style Otipet. It's an insult to the
    movement and culture it came from.
-   Clothes can be as cheap or as expensive as you want them to be. You
    can get a $3 skirt from Goodwill or a $1,000 one from a high end
    designer. As long as the color is black and the design is plain, it
    will work.
-   Accessorizing isn't really a thing in Otipet; instead, to make an
    outfit interesting you'll need to come up with interesting
    combinations. However, your choice in gloves, hairstyle, and hat can
    still make a difference.

## Warnings

-   Don't try to mix in gothic elements. Just because it's black doesn't
    mean it's goth.
