Be flirty, fun, and afford it at summer camp.

## Steps

1.  It's normally hot at summer camp. Bringing the tightest shirts you
    own probably won't be the most comfortable, and if you sweat too
    much it's unattractive and you smell
    bad.![](Dress_Popular_and_Affordable_at_Summer_Camp_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Popular_and_Affordable_at_Summer_Camp_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Tops such as tank tops or t-shirts work well. If you're in middle
    school or the first few years of high school, Hollister and
    Aeropostale have cute tops. If those are too expensive or you don't
    like brands, Target has very cute, lightweight tanks and t-shirts.
    Remember, though, if you wear t-shirts a lot you may get a farmer
    tan, and then you can't wear tank tops
    anymore!![](Dress_Popular_and_Affordable_at_Summer_Camp_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Popular_and_Affordable_at_Summer_Camp_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Shorts are perfect. Most people don't walk around in jeans. Make
    sure they're not awkward half-shorts or Bermudas (remember, you want
    to be stylish, not dressed like your mom). But don't make them too
    short--you are at summer camp, and dressing like a slut isn't
    generally
    encouraged.![](Dress_Popular_and_Affordable_at_Summer_Camp_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Popular_and_Affordable_at_Summer_Camp_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Swimsuits come in many styles, like tankinis, bikinis, one pieces,
    etc. One swimsuit is generally okay if you'll only be gone for a
    week, but for more than that, two should be good. Some camps have
    guidelines about bikinis, and they might make you wear a tank top
    over it--just be prepared. You can't be scared that any part of your
    swimsuit will fall off,
    either.![](Dress_Popular_and_Affordable_at_Summer_Camp_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Popular_and_Affordable_at_Summer_Camp_Step_4.jpg")
5.  For shoes, flip flops will be worn by virtually every girl there.
    You can get some pretty cheap ones at Old Navy. A basic pair of
    brown rubber flip flops will get you far. Other than that, bring at
    least one pair of gym shoes--Converse are always cute--and maybe
    other practical pairs of shoes. No
    heels!![](Dress_Popular_and_Affordable_at_Summer_Camp_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Popular_and_Affordable_at_Summer_Camp_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Overnight camp outs. You'll probably end up going on one, and no
    matter how hot a camp can get during the day, the nights are the
    extreme opposite. Bring a hoodie--either one from your school or
    sport, or a Hollister/Abercrombie one--and plaid flannel pants,
    sweatpants, or yoga pants. Camp outs are the one time where it is
    more than acceptable to completely rank of bug spray, as
    well.![](Dress_Popular_and_Affordable_at_Summer_Camp_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Popular_and_Affordable_at_Summer_Camp_Step_6.jpg")
