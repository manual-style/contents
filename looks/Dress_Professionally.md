Dressing professionally is vital for success in an office or academic
environment. Your appearance makes a statement on your professionalism,
and showing up in sloppy or inappropriate attire can kill a career!
Although what constitutes as 'professional' varies from office to
office, there are a few key style guidelines to follow.

## Steps

### Determining the Level of Formality of Your Workplace

1.  Always dress to match the workplace setting. Some workplaces will
    provide a written dress code outlining specifically what is
    appropriate and what is not. For others, you may have to judge based
    on what others there are
    wearing.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Formal Business attire is typically the dress code used for
        high-profile jobs: government officials, managing workers,
        lawyers, and so on. It is also for businesses which cultivate
        formality, such as credit unions. Be aware some businesses dress
        formally most days, but have "casual Friday" or will otherwise
        relax the rules for certain reasons or occasions (such as a
        walk-a-thon, fundraiser, or if the air conditioning breaks
        down).
    -   "Business casual" is the term often used for less formal (but
        not *informal*) office environments. (See below for a more
        in-depth discussion on what "business casual" means) .Be aware
        that this varies by culture, region, and profession. Sometimes
        "business casual" offices will become "business formal" for
        important occasions, such as a press conference, a high-profile
        visitor arriving, or an important seminar.
    -   "Black tie" is typically only used only for very specific and
        special events, (such as awards dinners, formal banquets, or
        galas.) These typically require a tuxedo for men and an evening
        gown for women.
    -   Typically, the higher paying the position, the higher your rank,
        the more professionally your office clothing should be.
        (However, note this is not universal--the CEO of a software
        company may dress far less formally than an intern at a law
        firm!)
    -   Some jobs have a specific uniform. For instance, a chef, nurse,
        life guard, judge, or police officer. This is a professional
        dress code, but usually this needs very little further
        discussion.
2.  Know your Office Culture. Making professional dress even more
    confusing is the fact that types of work environment make a big
    difference in what one wears. Although you are usually fine
    following guidelines as discussed, realize that workplaces may
    encourage a certain "look" that goes beyond simple "Office Formal"
    or "Business Casual" definitions. This usually has to do with what
    the company makes, sells, or
    provides.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   An African aid organization, for instance, may encourage people
        to dress in clothes made in Africa and sold on its website in
        order to promote awareness and fair trade.
    -   The athletic department of a university may be much more
        accepting of athletic clothing such as running shoes.
    -   Highly artistic or creative workplaces may allow a lot more
        leeway in the way of dress. A fashion-based office may have much
        different expectations of dress than an accounting firm.
3.  Factor in the season--sometimes. Professional dress code in much of
    the world has some seasonality, based partially on the weather but
    also on seasonal styles. But be aware that some regions do not
    really have changes in clothing based on seasons. (Such as the
    tropics). But for areas with clothing seasons, many areas the
    following rules of thumb
    apply:![](Dress_Professionally_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Linen, seersucker, and madras cloth tend to be appropriate for
        summer only.
    -   Wool clothing tends to be for fall and winter only.
    -   In America, an old saying is "no white after Labor Day"...which
        used to refer to white linen fabrics used a lot in summer
        dresses rather than absolutely no white whatsoever. This is a
        very outdated rule. Feel free to brazenly wear a white shirt in
        the office in winter.
    -   Layers of appropriate clothing can help negotiate in-between
        seasons, when temperatures can fluctuate. For instance, a
        cardigan can be useful coming into work on a crisp fall day, and
        removed later when it warms up. A pair of warm leggings can
        allow you to wear skirts comfortably in winter.
    -   Keep in mind that the amount of visible skin allowable will be
        slightly different in business settings. What is acceptable in
        one culture may be unacceptable in another. For instance, what
        is fine for a women in France may be too revealing in Qatar.
    -   If you choose to remove layers of clothing, make sure you are in
        no way being revealing or inappropriate about the skin you
        choose to show. If you are wearing a camisole under a blazer,
        and you are not supposed to have a sleeveless shirt, you may be
        out of luck.
4.  Know what colors to wear. No color is completely "off limits" but it
    is more formal and professional stick mainly with a neutral color
    palette. Formal business suits for both men and women tend to be
    black, brown, gray, tan, or navy blue. Shirts tend to be lighter in
    color, with white, off-white, and light shades of
    colors.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   This limited color palette may sound boring and dull at first.
        However, it also can create a wardrobe that allows for many
        items to interchange easily. Basing a wardrobe around black,
        white, and khaki will assure that everything goes with just
        about everything.
    -   "Pops" of color with accessories such as ties, shoes, and
        scarves are typically fine, but, it is safer to go with subtle
        rather than bright and bold.
    -   Multi-colored shirts can be acceptable, such as a classic
        striped Oxford-style shirt.
    -   These guidelines are for people who need to make their dress
        more professional. Brighter and more varied colors can be
        entirely appropriate, depending on the occupation, and the
        overall appearance of the outfit. But if you are unsure or
        inexperienced, select conservative colors--they are perennial
        office clothes favorites because they always look right.
5.  Pay attention to those around you. If you are unsure exactly how
    formal or casually to dress, try looking at the clothing choices of
    those in your profession, at your office, or attending the same
    event as
    you.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
    -   In general, it is better to be slightly overdressed than it is
        to be under-dressed.
    -   If you are not able to get a good glimpse or have a chat with
        someone in your field, try searching images on the internet for
        people in similar positions in the company or last year's event.
        Pay attention to the appearance of people in these images, and
        dress accordingly.
    -   Be careful of events that may require a dramatic wardrobe
        change. For instance, at a conference, you may be required to
        wear suits and ties for the presentation. At the poolside
        cocktail receptions afterwards, swimsuits, Hawaiian shirts, and
        flip-flops are the garb of choice.
6.  Remember good grooming. A great outfit will only get you so far. If
    you are lacking personal hygiene or have a bad haircut, you will not
    look professional. Make sure that you treat your entire appearance,
    (including hair, skin, and hygiene), with the same professional care
    as you do with your
    clothing.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Shower. How often varies with culture, weather, and activity
        level. In most of America, at least every other day.
    -   Use deodorant.
    -   Make sure your hair is tidy and well-groomed.
    -   Facial hair (if any) should be trimmed and tidy. Stubble is not
        generally acceptable. "unibrow" eyebrows or very heavy eyebrows
        are often considered unattractive in many areas.
    -   For women, legs should either be shaved or bare legs covered.
    -   Good oral hygiene matters. Be sure your breath has no noticeable
        odor. This is particularly important if you smoke or eat pungent
        food.
    -   Makeup for women should generally be restrained, according to
        culture.[1]

### Dressing Business Formal

1.  Know that formal business attire is tailored, conservative clothing.
    Although fashion changes the little details, the essential core of
    formal office attire has really not changed much in decades.
    Dressing business formal is in some ways easier than in business
    casual, because the parameters are a lot narrower and well-defined.
    Both genders are typically expected to wear suits, typically in
    neutral colors (as described above). In general, men and women wear
    the
    following:![](Dress_Professionally_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For men: Formal suit, dress shirt, dress shoes, tie. Sometimes
        dressy slacks and sport coat are acceptable alternatives for a
        business suit. Often a shirt without an outer garment is
        acceptable.
    -   For women: business suit with skirt, blazer, blouse, dress
        shoes. Pants are also acceptable. A conservative dress may be
        substituted for a suit.
2.  Pick your strong suit. Suits should be tailored for fit. Solid
    colors or pinstripes, and in good condition. Skirt suits should be
    knee-length and not too
    tight.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Choose the right tops. Shirts should be typically solid or
    pinstriped, tailored for fit, laundered, and ironed if
    required.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Long sleeves are always more formal.
    -   Short sleeves are typically acceptable for spring and summer.
        However, some workplaces and cultures frown on bare arms.
    -   Women typically should steer away from sleeveless shirts if
        unsure if they are accepted or not. In some regions sleeveless
        shirts (but not one with straps, such as halter tops) are
        considered perfectly acceptable. In others, they are not
        considered appropriate. Tank tops, camisoles, tube tops,
        strapless tops amd "spaghetti strap" tops are not office formal
        clothing.
    -   Men should match shirt to tie.
    -   Women have to be extra careful in the cut and fit of office
        tops. Put bluntly, (especially for full-figured women) the
        bustline must be fitted properly so that it is not too
        revealing, too tight, or otherwise exposing more of the breasts
        so it is inappropriate. If your blouse gaps at the buttons of
        the bustline, the shirt does not fit you properly. Fabric or
        "fashion" tapes can be purchased to hold blouses in the right
        position.
4.  Choose your ties carefully, men. Ties can allow for some color and
    pattern in an outfit that would be rather drab. It attracts
    attention, so be very careful in what you choose. Not all ties are
    appropriate for business formal dress
    code.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Opt for either solid color, or have a small (no larger than a
        quarter) sized print that covers them.
    -   Avoid ties that have more than 3-4 colors total, and which have
        an image or scene printed onto them.
    -   Ties should match both your shirts and your suits and make sure
        they use colors that match or go with the rest of your outfit.
    -   Try to buy shirts and ties together, if possible. Men's stores
        coordinate colors to try to make the buying process easy. It may
        not be the same colors next year or even next season! If in
        doubt, ask for help--a good quality store will be happy to help
        you.
    -   Bow ties are also generally considered acceptable. However, they
        are far less common and can be considered unusual or "quirky".
    -   Bolo ties are often regionally acceptable in areas of the
        American South, Southwest, and West coast. However, they may or
        may not be considered an acceptable replacement for a tie
        depending on the workplace.
5.  Say yes to the dress, ladies! Dresses can easily be worn in a
    business formal setting, but be careful with your selection. Choose
    dresses that are knee-length or longer, and are in a subtle print or
    solid color. Dresses should not be too tight-fitting and should not
    be revealing/ have a plunging
    neckline.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
    -   A good blazer or suit jacket can make a dress more formal and
        versatile. This sort of outfit is the basis of the classic "day
        to night" women's wear, in which a woman goes to work wearing an
        evening appropriate dress coordinated with a work appropriate
        blazer. At the evening rendezvous, put aside the blazer for a
        less formal look.
6.  Choose the right shoes for the job. Business formal jobs all require
    quality footwear, typically made of leather (or similar high-quality
    material).![](Dress_Professionally_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Men should always wear formal shoes, often in the baroque or
        oxford style.Lace up is more traditional.There are many slip-on
        loafers that also may be appropriate and formal. Black is the
        go-to color, although brown is sometimes acceptable.
    -   Women should typically wear low or moderate high heel shoes or
        flat pumps. Conservative boots are sometimes appropriate. Make
        sure details and embellishments are restrained. Women generally
        have more choice in color, but sticking to black and neutral
        colors is still safer.
7.  Sock it to them. In a formal office, white cotton athletic socks are
    usually not acceptable. If you are wearing socks, they should
    usually be dark (black is typical). Ideally they go with the pants
    or
    shoes.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Women, wear your nylons. In a formal workplace, you should usually
    wear pantyhose, or tights under your skirt. Choose sheer tights in a
    neutral color.
    ![](Dress_Professionally_Step_14_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_14_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Leggings are not appropriate in a formal workplace; choose
        opaque tights instead.
    -   Barelegged (although well groomed) is becoming more acceptable.
        But if in doubt, put on a pair of pantyhose or tights.[2]
9.  Add other accessories. To complete your outfit, remember some
    accessories. In general, keep jewelry and other accessories subtle
    and tasteful. Be careful of wearing too much, although what
    constitutes "too much" will vary from culture to culture. Also, what
    is OK for a man and a woman may be different. For
    instance:![](Dress_Professionally_Step_15_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_15_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For men: cuff links, rings (such as a class or wedding ring),
        watch, pocket square (very formal). Necklaces and bracelets are
        often uncommon but usually acceptable if in good taste. Medical
        Alert jewelry is always OK. Most formal offices will not look
        favorably on body piercings, including earrings. Belt buckles
        should generally not be oversized.
    -   For women: Jewelry (rings, necklaces, earrings, bracelets,
        watches ) are all typically acceptable, but be careful of too
        much or too large pieces. Pierced ears are almost universally OK
        (with studs or small earrings), generally other body piercings
        should not be visible. Scarves, belts, headbands, hair
        accessories (such as barrettes), are also all fine.

### Dressing Business Casual

1.  Avoid the "Business Casual Don'ts". This is less formal and casual
    than traditional business guidelines. Unfortunately, it is often
    poorly defined and can be greatly different from one business to
    another. For instance, one business will be fine with Hawaiian print
    shirts with collars, while another will consider it too casual
    despite the collar. However, in general, the following are usually
    frowned
    upon:![](Dress_Professionally_Step_16_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_16_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Jeans: especially ones with tears, stains, patches, or
        embellishments such as studs. (Although a more detailed
        discussion on blue jeans in the workplace is below).
    -   Tank tops: especially spaghetti-strap styles.
    -   Shorts: Sometimes more tailored styles are acceptable--such as
        ones that resemble full length khakis, but shorter. Athletic
        styles are usually not OK.
    -   Informal T-shirts: Usually collared polo-type T-shirts are
        acceptable, or ones with shaping. If in doubt, do not go with
        *any* graphic images on your shirts. Shirts usually should not
        have elements which could be controversial or unacceptable--such
        as references to alcohol, sex, or violence. Avoid novelty
        T-shirts, (such as ones with cartoon characters) as this may
        come off as immature.
    -   Mini-skirts: Skirts should be no higher than about two inches
        above the knee.
    -   Plunging neckline: Be sure your V-neck shirt is not revealing
        too much, or your blouse buttoned too low.
    -   Keep it clean and tidy. Never come into work with clothes that
        are dirty, stained, ripped, or wrinkled (the one exception for
        wrinkled may be if that is part of the look, such as a
        seersucker shirt or crinkle cotton skirt).
2.  Know the definite "Office Casual
    Do's":![](Dress_Professionally_Step_17_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_17_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For men and women alike, business casual typically consists of a
        clean, pressed button-up shirt and a pair of neutral (such as
        khaki) slacks. Look for styles such as:
    -   Polo-style shirts: This collared shirt is the quintessential
        "office casual" choice for both men and women. Usually it will
        be available in a solid or striped. It can sometimes be found
        with a geometric pattern.
    -   Oxford-style shirt: This is acceptable in formal office clothing
        as well - a well-tailored shirt always looks good whether with
        khakis or a business suit.
    -   Tailored T-shirt: Some workplaces are fine with T-shirt style
        tops, as long as they are not informal T-shirts. For instance, a
        T-shirt with a classic scoop or crew neckline on a woman.
    -   Product shirts. In an office-casual workplace, often shirts
        given to you by your company or products that your company sells
        are acceptable. For instance, if you work at a company that
        sells outdoor equipment, wearing your company's shirts may be
        acceptable. But be careful--just because your company sells tank
        tops may not make it OK to wear tanks tops to your accounting
        job!
3.  Choose the right bottoms. Find a few pairs of black, navy blue,
    khaki, or brown pants. In "office casual" the pants are usually
    cotton and can be a little more "relaxed" than those found in formal
    offices. Woman can wear skirts into the mixed in the same
    aforementioned color
    palette.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_18_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_18_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Avoid patterns if you are unsure on what looks professional.
        There are great, classic patterns such as pinstripe that look
        great on pants, but it is easy to make a mistake.
    -   Generally avoid wearing white pants or a skirt. While entirely
        appropriate, these items can stain easy...if you spill your tea
        you may be out of luck.
    -   A patterned skirt can be appropriate for women. Try a small
        floral or geometric print.
4.  Select a few jackets or sweaters. It will inevitably get chilly, so
    make sure you have the right items for cold weather. Men can choose
    to wear a cardigan, sweater, or sports coat over the top of their
    button up shirt for a smart look. Women can wear layered sweaters,
    cardigans, and structured jackets and blazers to good effect. When
    desired/necessary, a pashmina or cashmere scarf can be worn for
    added warmth and
    style.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_19_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_19_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Consider wearing dresses (for women). Dresses are sometimes
    appropriate in a business casual setting, so long as they follow a
    few basic guidelines. Dresses should be knee-length or longer,
    expose no skin below the collarbone, and mostly cover the shoulders.
    Small patterns and solid colors work best, and can be accessorized
    for added visual interest. Throw on a cardigan or matching jacket
    for layering in cooler weather.
    ![](Dress_Professionally_Step_20_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_20_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Pick the right shoes. Business casual offices vary widely in shoe
    choice, based on the type of environment. Some good
    guidelines:![](Dress_Professionally_Step_21_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_21_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Close-toed shoes. Sandals are usually a no-no. Flip-flops are a
        definite "no". Women can wear flats or heels, but they must be
        in good condition and quality. In general, stick to neutral
        colored shoes and stay away from bold patterns.
    -   Be careful of really, really casual shoes. Even if it is
        closed-toe, some shoes usually do not belong in a professional
        environment. For example, high top Converse sneakers are best
        left to teenagers. The classic "Croc" shoe is much too casual
        for most professional workplaces. [3]

### Avoiding Common Mistakes

1.  Do not shop at the junior's department for work clothes. If you are
    old enough to have to consider professional clothing, do so where
    grown-ups shop. That also goes for clothing stores that cater
    exclusively to teens and very young adults like "Forever 21". That
    does not necessarily mean you have to dress exactly like your mother
    or father. However, if you are trying to find clothing to help you
    to be taken seriously as a young adult, you have to accept that you
    have to dress the part--at least at
    work.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_22.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_22.jpg")
2.  Shop at stores with high customer service. In putting together a
    wardrobe of work clothes, often your best ally are good salespeople
    in a quality store. This can be a stand-alone store, such as a
    menswear store, or a department store. A knowledgeable salesperson
    can help you select clothing to meet your needs, be sure it fits
    properly, and accessorize
    appropriately.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_23.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_23.jpg")
    -   Try to find a salesperson dressed more or less in the way you
        want to dress. This may be a good indication that he or she has
        a fashion sensibility that matches yours. However, be open for
        other individuals. That matronly salesperson may actually really
        know what the young people like these days!
    -   It can help to bring someone whose judgement you trust to this
        sort of shopping trip.For instance, your mother or your
        fashion-savvy friend.
    -   Yes, you need to try on the clothes. Ill-fitting clothes are not
        professional, and fit cannot typically be judged well on a
        hanger. If ordering online, be prepared to send back things that
        do not fit.
    -   Make sure of fit. Just because you can wear it does not mean it
        fits properly. This includes pants that are showing the lines of
        your underwear, and baggy oversized shirts.
    -   Minor alterations are usually available at higher-end stores,
        and can make a great different in fit and appearance.
    -   Remember: the salesperson will ultimately sell you whatever you
        want, even if it really is not in line with appropriateness or
        good taste. Be sure that you keep your goal in sight, and not
        revert to great clothing that cannot be worn to work.
3.  Be careful with jeans. To most of the world, blue jeans are a simple
    "no-no" in the workplace; they are considered appropriate for manual
    labor or leisure. However, America has *some* office-casual
    workplaces that are fine with jeans in the office. Before wearing
    your blue jeans to the office, really be sure it is OK with
    management. If in doubt, do not bring them to the office. Generally,
    however, non-ripped and un-embellished, dark wash jeans are
    better.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_24.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_24.jpg")
4.  Keep your accessories to a minimum. Although accessorizing can be
    fun, piling on too many accessories can give a messy

    -   One accessory should usually be the focus.
    -   An old but still useful rule: Accessorize, but before leaving
        the house, take one item off.
    -   In general, wear a single necklace, pair of earrings, and one
        ring per hand at any time.
    -   Only a single bag or briefcase (never a fanny pack!) should be
        brought to work.
5.  Try to cover up body modifications. Although not all offices
    advertise a preference for clear-skinned individuals, most
    workplaces expect employees to be as natural as possible. If you
    have large tattoos in obvious places or body piercings outside the
    ears, it may be necessary to slightly adjust your clothing to cover
    them. There is nothing wrong with having these things, but according
    to traditional dress code, they shouldn’t be shown when you’re on
    the
    clock.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_26.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_26.jpg")
6.  Keep your clothes in good condition. Make sure you always wear
    clothes that are clean and pressed, or else give the impression of
    poor hygiene. Practice setting out your outfit the night before you
    wear it, so you are not at a loss for what to
    wear.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_27.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_27.jpg")
    -   Do your laundry once a week and ironing when necessary so that
        you do not deplete your arsenal of clean clothing and be forced
        to wear dirty clothes.
7.  Do not repeat outfits within in the same week. Whether you are
    running late and just head to your go-to outfit, or you just really
    love an outfit, avoid wearing the same exact outfit in a seven-day
    work
    period.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_28.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_28.jpg")
    -   Mixing and matching pieces is important and maximizes the
        usefulness of your wardrobe.
    -   Try practicing the two-week rule, where you only wear an outfit
        (where every piece is being repeated) only once in a two-week
        period.
8.  Make sure your clothing "plays well together". Having all the right
    wardrobe pieces is great, but if they do not coordinate, they are
    essentially
    useless.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_29.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_29.jpg")
    -   Be sure to have more "basic" pieces than "statement" pieces. You
        will get more use out of certain items that will go with
        practically everything. There is nothing wrong with more flashy
        pieces, but they tend to not go with as many items.
    -   Try to buy items at the same store at the same time. Many store
        have clothing lines that are to be made in similar colors,
        patterns, and design. You are more likely to find coordinated
        outfits this way.
    -   As long as you match all your neutrals and add in a pop of
        color, you are likely be in good shape.[4]
9.  Keep a back-up outfit at work. If possible, have clothing that you
    can change into if there is a mishap at work. A shirt and bottom
    (such as pants or a skirt), shoes and a tie can be a lifesaver if
    you get caught in the rain or someone spills something on you. This
    is also a good use of clothing that may not be your favorites, but
    are appropriate and fit you all
    right.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_30.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_30.jpg")
10. Do not wear anything that your boss or other superior will frown on.
    Your right to dress how you want in large part stops at the office
    door. This can mean that even if your clothes technically fit a
    dress code or guideline, your superiors can veto your apparel choice
    and to a large extent, *there is very little you can do about it.*
    This is not high school, where coming to school with an
    objectionable T-shirt just gets you to have to turn in
    inside-out.![](Dress_Professionally_Step_31.jpg "fig:Dress_Professionally_Step_31.jpg")
    -   Issues such as head-scarves for religious reasons may or may not
        be legally protected in your country or state.
    -   Laws against sexual discrimination or inequality can also offer
        some protection, again depending on your area.

## Tips

-   Always use deodorant, although avoid using anything with too strong
    of a scent.
-   Don't wear clothes that are too baggy or too tight.
-   If your superior wears it, it is probably acceptable in the
    workplace.
