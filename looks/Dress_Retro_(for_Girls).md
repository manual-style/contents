Whether you’re building the perfect Halloween costume or looking to
spice up your wardrobe with a vintage flair, retro styles are incredibly
fun to work with. The term “retro” can refer to anything that references
the past, but typically the word brings to mind the decades of the
fairly recent past, with the most popular being retro styles of the
1980s, 1970s, 1960s and 1950s. Each decade has unique characteristics
that define that particular time in history, and all of them feature
trends that continue to look great today.

## Steps

### Dressing 1980s Retro

1.  Shape your outfit. The 80s were defined by a unique blend of
    different styles that emphasized extravagance and materialism.
    Over-the-top clothing in bold (often neon) colors was the norm.[1]
    Women’s fashion leaned toward oversized tops paired with leggings,
    tight pants, or a
    miniskirt.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Pull out any and all leggings you might have, in any color.
        These could be worked in to almost any 80s style outfit you can
        come up with.
    -   Get an oversized t-shirt, preferably in a neon color. Roll the
        sleeves up and cut the neck out so that it hangs off your
        shoulder. Wear a brightly-colored tank top under it.
2.  Mix and match styles and colors. Mixing bold, bright (usually neon)
    colors was very stylish in the 80s. Incorporating lace, designer
    logos and shoulder pads on top of the bright colors was even
    trendier. Everything in the 80s had to be big and loud, so start
    putting together outfit ideas that include bright colors,
    extravagant designs and anything with shoulder
    pads.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Pair bright leggings with an oversized t-shirt in a contrasting
        color. Add one or two more colorful accessories, such as a belts
        or a pair of leg warmers.
    -   Add some lace! Wear lacy black tights under a brightly-colored
        miniskirt, or a loose, black lace top over a bright miniskirt
        and neon tights.
    -   Raid your parents' closet for anything with shoulder pads. If
        you can't find anything, create your own shoulder pads by
        stuffing socks into the shoulders of your top.
3.  Wear acid-washed denim. Acid-washed jeans were huge in the 80s and
    women opted for a slim-fitting, high-waisted fit. Acid-washed jean
    jackets were also staples in the 80s, worn by both men and
    women.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Buy a denim jacket from a thrift shop, then cut the sleeves off
        and wash it so that the shoulders fray a little.
    -   Acid-wash an old pair of jeans to give them an authentic 80s
        feel. All you need is bleach, rubber bands, and your chosen
        jeans.
4.  Accessorize excessively with bright colors. Neon colored sunglasses
    in large sizes, lots of colored bangles on both arms and huge hoop
    earrings are great jewelry choices.[2] Look for anything with lace,
    especially gloves and headbands, to add to your ensemble as
    additional
    accessories.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Costume jewelry was also very popular. The chunkier, gaudier,
        and brighter, the better. The 80s celebrated excess!
5.  Embellish with quirky details and 80s kitsch. For instance, try to
    track down a brightly colored fanny pack to wear with your outfit.
    "Members Only" jackets were very popular at the time, as well, and
    are relatively easy to find at thrift stores. Carry a boombox along
    with you for an instantly recognizable 80s
    flair.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
6.  Experiment with 80s hair styles. There are several ways to approach
    80s hair, but one thing all of the styles have in common is that
    they are big and hairsprayed. Perms were extremely common and curly
    hairstyles were very fashionable. Crimped hair was also popular –
    some stores still carry hair crimpers, if you want to try to look
    for
    one.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_6_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_6_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Style your hair with a curling iron or a hair crimper, then
        tease it to your desired size and shape. Hairspray your hair and
        then tease it a little more.
    -   Flip your head upside down and tease the underside of your hair
        to get even more volume. Finish it off with a healthy blast of
        hairspray.
    -   Try a side ponytail. Curl, tease and hairspray your ponytail and
        secure it with several scrunchies in different colors.
    -   If you have bangs, tease them as high as you can get them and
        secure with hairspray.
7.  Create the 80s makeup look. Loud, heavy makeup and neon colors were
    popular makeup styles in the 80s. Lips were usually pale and eye
    makeup was bright and emphasized dark, thick eyelashes with lots of
    eyeliner.[3]![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_7.jpg")
    -   Apply eyeshadow with a heavy hand. Bright, neon colors work just
        as well as dark, gothic colors.
    -   Line your top and bottom eyelids with thick black eyeliner,
        along with your water line.
    -   Finish it off with several coats of mascara and a light, frosty
        shade of lipstick or lip gloss.
    -   For real life makeup and hairstyle references, look up pictures
        of icons like Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, Molly Ringwald and Siouxsie
        Sioux.

### Dressing 1970s Retro

1.  Shape your outfit. The 1970s had several style movements, with the
    most remembered being a continuation of the 1960s bohemian look, the
    glittery androgyny of glam rock and the decadent disco fashion. The
    most popular silhouette of the decade was that of a tight-fitting
    top and loose-fitting
    bottom.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_8.jpg")
    -   For something more subtle, try a tight-fitting concert t-shirt
        and hip hugger jeans with canvas sneakers or tennis shoes.
    -   For a boho look, pair a flowing, gauzy top with a long maxi
        skirt. Mix-and-match earthy tones with ethnic prints.[4] Add a
        headband and delicate scarf for an instant 70s hippie look.
2.  Wear jeans with flared, bell bottom, or wide legs. Hip huggers and
    high-waisted jeans were also popular in the 70s. These styles
    sometimes come back into current fashion, so it’s entirely possible
    that you can find a new pair. You can also look for more authentic
    versions at thrift shops, probably with much cheaper price
    tags.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Jeans in the 70s often came decorated with embroidery,
        embellishments, and studs, so keep an eye out for those details.
3.  Accessorize with simple pieces made of natural materials. Thrift
    shops will be gold mines for these items. Look for jewelry made of
    wood, shells, stones, feathers, Indian beads and leather. Mix and
    match the pieces.[5] Add a big, floppy hat and large sunglasses as
    final
    touches.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Moccasin boots and Birkenstocks were the most popular shoes for
        the bohemian look. You could also try leather sandals or clogs.
    -   Fringe adorned everything – incorporate it in any way that you
        can.
4.  Try out the glam rock look. Glam rock clothing was flamboyant,
    brightly colored and made of fabrics like satin, velvet and spandex.
    Androgynous looks for both sexes were embraced and shiny fabrics in
    bright colors defined the
    era.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_11.jpg")
    -   Go for anything sequined, bedazzled, gemmed, tight-fitting and
        outrageously accentuated. Glittery items and otherworldly
        costumes are also ways to look glam.
    -   Accessorize with feather boas, giant sunglasses, and anything
        with leather and studs. Leather jackets, ascots, velvet coats
        and silk scarves all work great here.[6]
    -   Wear shiny, glittery, sequined or neon-colored tights with your
        ensemble.
5.  Go disco. Disco fashion was defined by glamour, eccentricity and
    decadence. Sequins and tight-fitting clothing could be found in
    every discotheque. Disco fashions were created with ease of movement
    in mind and included wrap-around skirts, leotards, tube tops, and
    dancewear-inspired dresses made of form-fitting fabrics like
    spandex.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Wear a sequined tube top with tight pants or short shorts.
        Spandex pieces in neon colors and anything that would glitter
        under dancefloor lights work perfectly.
    -   Pair a colorful leotard with a wrap-around skirt from a
        dancewear shop. Add anything else that is eye-catching and
        sparkly.
    -   Accessorize with huge, glittery costume jewelry pieces and knee
        high boots or very high heeled shoes (platforms if you can find
        them).
6.  Experiment with [1970s hairstyles](Do_70s_Hair "wikilink"). The main
    hairstyles of the 70s were feathered, shaggy or long with a center
    part. Try creating the wispy feathered hairstyle and spraying it
    with golden spray-on hair color (like the ones you see around
    Halloween) to get the frosted look so popular in the
    70s.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_13.jpg")
    -   If you have layers in your hair, spray it with dry shampoo to
        get volume and texture, then add a texturizing pomade to define
        your layers. Keep it a little messy.
    -   For those with long hair, simply part it down the middle and let
        it hang loose and free. Add a little product to make it shine.
7.  Create the 70s makeup look. Shimmer eye shadows were popular in
    every style and glitter trends in makeup were worn by both men and
    women. For glam or disco looks you can’t go wrong with brightly
    colored, highly glossed lips and “cat”
    eyeliner.[7]![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_14.jpg")
    -   Apply eyeshadow that is heavy, frosted, shimmery or glittery.
        Use plenty of black eyeliner and black mascara. If you want to
        go all-out, wear long false lashes.
    -   For the bohemian look, wear pale peach or pink lipstick, as they
        preferred a natural look.
    -   For real life 70s hair and makeup references, look up pictures
        of icons like Farrah Fawcett, Debbie Harry, Cher, Stevie Nicks,
        Bebe Buell, Shelley Duvall, David Bowie and Joni Mitchell.

### Dressing 1960s Retro

1.  Shape your outfit. The 60s decade was a time of major social and
    cultural change, and the trends of the 1960s reflected that. People
    were embracing a bohemian lifestyle and the Hippie Movement was
    born.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_15.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_15.jpg")
    -   To get the look that the hippies created, start thinking about
        theatrical costumes, recycled clothing, ethnic fashions, Indian
        prints, bright colors and mismatched patterns.
    -   Check out your nearest resale shop to look for vintage clothes
        and other items that you can repurpose, just like hippies did.
2.  Wear bell-bottom jeans and tie-dyed tops. Paisley prints and
    psychedelic prints are also great choices.[8] You can’t go wrong by
    pairing those two elements
    together.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_16.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_16.jpg")
    -   Jeans came in all colors of the rainbow and often featured
        embroidery or appliqued designs. Keep an eye out for those
        details or add them yourself.[9]
    -   Look for blouses with long and flowy "bubble" sleeves. Gauzy
        fabrics work great, too.
    -   Wear a simple chiffon baby-doll dress with spaghetti-straps for
        a feminine look.
3.  Go barefoot! Hippies frequently went barefoot, but sandals and
    flip-flops were also popular. If you have boots or clogs, those will
    also work
    perfectly.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_17.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_17.jpg")
4.  Put flowers in your hair. You could have fun with fresh flowers, but
    fake ones will work. Daisies were especially popular and they were
    often worn instead of jewelry. Weave the flowers flowers into your
    hair and secure them with bobby pins. Try a simple braid adorned
    with flowers or weave them into a wreath to wear on your head like a
    crown.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_18.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_18.jpg")
5.  Add some loose, flowing accessories made from natural materials.
    Gypsy scarves, flower headbands, and leather moccasins are all great
    options. Peace sign pendants, beaded jewelry, large rings, and chain
    belts will also work. You could also try stacked silver bangles,
    woven leather bracelets, and hooped
    earrings.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_19.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_19.jpg")
    -   Thrift stores will be gold mines for these items.
6.  Experiment with 1960s hairstyles. There was a wide variety of
    hairstyles in the 1960s, the most iconic being the very long,
    natural looking style that the hippies wore.[10] Part it down the
    middle and allow it to hang loose and
    free.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_20.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_20.jpg")
    -   If you don’t have long hair, check out wigs at your local
        costume shop. The beehive hairstyle was also very stylish.
7.  Create the 60s makeup look. The hippies usually went for a natural
    look and wore very little makeup. They did use face paint, however,
    especially for special events and festivals. Paint images of
    daisies, rainbows, and peace signs on your cheeks or forehead. Add
    some face glitter for a little
    sparkle.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_21.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_21.jpg")
    -   For those that did wear makeup, it was variable. However a pale
        mouth, large false eye lashes and exaggerated eye makeup will be
        instantly recognizable.
    -   For real life references of 60s makeup and hairstyles, look up
        pictures of icons like Twiggy, Brigitte Bardot, Janis Joplin,
        Edie Sedgewick, Jane Birkin and Marianne Faithfull.

### Dressing 1950s Retro

1.  Shape your outfit. Dresses were the most popular clothing items for
    women in the 1950s.[11] Soft shapes, defined waists, vibrant colors,
    and bold statements are all highly characteristic of women’s fashion
    during that decade. At the time, women and girls covered their legs
    so you could wear vintage seamed stockings in skin colour with
    suspenders to hold them up.
    [12]![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_22.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_22.jpg")
    -   A big emphasis was placed on looking glamorous, well-dressed and
        perfectly groomed every day.
2.  Wear a dress made of colorful printed fabric. Make sure the skirt
    goes falls slightly past your knee. Polka dots, gingham, florals,
    stripes, plaids and novelty themes (like science and western themes)
    are all great choices for the printed
    fabric.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_23.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_23.jpg")
    -   Halter sundresses, full skirts, and Peter Pan collars (flat
        collars that feature rounded ends that meet in the middle) are
        variations on the simple dress theme.
    -   Poodle skirts were a fleeting fad at the time, but now are
        iconic for many people when thinking of 50s fashion. Check your
        local costume shop for a big fluffy one.
    -   The pencil skirt was a fitted skirt that fell just below the
        knee. Pair one with a collared, button down dress shirt or a
        fitted sweater for another iconic 50s look.
3.  Accessorize with faux fur, gloves and large cat-eye shaped
    sunglasses.[13] Fur was extremely popular in the 1950s so try local
    resale shops for dresses and coats with faux fur-lined collars. Don
    a pair of white or cream colored gloves for the ultimate ladylike
    look of that
    time.[14]![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_24.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_24.jpg")
    -   Wear saddle shoes with socks for the poodle style. Otherwise,
        pair your dress with simple, tasteful heels.
4.  Experiment with 1950s hairstyles. For short hair, curl it tightly
    with a curling iron to get the iconic poodle cut look. For longer
    hair, make a big bouncy ponytail or create the ultra-glamorous (and
    time consuming) curled and pinned
    hairstyle.[15]![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_25.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_25.jpg")
    -   Regardless of the hairstyle you choose, definitely make sure you
        set it with plenty of hairspray before heading out.
5.  Create the 50s makeup look. Wear bright pink, orange or red
    lipsticks that coordinate with your outfit. Apply minimal eyeshadow
    and lots of mascara for a glamorous eye
    look.![](Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_26.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_(for_Girls)_Step_26.jpg")
    -   Cherry red nail polish was the most fashionable nail color at
        that time.[16]
    -   For real life 50s makeup and hairstyle references, look up
        pictures of icons like Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Donna
        Reed, Elizabeth Taylor and Betty Page.

## Tips

-   Raid your mom’s closet and hit your local thrift stores to score
    awesome and authentic retro pieces at affordable prices.
-   Don’t be afraid to mix and match styles and eras!
-   Unless you’re creating a Halloween costume, be choosy and moderate
    with your retro pieces. Shoulder pads and hugely teased bangs will
    (hopefully) not be making a comeback as everyday fashion statements.
-   Incorporating retro details and embellishments with a modern outfit
    can make a really trendy statement that doesn’t look overly vintage
    or outdated.
-   Just have fun with it! Retro fashion is intended to be a fun
    throwback that highlights the most memorable looks of an era – enjoy
    it!
