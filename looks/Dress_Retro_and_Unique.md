Dressing in a retro style is appealing to people of all ages. There are
lots of ways to incorporate retro and vintage inspired looks into your
wardrobe without sacrificing comfort or your own unique style. If you’re
interested in adding a retro flair to your personal style, start small
and work within your comfort zone. As you explore retro fashion, you
will discover what styles look good on you and how to adapt them to
represent your uniqueness.

## Steps

### Putting Outfits Together

1.  Raid your parents’ and grandparents’ closets for outfit ideas. Older
    family members can be great sources of inspiration for retro
    clothing. Even if the sizing of their clothing isn’t right for you,
    you can still get a lot of ideas about outfit combinations by
    looking through their
    wardrobes.![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   As you go through their items, pay attention to details, like
        patterns and cuts, that appear often and seem to represent
        certain eras.
    -   This knowledge can be helpful as you search thrift stores and
        vintage shops for retro clothing.
2.  Look at old pictures for fashion inspiration. Ask to see old
    pictures of your parents or grandparents and evaluate the styles you
    see. Even better, look through their school yearbooks. These will
    give you accurate examples of what young people of that particular
    era really
    wore.![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Look for archived fashion photography online for additional
        inspiration.
    -   Explore a variety of eras and get a feel for how to capture them
        accurately.
3.  Mix and match styles and eras.[1] One of the easiest ways to start
    working retro fashion into your wardrobe is by mixing vintage pieces
    with modern ones. For example, you could pair a retro 50s top with
    jeans you already own and a pair of 60s-era ballet flats or vintage
    sneakers from the 70s. Experiment with different combinations, but
    try to choose an element that will unify the ensemble in some way.
    For instance, the repetition of a particular color or pattern can
    make an outfit look
    cohesive.![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Sometimes an outfit that doesn’t seem like it would make sense
        at all can end up looking fantastic once you have it on.
    -   Head-to-toe retro or wearing too much of a particular decade can
        sometimes make you look like you’re wearing a costume. Mixing
        and matching eras can help you avoid that.
4.  Choose statement pieces.[2] Find a few items that are timeless and
    classic for a particular era, then build your outfits on top of
    them. When choosing staple pieces, pick items that you fit you well
    and look natural on you. Since you’ll be wearing them often, choose
    quality garments that can withstand a bit of extra
    wear.![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Good examples of classic staple pieces are a 50s beaded
        cardigan, a 60s little black dress, 70s polyester trousers,
        vintage sneakers from the 80s and so on.
    -   Select timeless pieces that reflect your own personal style.
5.  Add flair with retro accessories. Look for retro or retro-inspired
    jewelry to accent your outfits. As with the clothing, don’t be
    afraid to mix and match accessories. Look for colorful bangles,
    headbands, pearls, vintage looking necklaces and dangly earrings.
    Depending on what era you want to reflect, you could also try
    feather boas, anything with fringe, lace shawls, cat-eye sunglasses,
    faux fur, gloves, beaded jewelry, large rings, gypsy scarves and a
    lot
    more.![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Thrift shops will offer many options to choose from. Experiment
        with different combinations and find what suits you.
    -   If you’re trying to ease your way into the retro style,
        accessories are a great place to start.
6.  Keep your hairstyle and makeup modern. Unfortunately, wearing
    head-to-toe vintage and topping that off with a retro haircut and
    makeup can sometimes make you look like you're wearing a Halloween
    costume. If you're concerned about your retro outfits looking too
    much like costumes, you can prevent this by keeping your hairstyle
    and makeup
    modern.![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_6_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_6_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Your unique style is also better preserved when you keep these
        elements up-to-date.

### Developing Your Own Style

1.  Select pieces that reflect your personality.[3] Think about your
    previous favorite looks and clothing styles, then look for retro
    equivalents. Have you always gravitated toward simple pieces or do
    you prefer to be avant-garde with your style? Do you tend to wear
    dressy or casual items? Do you like sharp, clean lines or loose and
    flowing ones? Patterns or solids? Every era has a vast array of
    styles – there is no “one” look for any decade. You can find
    something that represents your personality in any of
    them!![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_7_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_7_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Stay true to what feels natural to you. You should feel like
        yourself in whatever you’re wearing, not like someone playing
        dress up.
    -   Choose items that appeal to you rather than selecting pieces
        just because they "look retro."
2.  Choose pieces that flatter your body shape.[4] Some retro items are
    going to look better on you than others. Experiment with anything
    that catches your eye, but whenever you find something that works
    really well for you, look for other items similar to it. For
    example, if you discover that loose and flowing 60s blouses look
    great on you, you could search for similar styles in different
    colors and other
    cuts.![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_8_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_8_Version_3.jpg")
    -   As you discover additional pieces that are flattering, continue
        to add to your retro wardrobe and develop your own unique style.
    -   Select vintage pieces that fit you well and highlight your best
        features.[5]
    -   Whenever possible, try on a garment before buying it. Don’t be
        afraid to alter pieces that you really like so that they fit you
        perfectly.[6]
3.  Add vintage embellishments to your modern pieces. Instead of
    revamping your entire style and replacing your entire wardrobe,
    think about adding retro touches to clothing you already own. Try
    adding patches to your jeans, changing the buttons on a shirt,
    embellishing a jacket with fringe and so on. Get
    creative!![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_9_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_9_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Try repurposing some of your current clothing with retro
        elements bought from a thrift store. For instance, you could sew
        a 60s style shirt collar onto a top you already own.
    -   Give a modern outfit a little retro flair by adding vintage
        accessories to go with it.

### Building a Vintage Wardrobe

1.  Check out thrift stores and charity shops. The best local resources
    for retro clothing are thrift shops, Salvation Army stores and
    resale shops.[7] These places also have the lowest prices, but a
    little digging is usually required to unearth quality items. Don’t
    be overwhelmed by the massive selection, but be prepared to really
    dig in. Move boxes around, look under things and pull out clothing
    from the bottom of the bins. You never know what you might
    find!![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Check the glass cabinets near the registers, as well. These are
        generally locked, and for good reason – the best things are
        often in them.
    -   Find out from store management how often they replenish their
        stock and check back frequently.[8]
2.  Shop at dedicated boutiques and antique shops.[9] Boutiques that
    specialize in retro and vintage clothing can be excellent resources
    for building your wardrobe. The same is true for antique shops. The
    selection is often much better and less digging is required to find
    the good stuff. Unfortunately, you can also expect the price tags to
    be higher than what you’d find at a thrift shop. If you’re
    considering making a significant purchase at a boutique, ask the
    shop assistant to go over the details of the piece with
    you.![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_11.jpg")
    -   If a garment is very expensive, look for designer tags. If it’s
        not a designer piece, ask about the price.
    -   Don’t make a purchase unless you are completely satisfied with
        what they have to say.
3.  Assess the condition of used clothing.[10] Always run your hand over
    the fabrics to check their condition before you make a purchase.
    Look for holes and stains. You can’t expect perfection from used
    items and signs of wear should be expected. However, don’t let a
    minor defect stop you from buying a piece you really love. Evaluate
    any flaws you find realistically. Sometimes garments can be dry
    cleaned or repaired, but not
    always.![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Think about the size of the defect, where it’s located on the
        item, and whether or not it’s still wearable if you can’t fix
        it.
    -   In general, the older a garment is, the more fragile the
        material will be.
    -   Moth damage is a risk, especially with natural fibers. Hold
        pieces up to the light to look for threadbare fabric and holes.
4.  Shop for vintage items online.[11] Local thrift shops can only offer
    so much in the form of quality retro pieces. Websites like eBay and
    Etsy can provide a vast selection of additional items that would be
    difficult to find in a resale shop. The downside is that you can’t
    touch the fabric or evaluate the size before you buy something
    online. Inspect the images closely. If you aren’t satisfied with the
    provided images, request additional ones from the
    seller.![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Online retailers should provide measurements. Don’t rely on the
        size identified on the tag.[12]
    -   Make sure details are provided about any damages or
        irregularities.
    -   Find out the seller’s return policy and keep that in mind when
        making decisions. Often, sales are final.[13]
5.  Be aware of sizing differences.[14] The sizing systems for vintage
    clothing are generally not identical to modern sizing systems. Sizes
    can vary from decade to decade, and also by manufacturer.[15]
    Because of this, it can be difficult to figure out if something will
    fit you just by looking at it. Do a little research on basic sizing
    systems for the eras you’re interested
    in.![](Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress_Retro_and_Unique_Step_14.jpg")
    -   When in doubt, go for pieces that appear slightly too large.
        These can always be tailored to fit you just right, but there
        isn’t much you can do with a garment that is too small for
        you.[16]
