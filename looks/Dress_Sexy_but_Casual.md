Everyone wants to feel sexy from time to time. If you're looking to
create that effortlessly sexy and casual look, there are a few steps you
can take to get you on the right path. Once you've mastered the wardrobe
and the attitude of a casual, sexy dresser, you'll be turning heads
everywhere you go.

## Steps

### Revamping Your Wardrobe

1.  Show off your shape. Wearing figure flattering clothing is the key
    to enhancing your sex appeal. Don't hide your shape with baggy
    clothing, but don't squeeze your body into extremely tight clothing
    either. Everyone has their own unique assets, so choose the clothes
    that best accentuate
    yours.![](Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_2_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_2_Version_4.jpg")
    -   If you think your arms are sexy, fill your closet with
        sleeveless tops. If you love the way your back looks, buy some
        tops and dresses that have open backs. If your legs are your
        favorite body part, short skirts and dresses should fill your
        closet.
    -   Replace bulky sweaters with slimming dark colored turtlenecks,
        replace looser skirts with tight pencil skirts, replace baggy
        t-shirts with tight v-necks. Though these changes are subtle,
        they'll give you the casual, sexy look you're going for.
2.  Combine your casual clothing with sexier pieces. Creating a balance
    between sexy and casual is all about mixing up lengths, styles, and
    fits. You can wear things that drape for a casual look combined with
    something tight to add a bit of sex appeal, or you can show off your
    legs with a sexy skirt while wearing a more modest
    top.![](Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_1_Version_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_1_Version_5.jpg")
    -   Combine a short bottom, such as a mini shirt, with a turtleneck
        or long sleeved top.
    -   Pair a low cut or open back shirt with a fashionable pair of
        wide-leg pants.
    -   Throw on those jeans that accentuate your curves with a flowy
        top. You can also belt the top to show off your waist.
    -   Add textures like lace and leather to your look. Black pants are
        sexier when they're black leather pants. A lace top will allow
        you to subtly show some skin while still looking relaxed and
        casual.[1]
3.  Find the right size. Wearing clothing that is too big or too small
    is rarely figure flattering, and can draw attention to all the wrong
    areas. If you're unsure of your proper size, ask a salesperson for
    help when you're out purchasing your new, sexy
    wardrobe.[2]![](Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_3_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_3_Version_4.jpg")
4.  Leave something to the imagination. There's a common misconception
    that showing more skin is equal to being sexy. There's absolutely
    nothing wrong with loving your body, but showing a lot of skin can
    come off as trying too hard, especially in a casual environment.
    Instead, wear clothing that shows off your figure but still leaves
    some of your body to the
    imagination.[3]![](Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_4_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_4_Version_4.jpg")
    -   Wear a long sleeved knee length body glove dress. You'll be all
        covered up, but you'll still be showing off your shape.
    -   Wear high waisted pants with a cropped, flowy top. You'll get to
        show off your legs and hips without showing tons of skin.
5.  Wear more red. The red effect is very real, and has been proven time
    and again in studies. Researchers have learned that there are
    several biological factors that actually make women appear more
    attractive to men when wearing red and that women perceive men as
    being more dominant when wearing red. So yes, wearing red will
    scientifically make you sexier, even if it's something as casual as
    an oversized
    sweater.[4]![](Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_5_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_5_Version_4.jpg")
6.  Get rid of your old, boring clothing. If you've been wearing the
    same old clothing for years, giving your closet a makeover is the
    perfect way to add some sex appeal to your wardrobe. Get rid of the
    clothes that don't make you feel great and replace them with new
    pieces that you find sexy. If you've been wanting your very own
    little black dress, now's the time to get one! If you're sick of
    wearing the same boring suit to work, change it up with a bold color
    or different
    design.[5]![](Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_6_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_6_Version_4.jpg")
    -   Wearing old clothing doesn't feel fresh or exciting. Being
        excited about what you're wearing will give you a boost of
        confidence, and confidence is always sexy. A new pair of jeans
        that fit you like a glove will make you feel sexier than the old
        pair that don't seem to be as flattering as they once were.
7.  Study fashion blogs and magazines for inspiration. When changing
    your wardrobe, you may need a bit of guidance to point you in the
    right direction. Looking through fashion blogs and magazines can
    help you find the sexy, casual look you're going for and teach you
    how to put your ideal outfits
    together.![](Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_7_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_7_Version_4.jpg")
    -   Create a Pinterest board of casual outfits you find sexy. Look
        for the trends you see on your Pinterest board and add those
        items to your closet. If your Pinterest board is showing a lot
        of pumps, it's time to add some pumps to your shoe collection.
        If your Pinterest board is filled with distressed jeans, then
        get yourself a few pairs of new denim.
    -   Study how your favorite sexy, yet causal outfits are put
        together and copy them. Mastering the art of a sexy, yet casual
        look is all about balance. Pair a sexy top with casual pants, or
        give a t-shirt and jeans some sex appeal with 5 inch high
        heels.[6]

### Carrying Yourself with Confidence

1.  Be confident in yourself. If you feel sexy, then you'll look sexy.
    If you don't feel sexy, that will show as well. Confidence is one of
    the sexiest ways to spice up your outfit, so own it! Pair your sexy
    new clothing with a confident attitude, and your sex appeal will be
    undeniable.[7]![](Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_8_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_8_Version_3.jpg")
2.  Take care of your personal hygiene. Your sexy, casual look will be
    incomplete without the proper hygiene, so create a beauty routine to
    go with your new
    wardrobe.![](Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
    -   The right haircut and hairstyle can make or break your casual,
        sexy look. Whether you prefer the messy, natural look or a
        simple, refined bun, choose a hairstyle that makes you feel
        sexy. If you're running around town in black pants and a
        sweater, add a bit of sexy to your look with big, bouncy curls.
        If you're wearing a short dress, sweeten the look with a
        half-ponytail or a bun. It's all about balancing sexy and casual
        looks.[8]
    -   Brush and floss to illuminate your smile. A beautiful smile is
        always sexy, so be sure to take good care of your mouth. Clean,
        white teeth will also add to your confidence, and we already
        know that confidence is key.
    -   Take care of your skin. Use face wash to keep your face looking
        fresh, and keep your skin soft with your favorite lotion. If
        you're showing a bit more skin, it's important to make sure that
        skin looks great.
3.  Enhance your look with the right makeup and fragrance. The right
    makeup and fragrance will transform a nice outfit into a sexy
    outfit. Appealing to multiple senses – sight and smell – will take
    your look to the next
    level.![](Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Makeup is a great way to complete your look. However, if you're
        going for the casual, sexy look, keep your makeup on the lighter
        side. For example, if you're wearing eyeliner, go with a nude
        lip or lip gloss. If you're not big on eye makeup, give your lip
        a splash of color with red lipstick. These techniques will make
        you look effortlessly sexy.
    -   Pick a personal fragrance that you love. The perfect finish to
        an outfit is your favorite perfume or cologne. Lightly spritz
        yourself before you head out to add a bit of extra sex appeal to
        your look.
4.  Don't try too hard. Trying to be somebody you're not is never a good
    idea, and it's obvious to others. Instead of trying to change
    yourself, embrace what's naturally sexy about you. The more
    comfortable you appear, the sexier you'll look – no matter how
    casual your outfit
    is.![](Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_11_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Sexy_but_Casual_Step_11_Version_3.jpg")
    -   If you're not a dress girl, you don't have to wear dresses to be
        sexy. Instead, throw on some figure flattering pants with a
        low-cut top, or a crop top, and step out with confidence.
    -   For men who don't like to dress up, pair a blazer with
        sweatpants for a casual, sexy, and trendy look. You'll be
        comfortable *and* look great.
