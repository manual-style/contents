Dressing “smart casual” is another way to say dressing stylish casual.
Dressing smart casual essentially means dressing in a casual manner that
is a bit more fancy by creating a neat, fashionable, and accessorized
outfit. Dressing smart casual can sometimes be a challenge, however
there are some simple tips you can keep in mind when planning your
outfit.

## Steps

### Creating a Smart Ensemble

1.  Think about what bottoms to wear. For a smart casual outfit, you
    must balance flairs of professionalism and fashion.[1] Consider
    wearing bottoms that are comfortable but sharp looking; they need to
    be able to pull through a professional yet casual look. For example,
    a nice pair of slacks, darker-colored conservative skirts, and even
    a dark wash pair of jeans can all be appropriate bottoms for a smart
    casual outfit.[2] Most times, your bottoms can act as a base from
    which you create your ensemble
    outfit.![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Your bottoms can absolutely incorporate a pop of color. You
        could wear something like a brown or dark green skirt, navy blue
        slacks, or a dark, indigo wash pair of jeans.
    -   If you decide to wear a skirt, it must be a business appropriate
        length (at least to the top of your knees).
    -   However, keep in mind that if your bottoms include color and are
        more fashionable, you should try to balance your outfit with a
        milder, yet chic top.
2.  Pair your bottoms with an appropriate top. Since smart casual is all
    about balancing, your top must equalize your outfit. If your bottoms
    are dressier, your top can be more casual (ruffles, color, accents,
    prints, etc.). If your bottoms are more casual, dress up your outfit
    by sporting a sleeker, more professional
    top.![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   A professional top would be a button-down shirt, a dressy
        blouse, or a collared top.[3]
    -   Again, your top can incorporate color, it just has to stabilize
        out your outfit. If your bottoms are a muted color, opt for a
        colored shirt.[4] If your bottoms are the outfit piece adding
        color, wear a more neutral top.
3.  Wear a dress. Wearing a dress is a safe choice if you are trying to
    dress smart casual. A dress immediately elevates the “dressiness” of
    your outfit, but the print or material of the dress can add a needed
    casual element. No matter what kind of dress you choose to wear, the
    hem of the dress should reach at least the top of your knees.[5] If
    you have a professional looking dress (conservative length, darker
    color), you can dress it down by pairing it with casual accessories
    like a colored scarf or simple, yet stylish
    jewelry.![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Vice versa, if you have a more casual dress, you can spruce up
        the look by pairing it with stylish and conservative heels and
        simple, clean cut jewelry.
    -   When wearing a dress for a smart casual outfit, choose to keep
        it simple. When in doubt, you rather your outfit come off as
        more dressy than casual.[6]
4.  Add a blazer. A blazer is a great outfit piece that can add a
    professional tone to your outfit, but still keep it casual when
    paired with a softer top.[7] If you’re considering wearing a blazer,
    make sure it has a fitted cut. This tailored piece can make your
    outfit look a bit more put together, while your other clothing items
    channel the more casual side of your
    ensemble.![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   A plain black or navy blue blazer can incorporate a more
        professional feel, while a colored blazer can add in a pop of
        color as an accent piece.
5.  Slip on appropriate shoes. For a smart casual outfit, consider
    finishing your ensemble with a comfortable pair of dress shoes.
    Heels work great, and close-toed pumps are always a safe choice to
    complete your look.[8] Flats can also be an option if you want to go
    for a more casual
    look.![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_5.jpg")
    -   You can make your outfit stand out while maintaining a casual
        look by having your flats be a main fashion statement. They can
        be colored or patterned, but it must balance out your outfit of
        mainly neutral, composed pieces.
    -   Wedges and some opened toed shoes can also work for a smart
        casual outfit if you are attending a more casual event. However,
        if you are dressing for work, stay away from these
        options.[9][10]
    -   Avoid wearing sandals with a smart casual outfit; sandals are
        plain casual.

### Accessorizing Your Outfit

1.  Wear suitable jewelry. Accessories are often the outfit pieces that
    can firmly establish the feel of your ensemble. They can
    dramatically push an outfit toward being more “smart,” or more
    casual. For example, statement necklaces are usually go-to pieces of
    jewelry that can liven up and dress up a plainer outfit. They can
    include color and act as an accent to an otherwise muted
    outfit.![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_6.jpg")
    -   This same principle goes for earrings. You still want your
        earrings to be simple, but they can add some flair and elevate
        to your outfit.
    -   If your outfit is already a bit varied with colors and prints,
        consider toning down to jewelry to balance your look out.
2.  Wear a belt. Accessorizing your outfit with a belt can add a pop of
    color to your look, function as a statement piece, or add a bit of
    texture to your outfit. For example, if your outfit consists of
    mostly matte fabrics, you can wear a patterned or patent belt to
    make your ensemble a bit more interesting and add a little
    variety.[11] Depending on what kind of belt you use, incorporating
    one into your outfit can make your look more fun and fashionable (if
    the belt is colored), or more put together and smart (if the belt is
    more
    modest).![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_7.jpg")
    -   Thin belts tend to look really nice with dresses, and wide belts
        can pair well with longer skirts.[12]
3.  Sport a watch. Wearing a watch may bleed over into jewelry
    territory, but it can be a separate accessory in it’s own right. Try
    to pick a watch that is simple, yet can make a statement. For
    example, a watch with a slightly bigger face, but a simple band can
    make a great accessory addition. Or, if your watch is going to have
    a bit more color in the band, make sure the face of the watch isn’t
    so big and
    bold.![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_8.jpg")
    -   Another thing to consider is the material of the watch. Your
        watch should be some sort of metal (silver, gold, platinum), but
        the metal color should go with the other metal pieces in your
        outfit.
    -   For example, if your shoes and purse have gold detailing, avoid
        wearing a silver colored watch.
4.  Carry a purse. A colorful or unique purse can act as a statement
    piece to a calmer, more conservative outfit. Conversely, a stylish
    and simple bag can elevate a more casual outfit. Your purse does not
    have to match your outfit, but if you already have a color piece in
    your ensemble (top, blazer, shoes, etc.), you might want to keep
    your purse color on the more reserved
    side.![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Any purse that you use should be sleek and fashionable, no
        matter which way your outfit is leaning toward. For example, if
        you purse if smaller, it could be a bit more playful and flashy
        when paired with a casual outfit. If your purse is bigger, keep
        it simple and modest when paired with a more colorful outfit.
5.  Consider wearing a scarf. A scarf can serve as a simple accessory
    that can add a little variety to your outfit.[13] You don’t want the
    scarf to overpower your outfit, but enhance it in a small way. A
    scarf can always add a bit of color to your outfit, while sometimes
    lending a more fashionable feel, depending on the print and
    fabric.![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_10.jpg")
    -   If your outfit consists of mainly dark colors, consider pairing
        it with a graphic scarf.

### Incorporating Your Own Style

1.  Wear your favorite print or color. For business suits, the classic
    attire can be rather boring. Consider switching up your business
    look by wearing a blouse that is your favorite print of color.
    Adding in this variety can keep your outfit looking appropriate and
    smart, while also letting your personal fashion sense shine
    through.[14]![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_11.jpg")
2.  Soften your look with a sweater. Blazers are a great way to
    embellish a smart casual outfit, but if you want to go for a softer
    look, consider wearing a colorful cardigan or wrap sweater.[15] The
    color of the cardigan can be a statement color, or it can be an
    accent color to an otherwise muted-toned
    outfit.![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_12.jpg")
    -   If you are always chilly, a turtleneck is also a viable option
        for a smart casual sweater look.
3.  Renovate your work basics. In many business settings, pantsuits are
    a norm. Switch up the norm by updating your normal pantsuits for
    ones with slimmer silhouettes. Slimmer silhouettes can flatter your
    figure while staying modest, and you can mix and match your pantsuit
    combinations.[16]![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_13.jpg")
4.  Always wear at least one statement piece. Dressing stylish everyday
    might be exhausting, but when in doubt (and running low on work
    appropriate outfits) always wear at least one statement piece.[17]
    That means, if your dress is going to be pretty boring for the day,
    make sure your shoes, or you necklace, or your belt is making a
    fashion
    statement.![](Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress_Smart_Casual_(Females)_Step_14.jpg")
    -   Your statement piece could be colorful, or printed, or
        embellished. This is the easiest way to make sure your outfit is
        incorporating the “smart” part of smart casual.
