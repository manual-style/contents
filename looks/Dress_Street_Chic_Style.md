Dressing street chic isn't as hard as it seems. though some people look
effortlessly chic every single day, once you know the basic guidelines
for dressing, being street chic can be a reality.

## Steps

1.  Cultivate your own sense of aesthetic. Everyone is unique, and
    therefore, everyone has diverse tastes. Know what you like in music,
    literature, movies and art. Incorporate these things into your
    style. To cultivate this, immerse yourself in different genres and
    be open minded to different
    people.![](Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Know what colors look good on you. Most people are easily classified
    into seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter) depending on their
    skin color, with the variations depending on one's hair and eye
    color. To figure out which color type you are and which colors look
    good on you go to

    Once you got that figured out, wear these colors all the
    time.![](Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Learn about proportion. The key to being street chic is balance. If
    you're wearing a loose top, pair it with a tight bottom. If you're
    wearing something baggy on the bottom, go with a lean shirt. The
    same goes for shoes. Chunky heels look out of proportion on petite
    girls, while stiletto heels look weird on girls with chunky calves.
    This also applies to showing skin. Only flaunt one part of you body.
    you want to look chic, not trashy (unless that's the look your going
    for).![](Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Go shopping. If you don't want to look like everyone else at your
    school, avoid your local mall. don't shop at Abercrombie, AE,
    Hollister, etc. instead, go to little thrift shops around your area
    to look for cheap, one-of-a-kind clothing. Always buy your size. It
    doesn't matter whether you're a size 0 or 10, nobody will know your
    real size unless you tell them, so better buy your
    size.![](Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Get the basics. And by basics- I mean oversized v-necked tees in
    basic colors, oversized cardigans, a great fitting and flattering
    pair of jeans in a dark wash, black tights, a skirt in a silhouette
    that flatters your shape, knit tank tops in basic color you can
    layer, and a great pair of leather or suede boots and a good coat
    for winter and cute flats for summer. Once you get these basics, you
    can mix, match and layer them to create a variety of
    looks.![](Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Don't forget what's underneath. Always buy quality underwear in your
    size and basic colors like black and nude. You should have seamless
    knickers too in these colors. Wear the black one under dark colored
    clothing, the nude one under the light colored
    ones.![](Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Accessorize! Necklaces, bracelets, rings, belts, bags, scarves and
    headgear. Pick whatever you like. There are lots of stores with
    different styles to suit your taste. These things make a basic
    outfit look stunning. When done right, accessorizing can be your
    best technique into looking street chic. Layer them if you
    like.![](Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Choose a point of fashion. As in, 'Today, I'm an 80's raver' or
    'Alice in Wonderland' or whatever. Be creative, be whimsical and
    have
    fun!![](Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Street_Chic_Style_Step_8.jpg")
