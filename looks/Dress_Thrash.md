Are you a fan of thrash metal? If you are, perhaps you want to represent
the style in public. You can't really do that without the thrash
uniform.

## Steps

1.  Obtain band T-shirts. Black is generally the color most associated
    with metal fashion, thrash is no exception. A local metal shop would
    be your best bet. If you don't know any, try the internet, more
    unique shirts can be found there. Aim for thrash shirts, death and
    black would also suffice if you listen to these genres. Don't limit
    yourself to band shirts
    only.![](Dress_Thrash_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Thrash_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Get some skinny denim jeans. These can be found at any store that
    sells regular ones. Aim for any shade of blue or black. Ripped ones
    are also very good. Also remember, if aiming for anything
    denim-made, more expensive isn't really better. Try finding a bullet
    belt to fit with the
    jeans.![](Dress_Thrash_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Thrash_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Get some hi-top sport shoes. Reebok, Nike or Adidas, or any other
    more-specialized brand can offer really good ones. White ones are
    greatly preferred. Major decorations, paintings and such are not
    advised. If you can't really find shoes like these, an alternative
    could be some
    converse.![](Dress_Thrash_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Thrash_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Make a kutte. A kutte is a denim vest with patches, and more rarely
    in the metal world, decorations like spikes and studs. Its not too
    hard to make one. Go to a second hand store and buy a denim jacket
    that fits you, or buy a non-used one if you want to. Your next step
    would be to cut out the sleeves. Now you should obtain some band
    patches. Look for these in local metal shops or in websites. Get a
    long one for the are just below your shoulders. Get a big back patch
    for the back, and small ones to fill the rest of the space. Decorate
    it with studs and spikes if you feel like
    it.![](Dress_Thrash_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Thrash_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Studded bracelets, necklaces and such. These are
    welcome.![](Dress_Thrash_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Thrash_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Grow your hair out. This is optional, though you will rarely find a
    thrasher with short hair. Facial hair is also optional, though a
    beard never really killed
    anyone.![](Dress_Thrash_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Thrash_Step_6.jpg")

## Tips

-   White hi-tops are THE thrash shoe.
-   Don't limit yourself to band shirts. Also, don't limit yourself to
    BLACK shirts. Gray and white are good alternatives if you can't
    really find something black.
-   Using a backpatch/long patch for the back is not really mandatory.
    You could fill up the space with smaller patches.
-   Second hand store denim jackets/vests are preferred. The reason for
    this, is that the denim is already broken-in.
-   Talk to people about it. You never know if some one of your parents
    or some of their friends had an interest in metal when they were
    younger, you may get some older, more valuable stuff this way.

## Warnings

-   Don't be a poseur. Don't dress thrash just for the social
    acceptance, this could get you in trouble, and for god's sake, don't
    dress in a way that is uncomfortable for you.
-   NEVER wash a kutte. This could ruin the patches/any autographs on
    it.
-   Don't expect much compliments on your attire from people outside the
    metal community. Thrash fashion isn't mainstream.

-   A good taste in music
