Are you interested in being Visual Kei? It's an intriguing, individual
style which has been becoming more popular over the last few years,
though it still isn't widely known about. If you're already interested
in Punk, Goth or the Japanese street fashion scene and you like the
music, you're perfect for the look!

## Steps

1.  Find a store that sells Visual Kei clothing. There are plenty of
    online stores that sell Visual clothing - but beware of bad quality
    clothes, check the store reviews first! If there's one near you, you
    might be able to find great accessories in Hot Topic or another
    "alternative" shop like
    it.![](Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Dark clothing is always in fashion! Lots of Visual Kei stars dress
    in neons and loud colours and patterns, so don't feel that you can
    never wear bright colours again (quite the opposite!) but a
    monochrome outfit, or an outfit mostly made of black pieces with a
    splash of a bright colour like red, blue or orange as an accent
    nearly always looks stylish and pulled
    together.![](Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Plaid, stripes, lace, webbed patterns and skull motifs are very
    popular. But Visual Kei is a very anything-goes fashion so long as
    it keeps to the 'cool punk' feel of the look. Plaid skirts or plaid
    patches on tops are very cute for girly Visual Kei wearers! Stripy
    tops, either horizontal or vertical, are stylish and versatile for
    any look, so it's always worth having one. Lace is more often
    connected with the Lolita subculture, but it can add some really
    interesting texture to a Visual-kei outfit, so long as it isn't
    cheap and scratchy. Cobweb fabrics are also very cool - it's dark,
    spooky and reminiscent of the very sought-after brand Alice Auaa's
    signature cobweb material. You don't have to limit yourself to just
    these, either - as well as skulls, crowns and crosses, anything with
    a spooky, grotesque, or OTT adorable look to it, depending on your
    outfit, will work really
    well.![](Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Wear your clothes loose enough to move around comfortably in.
    Although skinny jeans never go out of style in Visual Kei, make sure
    you have enough freedom of movement to dance! Your top or T-shirt
    shouldn't be tight either, especially if your trousers are tight
    too; the up-and-down fitted look isn't really a part of the fashion.
    Don't make it so baggy that it looks like it doesn't fit you unless
    it's actually meant to look that way,
    though.![](Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Don't be afraid to mix and match different styles! Visual Kei
    borrows hugely from all kinds of other fashions like western Goth
    and Punk, Lolita and historical fashion, so if you have the basics
    of both styles down and you're confident about making it look good,
    go for it. How about, for instance, mixing a poofy knee-length plaid
    skirt with a distressed tank top, platform heels and spiky hair for
    a great Visual Kei Lolita
    look?![](Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Your clothes might be the outfit, but it's definitely your
    accessories that make it. Necklaces, bracelets, studs, chains and
    belts are all musts for any outfit - even if you're going for a
    simple look, don't skimp on at least a punky belt and a few rings to
    pull it all
    together.![](Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Any shoes that aren't too casual or pretty will go with your outfit!
    Creepers, platform boots, Doc Martens, winklepickers and engineer
    boots are all popular choices. For an extra bit of flair, how about
    wrapping a few chain bracelets around the ankles of your
    boots?![](Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Dyed hair is always great! If your hair is already a nice colour
    naturally, or has a great style then it doesn't really need it, but
    dyeing your hair is fun and makes it that much easier to make your
    style more polished-looking. Any crazy colour will go down a storm,
    but it doesn't need to be unnatural; silver, ash blond, dark brown
    and black are all seen just as much as bright pink or blue. But if
    you really can't decide on a single colour, how about a split a la
    Waka from Danger
    Gang?![](Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Makeup isn't necessary but it's still one of the biggest parts of
    the style. Especially if you're after a more modern or, for females,
    androgynous look then you can give it a miss or just go for simple
    concealer, matte powder and eyeliner - but it's always cool to at
    least know how to dress it up for special occasions. Look for makeup
    tutorials and collect lots of pictures of Visual Kei musicians to
    see how they do
    it!![](Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_9.jpg")
10. It's very rare to see a Visual Kei musician without any piercings.
    Nose and septum piercings, lip piercings and tongue piercings are
    all cool, as are any kind of ear piercings. If you don't want to get
    something permanent done, your work won't let you, or you're too
    young but you'd still like to have some metalwork, try buying some
    fake piercings. They're cheap and easily available on sites like
    eBay.![](Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_10.jpg")
11. This is the most important thing to remember. No matter what you're
    aiming for, Visual Kei is always very carefully coordinated and
    pulled together. It has to look completely polished and intentional
    even when it's all ripped up and distressed - that's what separates
    it from other styles like emo, scene, punk or western goth. If your
    coordination skills aren't great, just start simple with a few
    outfits made of items like kilts, skinny jeans, printed tops and
    cardigans or blazers and a few accessories. Build it up slowly until
    you feel more confident about complicated outfits. If you don't feel
    like you can spend hours every day on your hair and makeup, get a
    low-maintenance, good-looking hair style like a thick mohawk, short
    hime cut or an undercut that can be drawn up into a teased ponytail,
    and keep up a good skin
    routine.![](Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_11.jpg")
12. It doesn't matter what people think of you. If you're going into a
    dangerous area it probably isn't sensible to dress up and draw
    attention to yourself, but otherwise, try learning to ignore any
    stares or comments. You look damn cool, so believe
    it!![](Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_12.jpg")
13. Have fun! Visual Kei is often a bit self-mocking, especially when
    it's especially gloomy or angsty, so don't feel like you have to be
    extremely serious about
    it.![](Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_Visual_Kei_Step_13.jpg")

## Tips

-   Coloured contacts are an amazing addition to an outfit. They're not
    necessary by any means, nor are they recommended for everyday wear,
    but if you're going somewhere special then a matching pair of
    contacts or circle lenses can be an incredible final touch.
-   Buy pieces that you know will be versatile. There's no point
    spending three week's spending money on a jacket or a pair of boots
    that will only go with one outfit you own. Even worse, don't get
    pieces that require you to buy other things to go with them unless
    you can afford it, or are actually building your wardrobe up!
-   You'll rarely catch a Visual Kei musician wearing anything plain,
    but especially if you live far from a big alternative scene it can
    be hard to get cool clothes. So if you spot a tee with a great print
    but a boring design, or a jacket that has a neat cut but is bland
    and dull, don't be scared to modify them - a band tee can be made
    into a great tank by cutting off the sleeves, slitting the side
    seams up and punching holes in the sides to lace them up instead. A
    boring jacket can be greatly improved by sewing some faux fur to the
    collar and glueing some pyramid studs to the lapels. Remember, every
    thing you modify or make yourself is one piece that is completely
    unique. Nobody else has one like it!
-   You can always find good things in the shops around you. Don't turn
    your nose up at something just because it wasn't from Japan - lots
    of shirts, tops, ties and other basic pieces can be found on your
    local high street. Don't be scared to go into the other gender's
    clothing range, or the children's clothes if you can fit them, and
    browse there either! If you're especially embarrassed and anyone
    asks (though it's incredibly rare anyone would), just tell them
    you're buying for someone else.
-   Lots of the brand items that are really sought after in the fashion,
    like pieces by h. Naoto, Sex Pot Revenge or Alice Auaa, are quite
    expensive. Try buying them second-hand from sales communities like
    egl_comm_sales or vk_sales on Livejournal.

## Warnings

-   Be aware of looking too 'anime fan'-ish. Cosplayish kinds of
    accessories like cheap legwarmers and armwarmers, animal ears and
    bondage gear or black lipstick are the kind of thing you might want
    to leave well alone until you're sure you know how to make them look
    good.
-   If you're going after this for an everyday look, you might want to
    try the more modern, toned-down styles of Visual Kei like those
    currently worn by Miyavi, D'espairs Ray and L'arc\~en\~Ciel - even
    though it's super fun to dress to the nines, it's best saved for the
    occasions where you know pleather bondage gear and six-inch platform
    boots will be appreciated.
