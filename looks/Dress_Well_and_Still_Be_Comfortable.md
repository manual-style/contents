Dressing well and remaining comfortable at the same time requires a
combination of balancing comfort features with elegance. It can be a
challenge but it is achievable with attention to the small details.

## Steps

1.  Go through your closet. Take everything out and try everything on.
    Look at yourself in a mirror- does the garment look good? Or is it
    worn out, unflattering, or a bad fit? Separate out clothes that look
    good from those that don't.

2.  Check for comfort. Try on the clothes that look good on you and
    really think about how it feels. Is it too tight? Can you move
    around in it? Does it expose more than you'd like? If you have to,
    wear the garment for a while and take note of any aspect of it that
    is uncomfortable. Put the uncomfortable clothes with the ones that
    look bad.

3.  Assess what you have left. It's probably not much. When you try
    things on at the store, you might feel like a shirt is too tight,
    but since you take it off after a few seconds, you don't think about
    it. Also, mainstream clothes come in just a few sizes, and often
    they're just thrown together with as little expense as possible.
    -   Quality and high-end brands differ in that they know their
        customers have money for other options. They'd better make a
        good dress, because if they don't, they'll lose revenue.
4.  Buy smarter in the future. Don't freak out if you can't afford
    anything pricier than Target or Kohl's. It's possible to look great
    on a budget. When you shop, do it in-store so you can feel fabric
    and inspect fine details. Take your time when deciding what to buy.
    Really be aware of how you feel in the garment. Don't rush to buy
    what looks good but feels subpar. You'll wear it once and never
    again because you won't be able to stand how it feels.

5.  Shop for basics. Basics are pieces that go with nearly everything.
    For instance, a plain, white blouse that can dress up or down, a few
    pairs of jeans (in different washes), black or white plain skirts
    and pants, and other things in solid colors, often in black or
    white.

    -   Take your time getting basics to find the most comfortable ones
        possible.
    -   If you have enough money to buy a few higher-quality pieces,
        it's best if you go for the basics. They can be included in so
        many outfits; it will be money well spent.

## Tips

-   Be sure you don't go over board comfortable and cute doesn't mean
    dressing in your little sisters clothes.
-   Enjoy shopping. Stop when your feet start killing you.
-   Try to maintain and keep to your shopping budget. Unnecessary debt
    isn't attractive.
-   Watch for sales.
