Bras provide support and padding that can make clothing look more
flattering. However, bras can also be uncomfortable and even get in the
way of wearing some kinds of clothing. If you are considering a braless
look, then it is important to consider what to wear. You may also
benefit from using some tricks to hide your nipples and keep your
breasts covered. If you are still on the fence about going braless, then
there are some things that might help you decide if it is right for you.

## Steps

### Choosing What to Wear

1.  Pick something that makes you feel good. The most important thing to
    consider when choosing how to dress without a bra is how an outfit
    will make you feel. Don't wear anything that makes you feel
    uncomfortable or self-conscious. Choose something that flatters your
    body, suits your style, and makes you feel great when you put it
    on.![](Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_1_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_1_Version_4.jpg")
    -   For example, if low-cut tops make you feel self-conscious, then
        they're not the best choice for you. Try a low-back top or
        spaghetti strap dress instead.
2.  Try a classic no-bra top or dress. There are some types of tops and
    dresses that don't look as good with a bra, so wearing these when
    you go braless might be a good idea. Try wearing low back and
    backless tops, or go for a strapless or spaghetti strap dress or
    top. Some other items that might look better without a bra
    include:![](Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_2_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_2_Version_4.jpg")
    -   Dresses and tops with plunging necklines.
    -   Tops with laced-up fronts, backs, or sides.
    -   Tops and dresses with keyholes in the back.
    -   Halter tops and tube tops.
3.  Look for items with built-in bras and support. Some items of
    clothing have built-in bras, breast cups, or elastic bands that
    eliminate the need for a bra. Try looking for clothes that have some
    built-in support to make going braless a little
    easier.![](Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_3_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_3_Version_4.jpg")
    -   A tank top with a built-in bra can help you transition into
        bralessness. You can still to wear them afterwards under sheer
        tops.[1]
    -   Bodysuits and leotards provide built-in support and make cute
        additions to braless outfits. Try one under a thin, button-down
        top for a breezy look.
4.  Consider starting with a layered braless look. Layers are great
    without a bra because they can hide your bralessness. This wardrobe
    technique is especially useful in the wintertime. For this reason,
    winter might even be the best time to try going braless, if you're
    nervous about the
    transition.[2]![](Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_4_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_4_Version_4.jpg")
    -   A thick sweater will hide your nipples, so this might be a good
        braless clothing choice if you are worried about your nipples
        showing.
    -   A T-shirt over or under a long-sleeve shirt is also a great
        braless combo.
    -   Jackets and cardigans are another great layering option, and can
        keep your warm when the weather takes an unexpected turn.[3]

### Hiding Your Nipples When You Go Braless

1.  Wear nipple covers or tape to hide your nipples. One way to prevent
    your nipples from being visible through your clothing is to cover
    them up with nipple tape or pasties.[4] [5] You can find these in
    the lingerie section of most department stores or in lingerie
    specialty
    stores.![](Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_5_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_5_Version_4.jpg")
    -   To use pasties, remove the adhesive from the pasty and apply it
        over your nipple.
    -   To use nipple tape, apply a couple of strips over your nipples
        in the form of an X.
    -   Try silicone nipple covers. They're reusable and stick to your
        body without adhesive. They work with most fabrics and styles of
        clothing.
2.  Wear thick fabric tops. Avoid clothing that is made with thin or
    sheer fabric. Thin fabric could expose your nipples, especially if
    the fabric is a light color. If you want to wear a top or dress like
    this without a bra, try wearing it over an undershirt or
    slip.[6]![](Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_6_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_6_Version_4.jpg")
    -   Silk or satin tops might not be a good choice when you go
        braless because the material is thin and it may be too
        revealing.
3.  Choose dark colors. Dark colors are less likely to become see
    through in bright light or if your shirt becomes wet. If you will be
    outside on a sunny day or there's a chance of rain, wear tops that
    are made with dark fabric. Otherwise, your nipples may be visible
    through the
    fabric.[7]![](Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_7_Version_4.jpg "fig:Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_7_Version_4.jpg")
    -   Fabric with patterns, especially small patterns, may also help
        to conceal your nipples.
4.  Use toupee tape to keep your neckline in place. You may feel more
    confident if you tape the neckline of a low cut top or dress to your
    chest. This will help to prevent the fabric from slipping and
    showing your nipples. Toupee tape is ideal for keeping your neckline
    in
    place.[8]![](Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Place the tape along the edges of your neckline and then press
        the other side of the tape against your skin to hold it in
        place.
    -   Tape can't make up for clothing that just doesn't fit right. If
        you're going to go without a bra, it's essential that your
        clothes fit properly.[9]
5.  Use surgical tape to keep your breasts in place. Surgical tape is a
    heavy-duty tape made to stick to skin, and you can find it in drug
    stores. Keep in mind that taping is uncomfortable, so it's best
    reserved for special occasions. To properly apply surgical
    tape:[10]![](Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Lean over to lift your breasts.
    -   Apply a strip of tape from the outside of one breast to the
        outside of the other. Keep the tape on the underside of your
        breasts.
    -   Stand up and apply another strip of tape across your breasts,
        pulling them together and covering your nipples. The ends of the
        second tape should touch the ends of the first strip.

### Considering Going Braless

1.  Consider your clothes. You may want to consider going braless in
    tops or dresses which your bra would peek out of if you wore one.
    Deep plunging necklines, large keyholes in the back, and backless
    tops or dresses are all items of clothing that look better when worn
    without a
    bra.![](Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Tops or dresses with spaghetti straps or no straps can usually
        be worn with a strapless bra.
    -   Not all fabrics are suitable for bralessness. Thin or lacy
        fabrics will leave your nipples exposed, and some fabrics, like
        wool or stiff cotton, may irritate your skin.
    -   Synthetic fabrics, like Lycra or nylon, work well without a bra
        because they're smooth, comfortable, and offer support.
2.  Examine the situation. There are some situations where you might be
    expected to wear a bra. Job interviews, court appearances, or
    meeting your partner's parents for the first time might not be the
    best times to go braless. If you decide not to wear a bra, think
    about the situation first and decide if you will feel comfortable
    going
    braless.[11]![](Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Remember: you can dress however you like. If going braless makes
        *you* feel more comfortable, then do it! Don't let anyone make
        you feel bad about yourselfâ€”ever.[12]
3.  Don't worry about sagging. There is no evidence that going without a
    bra makes your breasts sag earlier, and no evidence that wearing a
    bra keeps them from sagging. Several recent studies have even found
    that going braless regularly may actually help your breasts to
    become
    perkier.[13]![](Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
    -   You should still wear a sports bra when you exercise, however.
        It will help keep your breasts in place, which is important when
        you're moving a lot.
4.  Ease into bralessness. If you want to start going without a bra more
    often, you may experience some discomfort since your breasts aren't
    used to being free to move. To ease into bralessness, try one of the
    following:[14]![](Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_With_No_Bra_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Trade in your padded underwire for one without pads or
        underwires.
    -   Go braless at night and around the house until you feel
        comfortable without your bra on.
