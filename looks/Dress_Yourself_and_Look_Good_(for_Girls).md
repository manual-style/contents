Looking great every day is easier than you think! Start by filling your
wardrobe with clothes that fit well and work with your body shape. It’s
also important to build your outfits systematically so that your
ensemble looks polished. Choose a base item first, like a top or
bottoms. Then, select other pieces that specifically complement the
color, cut, and style of your base item. Don’t forget to complete your
look with a great pair of shoes and matching accessories!

## Steps

### Choosing Flattering Clothes

1.  [Determine your body shape](Determine-Your-Body-Shape "wikilink") to
    help you choose flattering pieces. While everybody is different,
    most female bodies fall into 1 of the following body shape
    categories: pear, apple, straight, inverted triangle, or hourglass.
    Start by measuring around the fullest part of your chest, the
    smallest part of your waist, and the widest part of your hips. Then,
    rank your bust, hip, and waist measurements from largest to
    smallest.[1]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_1.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_1.jpeg")
    -   If your bust and waist are smaller than your hips, you are a
        pear shape.
    -   If your bust is larger than your waist and hips, you’re an
        inverted triangle.
    -   If your bust, waist, and hips are about the same, you have a
        rectangle shape.
    -   If your waist is wider than your bust and hips, you're an apple
        shape.
    -   If your waist is smaller than your bust and hips, you have an
        hourglass shape.
2.  Emphasize your bust if you have an apple body shape. If you have an
    [apple body shape](Dress-an-Apple-Shape-Body "wikilink"), wear tops
    that highlight your bust and show off your shoulders. Try to avoid
    clingy materials around the waist area, and gravitate toward thin
    belts rather than thick ones. Solid colors tend to look better than
    busy patterns on apple bodies, but feel free to
    experiment![2]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_2.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_2.jpeg")
    -   You can also choose to emphasize shapely legs with tights and
        skirts.
    -   Keep in mind that these aren't hard and fast rules—there is
        plenty of room for experimentation.
3.  Wear formfitting clothes that accentuate your waist if you're a
    rectangle shape. For [rectangle body
    shapes](Dress-a-Rectangle-Body-Shape "wikilink"), try form-fitting
    tops and scooped necklines to give your body more curves. Skinny
    jeans and dresses that emphasize your waist are also great
    options.[3]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_3.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_3.jpeg")
    -   Stay away from shapeless dresses, shoulder pads, and boxy tops
        and coats.
    -   Cinch loose clothes at the waist with your favorite belt so that
        your shape doesn't get lost in the fabric.
4.  Choose pieces that hug your curves if you have an hourglass shape.
    If you’re an
    [hourglass](Dress-if-You've-Got-an-Hourglass-Figure "wikilink"), go
    with tops, pants, and dresses that hug your curves and emphasize
    your waist. Avoid shapeless and baggy
    clothing.[4]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_4.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_4.jpeg")
    -   Stay away from pieces with extra fabric at the hips or bust to
        keep your look proportionate. Avoid wearing ruffles or pleats
        around your waist or hips.
    -   Be sure to wear supportive undergarments that fit you well!
5.  Go with clothes that accentuate your upper body if you have a pear
    shape. For
    [pears](Dress-if-You've-Got-a-Pear-Shaped-Figure "wikilink"), try
    wearing tops in bright colors and prints to draw attention to your
    upper body. Stick to dark pants and skirts to slim your hips and
    waistline.[5]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_5.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_5.jpeg")
    -   Avoid details, like beads or other embellishments, at the hip or
        rear, since these can draw attention to those areas.
    -   Go with wide necklines, like boat-necks, scoop-necks, and
        sweetheart necks, to broaden your shoulders and emphasize your
        bust.
6.  Accentuate your waist and legs if you have an inverted triangle body
    shape. If you’re an [inverted triangle body
    shape](Dress-the-Inverted-Triangle-Body-Shape "wikilink"), opt for
    tops with vertical stripes, A-line dresses, and bottoms that
    accentuate your waist and legs. Select wide-legged pants and skirts
    with bold, horizontal patterns to create the illusion of
    volume.[6]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_6.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_6.jpeg")
    -   Avoid pieces that make your hips look slimmer, like pencil
        skirts, skinny jeans, and other tapered cuts.
    -   Stay away from boxy shoulder pads and other shoulder
        embellishments that draw attention to this area.
7.  Opt for clothes that are comfortable and fit you well. Avoid buying
    clothes just because they’re on sale! Always try them on first and
    make sure they fit you well. If the item is too long, loose, short,
    small, or big for you, leave it on the rack. Also, go through your
    current wardrobe and get rid of anything that doesn’t fit you
    well.[7]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_7.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_7.jpeg")
    -   If you own clothes that are too small, donate them to charity or
        give them to a little sister or cousin. Try to avoid keeping
        something that “might fit you again one day” if it’s already too
        small.
    -   Toss out baggy clothing unless you think it can be tailored to
        fit you perfectly. It’s usually only worth spending money on
        tailoring an item if it’s something really nice, though.
    -   Keep in mind that some clothes are supposed to be loose or
        formfitting! However, if your clothes are dragging on the
        ground, or if you feel like your movements are restricted, the
        items don't fit well.
8.  Wear colors that look great with your [skin’s natural
    undertones](Determine-Skin-Tone "wikilink"). No matter what your
    skin tone is, your skin’s undertones will fall into 1 of 3
    categories: cool, warm, or neutral. Once you determine your
    undertones, [choose clothes in colors that complement your
    undertones](Choose-Your-Best-Clothing-Colors "wikilink") for a
    simple way to look polished and
    put-together.![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_8.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_8.jpeg")
    -   People with warm undertones look great in reds, oranges,
        yellows, ivory, browns, and gold.
    -   Cool tones match well with greens, blues, pinks, purples, and
        silver.
    -   If you have neutral undertones, you can pull off almost any
        color! Go with medium shades of any color you want and avoid
        pastels.[8]

### Building Stylish Outfits

1.  Buy staple pieces that you can mix-and-match for an effortless look.
    Wardrobe staples are items that never go out of style, which means
    you can rock them at any time and feel confident that you look
    stylish. It’s really easy to build an outfit around staple pieces,
    especially if they’re solid colors that you can mix-and-match with
    other items in your
    closet.[9]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_9.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_9.jpeg")
    -   Classic staple pieces are basic white T-shirts, black leggings,
        neutral-colored cardigans, long-sleeved button-down shirts, blue
        jeans, and black leather jackets.
    -   Don't cater too much to the trends—these usually last just a
        season. Wear trendy pieces as accents and mix these up with your
        basic pieces.
2.  Select a base item to build the rest of your outfit around. Once you
    determine a base item, you can easily build complementary pieces
    around it to complete your outfit. This could be a top, bottom, or
    even a cool pair of shoes. Picking the rest of your ensemble will be
    a snap once you have the initial element laid
    down![10]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_10.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_10.jpeg")
    -   For example, you might decide you want to wear black skinny
        jeans, a colorful halter top, or a patterned sweater.
3.  Opt for pieces in contrasting solid colors to create visual
    interest. Contrasting colors break up your outfit and keep it from
    looking uniform. When choosing contrasting colors, try to stay
    within the same shade range. If you start with a neutral, pair it
    with a contrasting
    neutral.[11]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_11.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_11.jpeg")
    -   For example, pair a jewel-toned color with another jewel-toned
        color. If your base piece is pastel, choose a contrasting pastel
        piece to go with it.
    -   Pairing a white top with black jeans is a simple way to make
        your neutral outfit pop. Neutrals work in any season.
    -   Wear a pastel pink skirt with a pastel blue polo shirt for a
        cute spring look.
    -   A burgundy long-sleeved shirt under a sleeveless forest-green
        corduroy dress would be great for fall.
4.  Pair print or patterned base items with solid-colored pieces. Avoid
    wearing multiple patterns or prints simultaneously. If your base
    item is a cute plaid skirt, make sure your other elements are solid.
    Choose solid colors pulled from the pattern of your base item to
    pull your look
    together.[12]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_12.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_12.jpeg")
    -   For example, if your plaid skirt is mostly navy blue with forest
        green and tan as secondary colors, choose a top that matches 1
        of the secondary colors to tie the look together.
5.  Try a half-tuck so that your shape isn’t swallowed up by a baggy
    top. You can always tuck in your shirt completely, but if you’re
    styling a casual outfit with a loose top, experiment with tucking
    half of the front of the top into your pants. That way, your waist
    isn’t lost in baggy layers and your outfit looks a little more
    polished.![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_13.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_13.jpeg")
    -   For example, half-tuck a loose sweater into regular fit blue
        jeans for a cozy, stylish look that doesn’t swallow you whole.
6.  Choose a third layer in a complementary or contrasting color and
    texture. Layers can quickly elevate any outfit and create a more
    stylish vibe. Cardigans, hoodies, tights, vests, and jackets are
    typically considered to be third layers. Select colors that tie into
    or contrast with your outfit. Opt for fabrics with a different
    texture than your base
    items.[13]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_14.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_14.jpeg")
    -   For example, pair a pumpkin-colored cable knit cardigan with a
        burgundy silk top and dark wash skinny jeans.
    -   Elevate a basic white T-shirt and blue jeans with a black
        leather moto jacket.
    -   Top off your outfit with a well-cut blazer or fuzzy cardigan in
        a contrasting color.
7.  Go with cuts and styles that flatter each other when building
    layers. Create a streamlined look by selecting layers that make
    sense with the cut and style of your base pieces. It can be fun to
    pair contrasting styles, but wearing layers in similar styles always
    looks put-together and
    effortless!![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_15.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_15.jpeg")
    -   For example, avoid wearing bulky or baggy layers on top of
        fitted pieces. If you're wearing skinny jeans and a fitted
        shirt, top it off with a slim-cut cardigan or perfectly tailored
        blazer for a polished ensemble.
    -   If you're wearing an edgy graphic T-shirt with your favorite
        band's name emblazoned on the front, pull on a leather jacket
        and biker boots to complete your street-ready look.

### Accessorizing and Completing Your Look

1.  Wear shoe colors that complement the colors of your outfit. Black
    and nude shoes go with almost any outfit, so when in doubt, reach
    for one of those colors! If your outfit has a lot of brown in it,
    avoid black shoes and opt for brown or nude shoes instead. If you’re
    wearing a bright pattern, wear solid-colored shoes. If your shoes
    are bold, like a leopard print, pair them with solid-colored tops
    and
    bottoms.[14]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_16.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_16.jpeg")
    -   Add another visual element to your outfit by choosing shoes with
        an interesting texture, like suede.
2.  Match your shoes, belt, and bag for a polished look. If you’re
    wearing black shoes, pair them with a black belt and black bag to
    instantly pull your entire outfit together. Do the same with nude
    and brown accessories. Make sure the hardware matches, as
    well![15]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_17.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_17.jpeg")
    -   For example, if your belt has a silver buckle, your bag and
        shoes should also have silver elements.
    -   Your jewelry, like bangles, necklaces, and earrings, should also
        match. If your belt has a gold buckle, wear gold earrings.
3.  Grab a pair of statement sunglasses to complete any outfit. Fun
    sunglasses can take almost any outfit to the next level! Choose
    sunglasses that flatter [your face
    shape](Figure-out-Your-Face-Shape "wikilink") and match or contrast
    with the colors of your outfit for the best
    results.[16]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_18.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_18.jpeg")
    -   For example, try a pair of black cat-eye sunglasses for a
        classic look. Oversized shades or round lenses are great for
        bohemian styles.
4.  Stack your rings for a cool, street-style vibe. If you’re into boho
    or easy glam looks, try layering your rings! Put your biggest ring
    on your index finger of either hand. Then, layer regular and midi
    rings on your ring fingers. Finish off the look with 2-3 contrasting
    midi rings on your middle
    fingers.![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_19.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_19.jpeg")
5.  [Apply natural makeup](Apply-Natural-Makeup-for-School "wikilink")
    for a fresh-faced look if you like makeup. Makeup isn't a
    requirement, but it can help you feel more confident and
    put-together if you enjoy wearing it. [Apply a lightweight
    foundation](Apply-Foundation "wikilink") that matches your skin tone
    and use a dab of [concealer](Apply-Concealer "wikilink") to hide any
    imperfections and breakouts. Sweep on a subtle, rosy
    [blush](Apply-Blush "wikilink") and a hint of
    [mascara](Apply-Mascara "wikilink") for a fresh, natural makeup
    look.![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_20.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_20.jpeg")
    -   If you have oily skin, use a little powder to get rid of shine.
    -   Go with a nude or berry lip gloss or stain.
6.  Create a neat and simple hairstyle before you head out the door. Run
    a brush through straight hair to remove tangles. If you have curly
    hair, use your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to get rid of any
    knots. Then, wear your hair loose around your shoulders, pull it up
    to get it out of your face, or apply a texturizing product to
    shorter styles to provide shape and
    definition.![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_21.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_21.jpeg")
    -   Try applying a small amount of anti-frizz cream or serum to tame
        flyaways.
    -   If you have limited time in the morning, consider getting a
        low-maintenance haircut that's super easy to style.

### Practicing Self-Care

1.  [Wash your face](Wash-Your-Face "wikilink") twice a day to keep your
    skin clear. Wet your face with lukewarm water and gently massage a
    dime-size amount of face wash into your skin with your fingertips.
    Avoid scrubbing your face roughly! Then, rinse away the cleanser
    with warm water. Repeat this process every morning and each night
    before bed. You should also wash your face after sweating
    heavily.[17]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_22.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_22.jpeg")
    -   If you have dry or sensitive skin, you may want to limit
        cleanser to once per day, preferably in the evening. You can
        splash your face with plain warm water in the morning to rinse
        off your skin.
    -   Avoid harsh cleansers that list alcohol as an ingredient to
        prevent dry skin.
2.  [Apply moisturizer](Moisturize-Your-Face "wikilink") after washing
    your face to keep skin hydrated. After washing your face, gently pat
    your skin dry with a clean towel. Then, use your fingertips to apply
    a pea-sized amount of moisturizer all over your face. Be gentle
    around the delicate eye area when you're rubbing the product into
    your
    skin.[18]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_23.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_23.jpeg")
    -   Use a moisturizer with SPF 20 or higher in the morning to
        prevent sun damage.
    -   You can use a thicker moisturizer without SPF in the evening for
        an extra dose of hydration.
    -   Be sure to choose a moisturizer that’s formulated for your skin
        type.
3.  [Brush your teeth](Brush-Your-Teeth "wikilink") at least twice a day
    and [floss](Floss "wikilink") at night before bed. Dental hygiene is
    important for looking and feeling great every day! At a minimum,
    brush your teeth every morning before you leave the house and every
    evening before bed. Follow up with floss in the evening to remove
    food between your teeth. Rinse out your mouth with a quality
    mouthwash to kill germs and bacteria that cause bad
    breath.[19]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_24.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_24.jpeg")
    -   Ideally, you should brush your teeth after each meal.
    -   If you want to brighten your smile, try a whitening toothpaste.
    -   Visit your dentist at least once a year to get a cleaning and
        check for cavities.
4.  Shower at least once per day to keep your body clean. Most people
    should shower at least once a day; you can do this in the morning or
    at night before bed, depending on your personal preference. You
    should also shower after sweating
    heavily.[20]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_25.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_25.jpeg")
    -   Be sure to shampoo your hair at least once per week, depending
        on your hair type and texture. You can use dry shampoo on
        in-between days to prevent oily hair.
5.  Sleep 8-10 hours every night so that you're well-rested. Getting a
    good night’s sleep gives your body time to repair itself and helps
    you look and feel your best every day. Establish a sleep schedule so
    that you go to bed and wake up at about the same time every day. Try
    to stick to your schedule on the weekends,
    too![21]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_26.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_26.jpeg")
    -   While adults can get by with 7-9 hours of sleep per night,
        teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 need 8-10 hours.
6.  Eat a healthy diet that emphasizes nutritious food. A nutritious
    diet supports glowing skin and healthy hair and nails. Incorporate
    plenty of fresh fruits and veggies into your diet. Try to avoid
    processed grains, like white bread, and stick with whole grains. Eat
    plenty of low-fat protein, like seafood, lean meats, eggs, and
    legumes. When it comes to dairy, go with fat-free or low-fat
    options.[22]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_27.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_27.jpeg")
    -   Avoid skipping meals! Try to eat 3 meals per day or 5-6 small
        meals per day, depending on your preference, caloric needs, and
        schedule.
7.  Aim for at least 60 minutes of exercise per day to stay in shape.
    Exercising every day will keep you looking and feeling your best.
    For teen girls, 60 minutes of moderate exercise daily is ideal. You
    can choose any kind of exercise you want as long as it gets your
    heart
    pumping![23]![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_28.jpeg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_28.jpeg")
    -   For example, walking, jogging, playing sports, hitting the gym,
        biking, and dancing are just a few ways to get moving each day.
