A simple style is one that makes you feel confident and attractive
without much effort or stress. It can be accomplished by anyone willing
to make the right changes. Try simplifying your wardrobe, paring down
your makeup routine and opting for a classic, easy-to-pull-off
hairstyle.

## Steps

### Dressing Simply

1.  Build your wardrobe with classic staples. Having a few good staples
    goes a long way. You can mix and match them with each other and
    employ layers for all seasons. Choose classic items for an elegant
    appearance that doesn't require a lot of
    forethought.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For a dressed up event, any woman will tell you that their
        'little black dress' is a staple. To wear the dress for other
        occasions, interchange dressy pumps for simple black flats. For
        men, it's important to own a classic black suit and quality
        dress shoes.
    -   Some classic tops include a knit sweater or cardigan in a light
        color, a white shirt with a scooped neckline, and a white
        long-sleeve button down shirt.[1]
    -   Classic bottoms include black slacks or pants, along with
        dark-wash denim.[2]
2.  Buy quality over quantity. Quality material and well thought-out
    design will go much further in a simple wardrobe than discount or
    cheaply made clothing. You will be able to create multiple outfits
    from fewer items when the clothing fits you well and lasts a long
    time.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Be sure to take your time finding and purchasing the classic
        clothes you decide to invest in.
    -   If you want to dress up your look, a statement necklace,
        earrings, or other piece of jewelry will go a long way.
3.  Keep a pair of jeans in your wardrobe. Jeans are a staple you can
    always rely on for a simple look. Choose jeans that are are a solid,
    neutral color, and don't have a large amount of detail, rips, or
    other decorations and seam-work on them.They'll go with
    everything.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Dark wash jeans are the best option since they compliment just
        about any top and look slimming.
    -   For the same reasons, black denim, yoga, or cotton pants are
        also a great staple for your wardrobe.[3] Dark pants go well
        with a wide variety of other colors, and can be dressed up or
        down, so the options for tops and shoes are endless.
4.  Pair dark pants with a light top. To keep the simple look, choose a
    white or gray top. Avoid bold patterned shirts and bright
    colors.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you have a lighter pair of jeans or pants, a black top can
        also look nice.
    -   Choose tops in any type of material, from cotton jersey to silk
        or satin.
5.  Wear practical shoes. If you need to dress up an outfit you'll want
    classic solid color dress shoes for men, or black pumps or flats for
    ladies. Depending on the weather, you may want to wear classic
    sneakers (such as solid color tennis shoes), flats, or sandals. Wear
    shoes that feel comfortable, aren't flashy or trendy (less is more),
    and match the rest of your
    outfit.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_5.jpg")
    -   Be smart about your style. For instance, if you live in an area
        that gets a lot of rain you will likely need to pair your outfit
        with rain boots.
    -   For simplicity's sake, you may plan to have one pair of simple
        walking shoes for each season: sandals for summer, flats for
        fall, ankle boots for winter, and so on.
6.  Employ one accent piece to show your uniqueness. Because your outfit
    is pleasantly simple, it allows for something else like tattoos, big
    hair, or a statement necklace to really take the stage. If you have
    something uniquely you, play that up as your main
    attraction.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_6.jpg")
    -   Wear clothes that leave tattoos exposed to show them off.
    -   You can focus on an item, such as a bright colored scarf, by
        wearing it with a contrasting white top.

### Creating a Fresh-Faced Appearance

1.  Wash and moisturize your face. To start fresh and with a clean slate
    you'll want to rinse your face with cold water. If you have dry
    skin, apply a moisturizer. For some, this is the only step you'll
    need if you choose not to apply
    makeup.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_7.jpg")
    -   A great oil facial oil that suites almost any skin-type is
        jojoba oil, because it neutralizes and accommodates to oily or
        dry skin.[4]
    -   Coconut oil as a face moisturizer works well used the night
        before you're going for a simple look. It is oily to leave on
        during the day but soaks into your skin overnight.[5]
2.  Use toner if you're choosing to apply makeup. Toner will cleanse
    your pores more deeply than just washing your face with water.[6] It
    will also make pores shrink, which will give your skin a smoother
    look. Put a few drops on a cotton ball and dab it all over your
    face, being careful around your
    eyes.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_8.jpg")
    -   Toner is a good option for men, too. It smells fresh and can
        help you avoid pimples or bumps from shaving. Just be sure not
        to use toner directly after you shave, as it may contain alcohol
        and burn.
3.  Tweeze your eyebrows. Shape your brows to look cleaned up and
    attractive, even if you do nothing else. You can also use an eyebrow
    pencil to help fill in sparse areas and give definition. To figure
    out how to shape your
    brows,![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Look in the mirror and visualize a line from the corner of your
        nose straight up until it reaches your eyebrow; that should be
        the place where your brow begins.
    -   Identify the peak of your arch by drawing an imaginary angled
        line from the corner of your nose through your pupil.
    -   Identify the spot where your brow should stop by making another
        line from the corner of your nose angled to the outer corner of
        your eye.[7]
    -   Pluck the hairs that fall outside the areas you identified.
4.  Consider using foundation and concealer. To further smooth out your
    skin tone while keeping things simple, you might want to use
    foundation and concealer. It's a good way to cover blemishes without
    going over the
    top.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Use your fingers or a makeup brush to apply foundation evenly on
        your face.[8] It is helpful to dab dots around your face and
        then blend it in so there aren't uneven areas.
    -   Use concealer to cover dark spots, acne, and especially under
        your eyes to hide dark circles.
    -   You can brush powder over your face after using concealer to
        further give the appearance of smooth skin and 'set' your
        makeup.[9]
    -   If you want to take it one step further, apply a light blush.
        Smile and use a brush to sweep blush onto the raised area of
        your cheeks. The strokes should go from the center and out.
5.  Choose neutral eye makeup. Look for pallets that have browns, pinks
    or a bronze hue depending on what may match your skin tone. Use a
    makeup brush to blend a light shadow from your eyebrows down to your
    eye lid
    crease.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_11.jpg")
    -   For more definition, use black eyeliner on upper and/or lower
        lids. Crimp your lashes and apply mascara.
    -   For a basic winged look, apply a line of eyeliner to the top of
        your eye with a light and short curve up at the outer corners of
        your eyes.[10]
    -   Another simple option for eyeliner is a line following the
        bottom inner corner of your eye to the outer corner. Again, this
        should not be thick or stand out, but just enough to add
        attention to your eyes.
    -   Use pencil eyeliners rather than liquid eyeliners for a more
        natural and blended look.

### Styling Simple Hair

1.  Pick a part. For both men and women, part your hair in a different
    way to give yourself an easy, new style. There is the middle part, a
    side part, and even the zig-zag part to try, where sections of hair
    slightly cross over each other toward the front of the
    head.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_12.jpg")
    -   If you have a square face, the side part is most attractive,
        while the center part is better left for those with round
        faces.[11]
2.  Go with a teased look. If you want to give the look of more volume,
    gather sections of your hair and use a comb to lightly brush about
    an inch away from your scalp back toward your roots. This can be
    helpful if you want a messy bun or ponytail look without your hair
    hugging tight to your
    head.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Men, this will work for you as well. If you have long enough
        hair you can try teasing sections to give yourself texture.
        Avoid doing this all over, especially not close to the face on
        the sides of the head and over the ears. Instead, try limiting
        it to the section above your temples and further back.
3.  Tell your barber to cut your hair shorter on the sides. Men can pull
    off looking classic by cutting the hair on the sides of their head
    and keeping the top section longer. This is called a fade haircut.
    You can use gel and brush the section back, or finger comb gel in if
    you choose to style it in the
    morning.[12]![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_14.jpg")
    -   Overall this hairstyle is easy to maintain and there are many
        variations in length and tapering which you and/or your barber
        can try out.
4.  Work a classic crew cut. It doesn't actually get much simpler than
    this unless you get a buzzcut. There is little maintenance here and
    it keeps your hair from taking over your style. Good grooming and
    clean cut lines will take this look to the next
    level.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_15.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_15.jpg")
5.  Put your hair in a ponytail. If your hair is long enough, one of the
    most basic and simple hair styles is a ponytail. Tie your hair up
    around the higher 3rd of the back of your head. If you have a bob
    that fits into a smaller ponytail, that works as
    well.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_16.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_16.jpg")
6.  Throw it up into a messy bun. Another simple hairstyle is the bun.
    Twist your ponytail around and secure a knot with another hair tie,
    or use bobby pins if your hair slips
    out.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_17.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_17.jpg")
    -   For a stylish hairdo, men can pull their hair back into a
        man-bun and add an under-shave cut to take it a step further.
    -   Pull a couple pieces of hair loose from above your temples for a
        more relaxed look.
7.  Pull back half of your hair. Gather hair from above your ears back
    toward the mid-top area of your scalp and secure with a hair tie or
    clip. You can also gather smaller sections away from your face and
    secure back. Use a head band to create another style that keeps hair
    out of your face without pulling it all
    back.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_18.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_18.jpg")
8.  Braid your hair. A simple, single braid down the back can be a great
    way to pull off a simple yet attractive design. A french braid is
    even more attractive and can be made into two for a whole different
    look. You could also form two small braids from sections off the
    sides of your temples and tie them back for a nice
    style.![](Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_19.jpg "fig:Dress_and_Look_Simple_Step_19.jpg")
    -   Fishtail braids are also beautiful and easy to learn by watching
        a YouTube video or two, or asking a friend who knows how.

## Tips

-   Be yourself. The simple look takes the emphasis off of your
    appearance and onto your personality.
-   For the real simple look, don't paint your nails bright colors. A
    simple French manicure on short nails looks fine.
-   Pixie cuts are fantastic in their simplicity and there's no need to
    worry about styling unless you have a preference.
-   Avoid wearing flashy jewelry when going casual.
-   Keep purses small and a solid color.
-   These styles are variable depending on where you live and what style
    is popular. For example, if most people your age wear a certain
    style of shoe in your area then that is the shoe to wear for your
    simple look. Just keep the colors to white, brown, black, or easy on
    the eye.

## Warnings

-   If you are usually a bold stylist and character, you may want to
    ease into the simple look by changing aspects of your look one day
    at a time rather than overnight to avoid shocking family and friends
    and to adjust to taking on the new look.
