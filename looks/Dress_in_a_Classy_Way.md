Sometimes you just want to add a little class to your everyday wardrobe.
It's easy and it looks mighty spiffy.

## Steps

1.  Go to a store like Brooks Brothers, Jos. A. Bank, or even Macy's.
    Pick up some shirts (French cuffs are a real charmer) and tiesâ€”a
    good mix of bow ties and neck
    ties.![](Dress_in_a_Classy_Way_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_in_a_Classy_Way_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Get some slacks or casual pants. Make sure that at least one shirt
    goes with each pair of
    pants.![](Dress_in_a_Classy_Way_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_in_a_Classy_Way_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Some boat shoes are good as casual shoes, like Sperry Top-Seders. If
    you really want to dress to impress, you'll get some cap-toe or
    wingtip dress shoes,
    though.![](Dress_in_a_Classy_Way_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_in_a_Classy_Way_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Argyle socks are always fun. Pick up a whole lot of these, so you
    can color coordinate your outfits with
    these.![](Dress_in_a_Classy_Way_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_in_a_Classy_Way_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")

## Tips

-   Make sure that your tie knots are nice and tight; the classic half
    Windsor knot is best.
-   For bow ties, make sure you keep the sides even.
-   Shine and polish your dress shoes regularly.
-   Have your shirts dry-cleaned and starched so they're always crisp
    and elegant.
-   Dress trousers should be dry-cleaned, but casual pants such as
    chinos can be washed at home if you know how to iron a decent crease
    in them.
