## Tips

-   Short skirts are worn A LOT, but normally paired with colourful or
    pastel tights or socks since the style is child like and not
    sexually inspired.
-   People will look at you funny, but that's okay, because you love the
    way you're dressing and that's all that matters
-   When you see someone else dressing this way you will be over come
    with happiness and i really hope you share a moment of exciting
    facial expressions with this other person.
