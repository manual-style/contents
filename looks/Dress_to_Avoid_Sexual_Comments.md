Have you ever worn an outfit that everyone kept making offensive sexual
comments about? Maybe it was that skirt that showed too much or those
shorts that looked way too short.

## Steps

1.  Collect all clothing that seems like it won't attract unwanted
    attention.![](Dress_to_Avoid_Sexual_Comments_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_to_Avoid_Sexual_Comments_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Collect clothing similar to those that attract unwanted attention.
    If your short skirts are garnering comments, you should probably
    collect your short shorts as well. Think through what the issues are
    with each item. Can any of them be salvaged by wearing them
    differently? For example, short skirts or shorts may be less
    revealing if worn over tights. Snug T shirts could be worn under a
    short blouse,
    etc.![](Dress_to_Avoid_Sexual_Comments_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_to_Avoid_Sexual_Comments_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Consider the crowd. If those around you are from cultures that have
    prejudise based on appearance, understand why they have such notions
    and if you like, research about what is considered modest in their
    culture.
4.  Avoid navel showing tops.
5.  Avoid see through fabrics if you are stared at often.
6.  Wear thicker fabrics. Try denim and other thick and good quality
    fabrics.
7.  Purchase alternative clothing such as Capri's instead of short
    shorts. Capri's are comfortable, yet cool, and they don't expose as
    much
    skin.![](Dress_to_Avoid_Sexual_Comments_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_to_Avoid_Sexual_Comments_Step_3.jpg")
8.  Avoid revealing shirts. Cap sleeves, strapless, backless tops etc
    attracts unwelcome
    attention.![](Dress_to_Avoid_Sexual_Comments_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_to_Avoid_Sexual_Comments_Step_4.jpg")
9.  Beware of V-necks that swoop way too low. Consider layering them
    with something that has a higher
    neckline.![](Dress_to_Avoid_Sexual_Comments_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_to_Avoid_Sexual_Comments_Step_5.jpg")
    -   Try a jacket over deep neck tops.
    -   Wrap a shawl to complete the look and cover up.
10. Avoid leggings unless there is another item covering the butt and
    panty
    lines.![](Dress_to_Avoid_Sexual_Comments_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_to_Avoid_Sexual_Comments_Step_6.jpg")
11. Wear mid waist or high waist pants. Low waist pants may slide down
    while sitting and show the undergarments.

12. Wear collared shirts. Opt for your favourite colours may it be
    pastels or solid colours so it doesn't pinch to dress for a specific
    cause.
    -   You can wear tops or tunics that are longer. You may avoid
        tucking them in if you like, letting them loose.
13. Make the most of the choices. Opt for flared skirts, straight fit
    pants, your choice of cuts etc.
14. Opt between shapes and sizes. Wear clothes that are atleast 2-3cms
    loose depending upon your comfort and needs.

## Tips

-   Wear according to the occasion and your role. If people stare
    unnecessarily, you may have to move past such instances without
    worrying about them.
