how to dress like a country girl.

## Steps

1.  Wear boots! Tassels seem in right now as well. If you don't like
    wearing boots then try pumps but don't wear trainers.
2.  Wear checks and scruffy jeans. You can instantly look like a country
    girl if you put on a baggy checked t-shirt and worn out jeans.
    Floral prints are also nice if you want to be more girly.
3.  If you don't like wearing jeans- try dresses. Look at images of
    Taylor Swift and how she dresses. Pair some brown boots with a flowy
    white dress and add a brown belt for the perfect look!
4.  Leave your hair down. Its best if you leave your hair looking
    natural. You could straighten it or put gentle waves in if you want.
    Wearing a headband all the way round your head practically screams
    country girl. If you don't want to leave your hair down you can
    always tie it in a ponytail or plait it as well.
5.  Add a belt to your outfit and some bangles to create the perfect
    rustic look. Don't overdo the jewelery though, and leave out really
    sparkly items.
6.  Don't add to much make up. Give your lips a rosy tint by adding a
    moisturising lip balm, add a little blush to your cheeks and apply a
    bit of mascara. The main thing is to keep your skin looking fresh
    and clear, use moisturiser and cleansers regularly.

## Tips

-   Always keep a pair of boots- they are a staple in any country girls
    wardrobe!
-   Check charity shops for good buys.

## Warnings

-   Don't change who you are- if you feel the way you are dressing isn't
    reflecting your personality try out different styles until you find
    the one that suits you!
