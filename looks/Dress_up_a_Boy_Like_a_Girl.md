Sometimes a boy wants or needs to dress like a girl. Whether it’s for an
acting role, just for fun, gaining a new perspective, or adopting a new
lifestyle, a boy can easily dress like a girl. With a little
preparation, the right outfit, and stylish makeup, any boy can look like
a girl.

## Steps

### Getting Him Ready

1.  Make sure he wants to do this. You should only dress him up if he
    thinks it's a good idea. He should be comfortable and relaxed about
    the idea.

    -   Don't take any photos or videos without his permission. If you
        do take them, never share them without permission. This counts
        as a betrayal of trust. Double-check with him before taking or
        sharing pictures or video.
    -   If he doesn't think it would be fun, then let it go. Maybe
        another boy would like to dress up.
    -   Double-check each step of the process with him. For example, if
        he's scared of the tweezers, tell him that he can skip having
        his eyebrows plucked.
2.  Shave his legs, armpits, and face. For a boy to dress like a girl,
    he needs to have no leg, facial, or armpit hair. Have him take a
    shower and shave his legs, armpits, and face. If he doesn’t want to
    do it himself, have him sit on a chair while you gently shave
    him.[1]![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Spread shaving cream onto his legs, dip a razor in a bucket of
        water, and then save the hair off of his legs. Dip the razor
        into the water after each pass of the razor on his legs to
        prevent cuts.
3.  Shape his eyebrows. Girls shape their eyebrows to achieve a natural
    arch without any stray hairs, so shaping the boy’s eyebrows will
    help him look feminine.[2]
    ![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Use tweezers to pluck stray eyebrow hairs or use face wax to wax
        the eyebrows into a natural arch.
4.  Put girl’s deodorant and perfume on. The scent of deodorant is
    different for boys and girls. Get a deodorant sold for girls and
    have the boy wear it. You should also have the boy wear a perfume
    meant for girls to get him smelling like a
    girl.![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")

### Dressing Up Like a Girl

1.  Find an outfit that fits well. Girls tend to wear clothes that are
    more form fitting so you need to pick out an outfit that fits the
    boy well. Choosing a dress or skirt for the boy to wear will make it
    easy to distinguish that he’s dressing like a
    girl.![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Some boys have very broad shoulders so finding a dress that fits
        him right might be hard. If the boy has broad shoulders,
        consider putting him in a skirt and shirt to get a better fit.
    -   If you choose to have him wear pants, it would be a good idea to
        have him wear skinny jeans with boots. This look is a popular
        style with girls.
2.  Pick complementary colors and styles. The shape of his clothing can
    impact how others view him when they look at his body. Get a more
    feminine shape by using clothes and their colors to accentuate areas
    of the body.[3]
    ![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Wearing dark colors around the waist provides a slimming effect
        to create an hourglass look.
    -   Pick v-neck or lower cut tops to provide a more girly style.
3.  Add accessories. You can add different types of accessories to the
    outfit to complete the look. Accessories are an important part of a
    girl’s outfit, so adding accessories will give an authentic look to
    the boy’s outfit.[4]
    ![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_6_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_6_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Jewelry like necklaces, bracelets, rings, and clip-on earrings
        will add a feminine touch to the outfit.
    -   If the boy is wearing a dress or skirt, you can have him wear
        tights to add color or design to his look.
4.  Select feminine shoes. Shoe style is important when trying to dress
    a boy like a girl. If you want to make a boy look like a girl, he
    needs to wear shoes that are
    feminine.![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_7_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_7_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Shoes with heels are a great choice. There are dress shoes and
        boots that have heels. Choosing a shorter heel is a good idea if
        the boy isn’t used to walking in heels yet.
    -   Fashion boots are also a great choice for dressing a boy like a
        girl.

### Styling His Hair

1.  Grow long hair. Boys who enjoy dressing like girls often grow long
    hair to accommodate lots of different hair styles.
    ![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_8_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_8_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Curl his hair to add more volume.
    -   Blow dry and style his hair after a shower.
    -   He can wear a low ponytail if he wants to dress like a boy.
2.  Cut his hair in a flowy style. Get a haircut that incorporates soft
    waves to soften and feminize the face.[5]
    ![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Haircuts with sharp angles may make his face look more angular
        and rigid.
    -   If you choose to dye his hair, pick a color that compliments his
        skin tone. Light colors are best for cool skin tones, darker
        colors compliment warm skin tones.
3.  Accessorize his hair. You can accessorize his natural hair with hair
    clips, bows, and headbands to add a feminine touch to the outfit.
    Brush his hair and sweep the front to the side with a girl’s hair
    clip to make his hair look like a girl’s pixie
    cut.![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Hair clips, headbands, and bows are a great accessory to add to
        the boy’s hair.
    -   Put ribbons or barrettes in his hair to look more feminine.
4.  Put on a wig. If you want him to have longer hair, he can wear a
    wig. Choose a wig that is close to his hair color to make it look
    more natural. Style the wig in any style you
    like.![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_11.jpg")
    -   Wigs are a good way to create a total transformation in his
        look.

### Applying Makeup

1.  Apply foundation and powder. Find a foundation color that matches
    his skin tone and apply it evenly to his face. Apply a matching
    powder over the foundation to finish the base of the makeup.[6]
    ![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_12.jpg")
2.  Put eye makeup on him. Eye makeup will help accent his eyes and make
    them look bigger. Eye makeup is a great way to make a boy look more
    feminine.[7]
    ![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Apply eyeshadow on his eyes to accentuate his eye color.
        Consider using two or three colors to blend onto his eyelid to
        make his eyes look bigger.
    -   Use eyeliner to draw a line at the base of the eyelid. This will
        accent the eyes and give a finished look to the eye makeup.
    -   Finish with mascara on his eyelashes. Use black mascara if he
        has dark eyelashes and brown mascara if he has light eyelashes.
        For a fun, festive look you can use colored mascara, like blue
        or purple, to make his eyelashes pop.
3.  Add blush to his cheeks. Blush is a great addition to dress a boy
    like a girl because it makes the face look more feminine. Apply the
    blush to the apples of his cheeks and his
    cheekbones.![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_14.jpg")
4.  Finish with lipstick. The finishing touch to makeup is adding color
    to the lips. You can line his lips with lip liner and then fill in
    the rest with lipstick.[8]
    ![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_15.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_15.jpg")
    -   Red, Pink, and Neutral colors are good choices to pick for his
        lipstick.

### Acting Like a Girl

1.  Encourage him to speak in a higher register. Even if he looks like a
    girl, a voice that sounds like a male’s will be easily recognized as
    a
    male.[9]![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_16.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_16.jpg")
    -   Tell him to practice speaking in a higher tone to make himself
        sound more feminine.
    -   Record him speaking so he can hear what he sounds like.
2.  Have him practice walking in a feminine manner. A feminine walk will
    help make the look of dressing like a woman appear more natural.[10]
    Women tend to walk more elegantly, and keep their knees and feet
    closer together than men do.
    ![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_17.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_17.jpg")
    -   His feet should pull him forward instead of storming ahead head
        first.
    -   Have him move his hips as he walks; let his hips lead his legs
        to engage his whole body as he walks.
3.  Help him adopt female mannerisms. Become more sensitive to the
    interactions he has with other people to make the interactions more
    feminine. Acting like a girl can often have as much mental impact as
    dressing like a girl in terms of how an individual is
    observed.[11]![](Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_18.jpg "fig:Dress_up_a_Boy_Like_a_Girl_Step_18.jpg")

## Tips

-   Find clothing and makeup colors that match or coordinate with his
    eye color.
-   Teach him how to walk comfortably in heels to naturally look like a
    girl.
-   Have him put lotion on after you shave him. His legs might be a bit
    dry from shaving for the first time.
-   If your friend feels like being a girl is more real and authentic,
    then it's possible your friend is a transgender girl. If so,
    encourage her to be herself, and do your best to help her take steps
    towards living everyday life like the girl she is (if it's safe for
    her to do so).[12][13][14]

## Warnings

-   Some boys may have mixed feelings about dressing as a girl. Talk to
    him openly about how he feels or make sure he has someone to talk to
    if he needs it.
