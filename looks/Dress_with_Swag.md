Swag refers to the way you look and present yourself, and it comes from
hip hop culture. When you dress with swag, you have a keen fashion sense
and confidence in your style. People who dress with swag have a detail
oriented view of their clothing that ensures they make a statement with
every outfit. Dressing with swag means you are proud to show off what
you’ve got.[1]

## Steps

### Making Over Your Wardrobe

1.  Clean out your closet of all old and outdated items. Get rid of
    items that don’t add to your
    style:[2]![](2780848_1.jpg "fig:2780848_1.jpg")
    -   Clothes with old stains, holes, tears, or otherwise falling
        apart should be discarded
    -   Items that are no longer trendy but still in good shape can be
        donated to thrift stores.
    -   Name brand items that don't add to your swag can be sold at
        consignment stores to increase your budget for new clothes.
2.  Pick a store to buy your clothes from. For name brand clothes you
    can go to the actual store and buy something, but there are other
    ways to get the clothes if you want to save some money. You can find
    new or gently used name brand clothes online from sites like eBay,
    craigslist, or online garage sales. Check out local thrift stores to
    find name brands at a fraction of the price. You can even
    participate in a clothing swap to give away your old clothes and get
    some new ones in return.[3]![](2780848_2.jpg "fig:2780848_2.jpg")
3.  Buy some name brand items. Name brand items can signify money and
    power, so having a few items to wear will portray you as being
    successful. Mix and match with store brand items to create more
    outfits with swag.[4]![](2780848_3.jpg "fig:2780848_3.jpg")
    -   Get a few name brand shirts.
    -   Buy one pair of name brand pants
    -   Invest in a high quality name brand pair of jeans.
4.  Get several classic clothing items. Having classic items in your
    closet to use as staples will help you easily put together outfits
    that have swag. There are a few staple items that help create
    multiple outfits:![](2780848_4.jpg "fig:2780848_4.jpg")

    -   A utility jacket
    -   A black dress, for girls
    -   Graphic Tees
    -   Jeans
    -   A hoodie
    -   A hat or beanie

### Accessorizing Your Closet

1.  Buy a stylish hat. Get a hat that makes you feel confident and
    comfortable. Experiment with wearing your hat different ways like to
    the side or the back to see how it makes you look and feel. It
    doesn’t matter what type of hat it is so long as you feel cool in
    it:[5]![](2780848_5.jpg "fig:2780848_5.jpg")
    -   A baseball cap
    -   A sun hat
    -   A beanie
    -   A cowboy hat
2.  Invest in a trendy pair of shoes. Shoes are a big part of an outfit
    and having popular shoes can be viewed as symbol of status. A name
    brand pair of sneakers are a definite must for dressing with swag.
    White sneakers are a great option because they will go with many
    different outfits.[6]![](2780848_6.jpg "fig:2780848_6.jpg")
    -   Wash or shine your shoes regularly.
    -   Choose a high quality pair of shoes that will last.
3.  Pick out a few pieces of jewelry or a watch. Having jewelry or a
    watch will add a flashy element to compliment your outfit. Gold or
    silver chains can help make your look complete. Name brand watches
    are a nice touch to convey high class for both genders. Kick up the
    swag with more jewelry:[7]![](2780848_7.jpg "fig:2780848_7.jpg")
    -   Large rings and earrings can add to your swag look.
    -   Heavy bracelets or multiple bracelets can be great for girls'
        swag.
