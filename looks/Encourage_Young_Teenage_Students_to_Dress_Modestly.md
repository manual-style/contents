What's the best way to get young teenagers to dress modestly when they
get caught up in the hype of trendy fashions that do not truly have
their best interest at heart?

## Steps

1.  Be aware that teenage fashions are influenced by many factors. These
    factors include things like race, class, culture, and gender. For
    example in an urban gang culture rife with ridicule a teenager may
    be seeking to not stand out. The associated style of dress may be a
    survival skill. When that person comes to school, she may seem to be
    trying to stand out when in reality she is doing the opposite.
2.  Improve the 'cultural capital' of young teenagers. Expose the young
    teenager to art, performances, plays, literature, museums, and other
    aspects of culture. Let them meet local politicians, businessmen,
    judges, doctors, lawyers, engineers, merchants, chefs, craftsmen,
    and factory workers. Take them to see architecture, historical
    sites, the beach, the mountains, the rivers, town hall, and the
    state capital. Let them try a variety of different foods, sports,
    games, hobbies, etc. Doing this will point out that there is much
    more to world the teenager lives in than simply the opposite sex and
    money. Eventually, the teenager's dress styles will reflect that as
    well.
3.  Set an example. Dressing your best and always being properly groomed
    is a vital part to creating a good impression. See the articles
    [Take Care of Your Clothes](Take_Care_of_Your_Clothes "wikilink"),
    or [Dress for Work](Dress_for_Work "wikilink").
4.  Discuss how to 'Dress to Impress.' For example, find a local store
    which may be running good deals on good clothing. wikiHow has an
    excellent article on [Dress Like a
    CEO](Dress_Like_a_CEO_(Men) "wikilink").
5.  Install a full length mirror so the teenager can really see what
    kind of image is being broadcasted. In 1955 one high school did this
    in a spot where most students passed during the day. Above the
    mirror was a sign that said: "Look at how you are dressed. Are you
    satisfied?" Other things done included student led assembly programs
    and student surveys with the results published in the school
    newspaper.
6.  Inform the teenager's parents of dress code policy before a student
    gets into trouble. Sometimes an ounce of prevention is worth a pound
    of cure.
7.  Employ emotional responses. A strong businessman saying something to
    the effect of "You might get sent to the principal's office at
    school for not dressing modestly. In the real world you might get
    fired for not dressing modestly." The emotional effect of such an
    experience may produce a drastic change.\[

## Warnings

-   Avoid molding the teenager into something they are not. This is only
    appropriate in the military where a lack of discipline may mean
    death or collapse of a nation. Instead give the teenager the tools
    they need to realize the appropriate manner of dress.
-   Be careful with media, especially televised media. Businesses pay
    big bucks to influence the way people, including (maybe especially)
    teenagers think. Because of this, televised media may actually
    reduce a teenager's ability to think and dress themselves.
    Forbidding media to the teenager is not generally a good idea, but
    being aware of and taking measures to limit media's influence is.
-   Avoid scolding. The dress may have to do with resistance to normal
    society being part of the teenager's personality. In this case
    scolding or even mentioning inappropriateness may have quite the
    opposite effect.
-   Be careful with dress codes. Dress codes are what not to wear. As
    quick and as radically as youth fashions change, the dress codes
    will have to change too. This makes teenagers unhappy and the code
    difficult to enforce. Plus there is the risk of being accused of
    "fascism".
-   Be careful with religion. Most religions do have people's best
    interest at heart and encourage modest dress. Take time with
    teenagers to explain reasons for modest dress. Simply doing
    something because it is the religious thing to do may detract from
    the religion. Instead, explain why the religion assigns dress the
    way it does.
