We've all seen that girl, who walks down the street looking
[confident](Be_Confident "wikilink"), good,
[stylish](Be_Stylish "wikilink") and you can tell she got dressed in
about 5 minutes, her hair has that *I did this in a rush* look - but you
can bet she spent about 3 hours in front of the mirror getting that *I
did this in a rush look*!! Here's how to achieve this look:

## Steps

1.  Do your hair in a way that say, "I'm not bothered". If you have
    straight hair, leave it loose and put some pretty bright bows in it,
    or extensions. When you are doing it in the mirror, try not to think
    how it will look to others, if you like it, that's all that matters.
    If you have curly hair, you have an awesome advantage!! Curly hair
    can be hard to manage, so look for Curl Perfecters or something
    similar to really make your curls stand out, and keep frizz at bay.
    You could get yourself a a side fringe, so, when you pull it up into
    a ponytail, you can have some hanging down in your face, so it looks
    like you did it
    quickly.![](Get_That_I'm_Not_Bothered_About_What_You_Think_of_Me_Look_Step_1.jpg "fig:Get_That_I'm_Not_Bothered_About_What_You_Think_of_Me_Look_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Choose shoes. Go for converses in bright colours like pink, bright
    green, bright blue or yellow. Also, go for dolly shoes that have
    little bows or cute motifs on them like cherries, or something
    similar. Avoid heels and
    boots.![](Get_That_I'm_Not_Bothered_About_What_You_Think_of_Me_Look_Step_2.jpg "fig:Get_That_I'm_Not_Bothered_About_What_You_Think_of_Me_Look_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Pick out a T - Shirt. You can find some amazing slogan tees in New
    Look. Go for bright ones like yellow, or green. Or, you could buy a
    plain yellow t - shirt, then add a purple strappy top on top!! Or,
    skip the strappy top, and just go for a bright colourful t-shirt, or
    slogan tees with random
    phrases.![](Get_That_I'm_Not_Bothered_About_What_You_Think_of_Me_Look_Step_3.jpg "fig:Get_That_I'm_Not_Bothered_About_What_You_Think_of_Me_Look_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Select a garment for your lower body. Three quarter lengths are a
    MUST. Match them with a a long yellow t - shirt and a brown belt
    over the t - shirt. If you're after a real I'm Not Bothered Look,
    you could add UGGS. Also, ruffled short skirts in lilac or blue work
    well. Wear with dolly
    shoes.![](Get_That_I'm_Not_Bothered_About_What_You_Think_of_Me_Look_Step_4.jpg "fig:Get_That_I'm_Not_Bothered_About_What_You_Think_of_Me_Look_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Identify and put on some appropriate accessories. Think [friendship
    bracelets](Make_a_Friendship_Bracelet "wikilink") that are very
    simple, a blue piece of string with a large bead on. You could even
    make one yourself. Wear it all the time. Also, try a couple of large
    clunky
    necklaces.![](Get_That_I'm_Not_Bothered_About_What_You_Think_of_Me_Look_Step_5.jpg "fig:Get_That_I'm_Not_Bothered_About_What_You_Think_of_Me_Look_Step_5.jpg")

## Tips

-   If you're a big converse fan, pair with some flared jeans - those
    with converses look really awesome.
-   Try no make - up. If you have got to wear make up, go for natural
    shades.
-   Be original! If you see someone wearing something that you like,
    never go and buy an exact replica, instead, think how you could make
    the look entirely your own :)

## Warnings

-   Some people may laugh or make fun of you, be ready for that.
