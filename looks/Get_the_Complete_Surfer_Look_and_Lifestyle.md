Loving that surfer vibe? Here's the way to fully achieve the look AND
lifestyle!

## Steps

### Looks

1.  For clothes, try shopping at anywhere that sells Roxy, Billabong,
    O'Neill and any other surfer brands. If you like a bit of a preppy
    surfer look, try shopping at Hollister. Don't just wear brands
    though, mix up your look with clothes from other
    stores.![](Look-Slim-in-a-Swimsuit-Step-13.jpg "fig:Look-Slim-in-a-Swimsuit-Step-13.jpg")
2.  For Shoes, Go for vans, toms, flip-flops or sandals - leather
    sandals are
    best.![](Prevent_Flip_Flops_from_Hurting_Your_Feet_Step_2.jpg "fig:Prevent_Flip_Flops_from_Hurting_Your_Feet_Step_2.jpg")
3.  For your skin, Try to use products with natural ingredients, like
    for example Liz Earle products. You will need a cleanser/face wash,
    toner (optional), a face scrub, a face masque or two and of course a
    moisturiser. Try to maintain a clean, healthy
    face.![](Make-Your-Skin-Lighter-Step-8-Version-2.jpg "fig:Make-Your-Skin-Lighter-Step-8-Version-2.jpg")
4.  Go for natural make-up. For example, typical everyday make-up would
    be: Foundation/Concealer (only if you need it), Brow pencil/shadow
    (if you don't have luscious full eyebrows), Mascara - you may need
    waterproof for when you're surfing, a bit of blush, bronzer and lip
    balm - preferably with SPF. And remember, you don't need to wear
    make-up
    everyday.![](Stop-an-Oily-Face-Step-15.jpg "fig:Stop-an-Oily-Face-Step-15.jpg")
5.  Tie your hair in braids or a bun at night after your shower and wake
    up to waves! Get a shampoo and conditioner that works for your hair
    and use treatments whenever you can. Buy salt spray to help with
    your surfer waves, or just make your
    own!![](Apply-a-Wig-Step-9-Version-2.jpg "fig:Apply-a-Wig-Step-9-Version-2.jpg")
6.  Go surfing as often as you can. You don't want to be a poser.

7.  Listen to Beach boys, Cody Simpson, The Surfaris... whatever you
    like.![](Use-Home-Remedies-for-Decreasing-Stomach-Acid-Step-27.jpg "fig:Use-Home-Remedies-for-Decreasing-Stomach-Acid-Step-27.jpg")
8.  Eat as healthy as you can. Try to drink of water everyday, eat lots
    of fresh fruit and oily fish (lots of omega-3 fatty acids, which are
    very good for you, come from oily fish, seeds and some nuts), plus
    seeds, nuts, and try to eat little sweet
    things.![](Get-Skinnier-Thighs-Step-2.jpg "fig:Get-Skinnier-Thighs-Step-2.jpg")
9.  Be a Fitness fanatic. You will obviously get fit from surfing, so
    there isn't too much to worry about. Why not try pilates, yoga and
    meditation classes? Dancing, or any sport to be honest, is fine. You
    might like skateboarding,
    too.![](Be-Fit-and-Sexy-Step-1-Version-2.jpg "fig:Be-Fit-and-Sexy-Step-1-Version-2.jpg")
10. Be happy and chilled. Have the hippie spirit, and always give things
    a go. You never know what you could be missing out
    on!![](Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
