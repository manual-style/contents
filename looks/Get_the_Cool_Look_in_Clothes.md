People go out and spend fortunes on clothes they think will look cool.
What they don't know is cool clothes are all in your closet!

## Steps

1.  Try to mix colors that will go well with each other eg. black and
    white, pink and black,purple and blue. If you can't think of
    anything use a neutral such as gray, brown, black, or
    white.![](Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Leggings can also go well with long shirts and jumpers, not only
    skirts or dresses. Try wearing them under
    shorts.![](Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Make your clothes match with your hairstyles eg. high ponytail with
    tracksuit, If you have your hair up you could wear earrings that
    would get caught if your hair was
    down.![](Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  If you feel your clothes are "dull", change that! Add a little you
    to your clothes. This could be glitter, iron-on designs, sewed on
    trim you created, cut waved ends at the bottom of your shirt, etc.
    You want your clothes to be a reflection of the true
    you.![](Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_4.jpg "fig:Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Clothes, mood, and attitude. A study showed that people who wore
    orange reflected them as a happy person. (Colours, mood, and
    attitude!) Wouldn't it be cool to be feeling happy and wearing
    it?![](Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_5.jpg "fig:Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Dress for occasion. Although a school uniform might be good for
    school, it's not in yard work. Yard work clothes may be comfy, but
    would you wear them to a job interview? Likely not. Different
    clothes can be for different occasions. It doesn't mean you can't be
    unique and appropriate
    though!![](Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_6.jpg "fig:Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Make your own styles. Your you, and you can come up with outfits you
    think are cool. Being yourself is definitely cool, so don't forget
    your clothes to be in a style that reflects
    you.![](Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_7.jpg "fig:Get_the_Cool_Look_in_Clothes_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Don't brag. The coolness between clothes and person comes from the
    heart. Many people lose coolness once they start to show off. Being
    confident and complimented truly is the best way to be cool,but
    still rock your outfit;no one else can ever have that outfit because
    you made it yourself
