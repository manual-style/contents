Thanks to media messaging, advertising and other social influences, many
teen girls think that exposing more skin is the only way to [look
attractive](Look_Attractive_(Girls) "wikilink"). Girls don't understand
that girls who dress immodestly will get attention, but not necessarily
in a good way. Teens who wear modest clothes can still [be
stylish](Be_Stylish "wikilink") and very attractive. You can help them
to realize this and to choose suitable clothing.

## Steps

### Role Models

1.  Look for modestly dressed stars on the internet. Teens can see how
    celebrity females with a modest dress sense tone down the look and
    still [look fabulous](Look_Fabulous "wikilink"). By seeing these
    role models, the girls can be persuaded that this is a great look
    too, and try to dress like
    them.![](Help_Teen_Girls_Choose_Modest_Clothes_Step_1.jpg "fig:Help_Teen_Girls_Choose_Modest_Clothes_Step_1.jpg")
    -   Some examples of celebrities who dress modestly (most, if not
        all, of the time) include: Kate Middleton, Mary Kate and Ashley
        Olsen, Taylor Swift, Adele, Kourtney Kardashian, Emma Watson,
        Janelle Monae, Lorde, Florence Welch, Solange, Zooey Deschanel,
        Emma Stone, Keira Knightley, Shailene Woodley, Erykah Badu, Evan
        Rachel Wood, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, Kelly
        Osbourne, Rachel Zoe, Elle Fanning, Kerry Washington, Eva
        Mendes, Dakota Johnson, Ariana Grande, Kirsten Dunst and Alexa
        Chung.[1]
2.  Show the teen girls pictures of what you consider to be
    inappropriate clothing. Ask the teen girls how they feel about such
    clothes. Ask them why they like the clothes or don't like the
    clothes. Ask them if they would wear those clothes in front of their
    family members and friends, and why or why not. Don't be judgmental
    or directive, just elicit discussion among the girls and find out
    their thoughts. It is important for them to reach their own
    conclusions.![](Help_Teen_Girls_Choose_Modest_Clothes_Step_2.jpg "fig:Help_Teen_Girls_Choose_Modest_Clothes_Step_2.jpg")
    -   Talk to the teen girls about the reactions of some people in
        society. Tell them about how certain people feel that it's okay
        to judge a woman by her clothing, believing incorrectly that
        immodest clothing is a reason to be disrespectful. Point out how
        skimpy clothing can leave bad impressions on some people and how
        there are certain people in society who may try to use it as an
        excuse to fail to control their own behavior. It is also
        important to discuss how this issue is complex and that while it
        is not right that society judges women by their clothing
        choices, it is important to be alert to this reality and to take
        care of oneself in terms of the messaging being portrayed to the
        less enlightened.
    -   Talk about age appropriateness of clothing. Discuss how the
        style of clothing is often considered more or less appropriate
        depending on a person's age. This will vary depending on
        cultural background and where you live in the world.
    -   Explain how modest clothing can sometimes be a form of shield or
        camouflage that gives the wearer breathing space to get on with
        what they're enjoying doing rather than having to worry about
        being stared at or objectified.
    -   Talk about what differences social opinion places on males and
        females with respect to dress. It can help teen girls to better
        understand that there is often a double standard with respect to
        clothing depending on the gender of the wearer.

### Shopping for Outfits

1.  Take the teen girls shopping. Look in different stores and choose
    items that the girls like. Have a picture of the star they chose as
    a guideline. If they choose an article of clothing that
    appropriately covers the girls, start letting themÂ experiment with
    their
    clothing.![](Help_Teen_Girls_Choose_Modest_Clothes_Step_3.jpg "fig:Help_Teen_Girls_Choose_Modest_Clothes_Step_3.jpg")
2.  Make sure all clothes are tried on before purchase. If your daughter
    chooses something that you consider to be too short/too revealing,
    then don't permit the purchase or refuse to fund it. The point of
    the shopping trip is for her to understand what more appropriate
    clothes are, following your discussion
    beforehand.![](Help_Teen_Girls_Choose_Modest_Clothes_Step_4.jpg "fig:Help_Teen_Girls_Choose_Modest_Clothes_Step_4.jpg")

## Warnings

-   Avoid simply stating that clothing is immodest, evil or bad. There
    is nothing more likely to drive a child towards something than you
    calling it forbidden fruit. A teenager is a young adult and can
    understand very easily a sensible discussion about the issues
    involved in clothing and the moral overlays of society provided you
    take the time and make the effort to do so. Do not expect a teen
    girl to simply accept your word or sense of judgment; to be
    persuasive, you need to let her think about this and work out much
    of it for herself. Provide facts, images and space for discussion.
