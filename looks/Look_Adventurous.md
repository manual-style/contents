Maybe you want to attract attention, or maybe you want to feel exciting,
or maybe you're doing it for a different reason. However, whatever your
reason, anyone can look adventurous. All it takes are a few steps.

## Steps

1.  Style your hair.Â  This is not just for girls, and thereÂ is no
    professionalÂ  help needed.Â Â Â Guys with short or shoulder-length
    hair, mess it up.Â Â Â Guys with long hair, put in in a ponytail tied
    lower down.Â Â  Girls with short hair, it should look slick.Â Â  Girls
    with medium length hair, a ponytail at the base of the neck looks
    good.Â Â  Girls with long hair, either let it hang free, put some
    braids in, or, again, a ponytail tied low.
2.  Make up (for females) - keep it natural.Â  Nothing that looks too
    artificial, exceptÂ  some dark blue, green or brown eyeshadow.
3.  Fake scratches (this is optional).Â Â  Use a fine red sketching pen,
    preferably dark, and draw a neat line.Â Â  Looks good on the cheek or
    the top corner of a face.
4.  Clothes: wear green, browns and blacks.Â Â  Khaki looks especiallyÂ
    good.Â Â  Shorts never hurt anyone, but polos are pretty much the
    plague here.Â Â  Guys, you can wear a t-shirt, but on girls something
    slightly more sophisticated, such as a sleeveless v-neck,Â looks
    betterÂ Â  The thicker the fabric, the better.Â Â  Girls, avoid
    miniskirts at all costs.Â Â Middle-length trousers are far better.Â Â
    Long boots are good for girls and guys, and have as many pockets as
    you can.
5.  Accesories (optional).Â Â  String bracelets, armlets and ankletsÂ for
    both genders,Â Â and on girls they look great with charms.Â Â  Nothing
    too fancy in the necklace category, maybe a wood or dark silver
    pendant.Â Â  If you're wearing a watch, make it leather.Â Â  For girls,
    if you have to have a handbag, sling it across your body.Â Â  Thick
    leather belts are great.

## Warnings

-   DO NOT try to look like you're in a gang, or are a criminal. It
    could get you questioned by police.
