An androgynous look is one that ignores gender binaries and embraces
both feminine and masculine qualities. Whether you want a more permanent
androgynous look or are playing with styles to see what you like, the
most important thing to remember is to choose the fashion, hair, and
makeup that make you happy.

## Steps

### Dressing Androgynously for Femmes And Feminine Looking People

1.  Stick with black, white, and gray. A truly androgynous look relies
    heavily on black, white, and shades of gray. While the occasional
    splash of color can amp up your look, you should typically stick
    with more neutral
    tones.[1]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_1_Version_4.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_1_Version_4.jpg")
2.  Wear loose bottoms. Tight pants will show off your curves and
    feminine figure, which is the opposite of what the androgynous look
    is about. Stick with pants that are a bit less fitted. Boyfriend
    jeans are a nice option and look great paired with a t-shirt and
    cardigan.[2]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_2_Version_4.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_2_Version_4.jpg")
3.  Pick an oversized shirt. A loose top will hide your figure better
    than something super fitted. Get a few men’s button-up shirts in a
    variety of colors or prints so that you can mix and match them with
    various bottoms. Try wearing a simple white button-up under a
    cardigan with a pair of boyfriend jeans and canvas
    sneakers.[3]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_3_Version_4.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_3_Version_4.jpg")
4.  Choose a boat-necked top. As far as necklines go, a boat-neck is
    perfect for the androgynous look as it is a mix of masculine and
    feminine. Pair a printed boat-neck top with corduroy pants and
    oxfords for a chic androgynous
    style.[4]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_4_Version_4.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_4_Version_4.jpg")
5.  Wear a vest. Vests are a great way to add style to your basic
    pieces. Layer a vest over a plain or printed top and pair it with
    neutral pants and boots. Add a watch to complete the
    look.[5]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_5_Version_4.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_5_Version_4.jpg")
6.  Choose a blazer. Pick a blazer in a fun print and layer it over a
    plain shirt. Add boot-cut jeans and a canvas sneaker to keep it
    casual, or pair it with black pants and oxfords for a dressier look.
    Also pick up a blazer in a neutral color, like navy, to pair with
    bold or printed tops and
    bottoms.[6]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_6_Version_4.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_6_Version_4.jpg")
7.  Wear masculine fabrics. Choose some items in traditionally masculine
    fabrics, like tweed, corduroy, or leather. Fabrics that are a bit
    heavier, more structured, and don’t conform to the shape of your
    body will help you complete your androgynous look.

### Dressing Androgynously for Masculine Looking People

1.  Wear fitted bottoms. Rather than opting for baggy pants, choose a
    more fitted bottom. You can choose skinny jeans or well-fitted dress
    pants. Wear a cardigan over a t-shirt paired with skinny jeans and
    canvas sneakers for an everyday androgynous
    look.[7]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_8_Version_4.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_8_Version_4.jpg")
2.  Try harem trousers. Harem trousers have a partial skirt around the
    waist and taper toward the ankle. If you’re ready for a bold look,
    try pairing harem trousers with a fitted button-up
    shirt.[8]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_9_Version_4.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_9_Version_4.jpg")
3.  Choose tailored tops. Fitted tops are great for masculine looking
    people who want the androgynous look. Rather than wearing a loose
    t-shirt, pair a tailored top with your favorite jeans. Add canvas
    sneakers or oxfords to complete the
    look.[9]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_10_Version_4.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_10_Version_4.jpg")
4.  Wear a blouse. Blouses are flowy tops that may be gathered at the
    waist or hips. They are often sheer or made from fabrics like linen
    or satin. It’s not as uncommon as it once was for men to wear
    blouses, and even Gucci recently developed a line of men’s blouses.
    Pair a blouse in a bold color with fitted pants in a neutral
    tone.[10]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_11_Version_4.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_11_Version_4.jpg")
5.  Add a floral print. A floral print can add a feminine touch to your
    overall look. You can wear floral pants with a white button-down, or
    pair corduroy pants with a floral top. Finish the look with a
    portfolio or briefcase and a great
    watch.[11]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Wear feminine fabrics. Choose items made from traditionally feminine
    fabrics, such as lace, silk, satin, and velvet. Pair a velvet blazer
    with skinny jeans and canvas sneakers, or dress it up with fitted
    black pants and
    oxfords.![](Look_Androgynous_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")

### Adding Accessories

1.  Add a leather belt. Choose a leather belt in black or brown for a
    versatile, chic accessory. Wear it in the traditional style, or
    sling it low around your
    hips.[12]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_14_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_14_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Invest in a pair of oxfords for formal attire. Oxfords are an
    androgynous staple. Pick a pair in brown or black, and wear them
    with jeans or dress
    pants.[13]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_15_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_15_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Wear canvas sneakers for a casual look. Canvas sneakers can be worn
    with nearly any outfit. Get two pairs, one in a neutral color, and
    one in a fun print or with a bit of bling so you have a pair to
    coordinate with any
    outfit.[14]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_16_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_16_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Add a hat. Hats are the perfect accessory for the androgynous look,
    as many are gender-neutral. You can go for a fedora, newsboy cap,
    trapper, or even a baseball hat. Try wearing a newsboy cap with a
    button-up, jeans, and
    oxfords.[15]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_17_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_17_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Wear a large watch. Choose a bold, chunky, metallic watch to
    compliment your androgynous look. Pick one with a bit of bling, or
    stick to a simple style. Alternatively, choose a wooden watch for a
    trendy but natural look. Roll up the sleeves on your button-up or
    cardigan to show off your
    watch.[16]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_18_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_18_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Choose a portfolio or briefcase. As far as bags go, a portfolio -- a
    combination of a briefcase and a purse -- is the perfect mix of
    feminine and masculine. Choose a leather portfolio in a neutral
    color like black or brown so you can use it every day.
    Alternatively, choose a briefcase in a fun fabric, such a suede, or
    a bold color or
    pattern.[17]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_19_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_19_Version_2.jpg")

### Wearing Androgynous Makeup

1.  Use foundation and concealer minimally. Use matte powder to create a
    natural look and hide blemishes. Avoid adding a full face of
    foundation or bright eyeshadow or
    lipstick.[18]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_20_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_20_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Go for a bold brow. People with features traditionally thought of as
    masculine can tweeze their eyebrows for a more feminine shape.
    People with features traditionally thought of as feminine should
    allow their brows to grow out naturally, or brush their brows upward
    for a bushier, boyish look. Fill in your brows but stick to their
    natural shape. Concentrate on the outer ends of your
    brows.[19]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_21_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_21_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Choose neutral eye shadow. A neutral eye shadow can help blur the
    gender lines. Choose a neutral color of matte shadow or amp up your
    look with a glossy shadow in a color close to your skin
    tone.[20]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_22_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_22_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Add eyeliner. Black eyeliner will make your eyes pop. Line either
    just the top or the top and bottom, but avoid the cat-eye look as it
    is traditionally feminine. Choose liquid eyeliner for a bold look or
    pencil eyeliner for a more subtle
    look.[21]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_23_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_23_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Wear a neutral lip gloss. Glossy, subtle lips are a great way to get
    the androgynous look. Swipe on a clear gloss or choose a rosy gloss
    to add some color. You can also wear a tan or beige lipstick for a
    truly neutral
    look.[22]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_24_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_24_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Play up your masculine features if you have features traditionally
    thought of as feminine. A chiseled jaw is often seen as a masculine
    feature. Sweep a matte bronzer along your jawline to add definition.
    Avoid highlighting traditionally feminine features, such as high
    cheekbones.[23]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_25_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_25_Version_2.jpg")
7.  Play up your feminine features if you have traditionally masculine
    features. Highlight your cheekbones with a shimmery blush.
    Experiment with contouring to create a slender neck and less-defined
    jaw
    line.[24]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_26_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_26_Version_2.jpg")

### Creating an Androgynous Hairstyle

1.  Chop off your locks. Though you don’t have to have short hair to get
    the androgynous look, you may want to go all in. Consider a pixie
    cut or even a buzz cut or a shaved
    head.[25]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_27_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_27_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Slick your hair back. Slicked back hair can ramp up the edginess of
    your look. Use gel or pomade to create a sleek and shiny
    style.[26]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_28_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_28_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Wear a curly mohawk. Your hair doesn’t need to be short or slick for
    an androgynous look. Embrace your curls and add a bit of edginess to
    your look by styling your locks into a faux-hawk. You can also shave
    the sides of your head for a true
    mohawk.[27]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_29_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_29_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Try the shag look. Androgynous icon Joan Jett was famous for her
    shaggy hairstyle. Both men and women can embrace the shag look. As a
    bonus, it’s a versatile, low-maintenance style that you’re likely to
    love.[28]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_30_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_30_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Color your locks. Don’t be afraid to add a pop of color to your look
    by tinting your hair. You can add subtle highlights or go for a bold
    color like purple. Experiment with different options to see which
    you like
    best.[29]![](Look_Androgynous_Step_31.jpg "fig:Look_Androgynous_Step_31.jpg")
