Do you want to look like an awesome girl without overdoing it? If so,
then you have clicked on the right article! All of these steps are VERY
easy to achieve.

## Steps

### Get the Attitude Down

1.  Don't be mean! Be nice and friendly if you can, but if someone gets
    under your skin, let your ferocity loose.

### The Style

1.  Have a natural hair style. Avoid fancy ponytails or perfect buns.
    Select something less cumbersome such as hair down, a quick
    ponytail, or a messy braid.
2.  Don't worry about keeping your nails clean. Aside from making sure
    you don't have piles of crud under your nails. Use clear or dark
    polish, or maybe none at all. If you do want to use nail polish
    heavily then that's ok too, but some people may take you less
    seriously.
3.  Wear combat boots. Doc Matrins, Vans (WITH laces), or Chuck Taylors
    (high top or low).
4.  Wear the right jeans. The best types of jeans are distressed (ripped
    and/or stained), loose-fitting or skinny jeans. Don't go for baggy
    pants or light bell bottoms. They can be light, dark, black, or more
    seriously colored. Don't go for things like bright pink or white
    wash though. This makes you look like you're going for a girly rock
    look that's failing. That just makes you look like a poser.
5.  Wear a variety of cool shirts. An ideal selection includes graphic
    tees, plain tees that are a single dark color or plain white,
    t-shirts of your favorite bands, medium to loose-fitting sweaters,
    long sleeves with a tee over it, or spaghetti-strap tank tops.
6.  Have lightly colored lips. You can try light lipstick, lip balm, or
    tint. (optional) It's possible to pull off a darker color, but this
    tends to make you look more punk instead of just badass, unless
    that's what you are looking for. In that case, some things in this
    how-to can still help.
7.  Wear minimal makeup. Focus mostly on your eyes, try different
    techniques such as smokey eyes, cat eye or winged eyeliner.
    Sometimes thick liner without a cat or winged effect can still look
    hardcore. You can pull off more color variations of eyeshadow, but
    this can be difficult to achieve.

### Have a Squad of *Loyal* Friends

1.  You can ride solo but most like to have friends. You can have as
    many friends as you want, but don't let them change you or make you
    into a really bad person. Remember, it's not what they can provide
    you with, but it does matter on how they make you feel.
2.  Listen to "tough" types of music for example:
    -   Dubstep
    -   Death metal
    -   Rock
    -   Rap
    -   80s Goth
    -   Classic Rock
    -   Whatever else you're into. Everybody has a soft side, so don't
        forget it's not a bad thing to listen to sad, slow, or romance
        music!
3.  Accessorize with jewelry or hats. Let your personality shine through
    by adding things like:
    -   Bracelets
    -   Chain necklaces
    -   Chokers
    -   Bandanas
    -   Snapback hats
    -   Beanies or toques
    -   Statement making rings
4.  Go along with most of these tips and you will definitely be seen as
    badass!
