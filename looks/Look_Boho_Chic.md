“Boho Chic” describes a style that includes flowy clothing, vintage and
ethnic-inspired accessories, and natural-looking hair and makeup. The
phrase became popular in 2002, when Australian journalist Laura Demasi
used it to describe the eclectic gypsy look that was then in vogue.[1]
Although it's been over 10 years since Demasi's article, Boho Chic is
still a popular style.

## Steps

### Choosing Boho Chic Clothing

1.  Choose clothing in natural tones and fabrics. When building your
    Boho Chic wardrobe, choose items made from natural fabrics such as
    cotton, linen, velvet, chiffon, silk, leather, suede, and
    fur.[2]![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   You'll also want to choose items in natural tones and colors —
        for example, white, beige, brown, earthy reds and oranges, and
        dark greens.
    -   Note that wearing fur is considered by many to be cruel and
        unethical. If you like the look but don't want to wear real fur,
        there are many good faux fur clothing items available.
2.  Say yes to lace, crochet and other embellishments. Crocheted and
    lace dresses, tops, hats, and bags are staples of Boho Chic. Beads,
    fringe, and embroidery are also hugely popular, and can appear in
    your clothing and your
    accessories.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
3.  Experiment with fun patterns. Boho Chic clothing comes in many
    patterns: floral and avant-garde-style accents are popular, as are
    checks and ethnic-inspired
    prints.[3]![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   If you do experiment with fun patterns, be sure to pair them
        with relatively neutral items for a balanced outfit.
4.  Think comfort. A key ingredient in Boho Chic style is comfort —
    you'll see a lot of soft, loose-fitting, flowy clothes, often worn
    in
    layers.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Maxi dresses (full-length, usually loose-fitting dresses) are a
        great example of the flowy comfort common to Boho Chic.
    -   Cut-offs and a flowy white lace top paired with a long, beige
        knitted sweater is another example of a comfortable Boho Chic
        outfit.
5.  Combine fitted and flowy clothes. Not everything you wear has to be
    flowy — you can combine flowy shirts with fitted pants or skirts, or
    vice versa. Here's an example of an outfit you could wear in colder
    months, when the rain and snow make flowy dresses and skirts
    impractical:![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Pair some faded, fitted light-blue jeans with a white chambray
        top and a big, knitted, neutral-toned sweater.
    -   Add interest to the outfit with a long silver-chain necklace
        punctuated by a pretty stone pendant — turquoise would work
        well.
    -   You could also combine this outfit with a colorful, jewel-toned
        scarf.
    -   For shoes, go with brown, tan, or beige ankle boots with a
        relatively low, chunky heel. (Think cowboy boot heels.)
6.  Wear shoes in natural shades and fabrics. Ballet flats and
    ethnic-inspired sandals (i.e. Greek, Roman, or African) are the
    generally accepted staples of Boho Chic. For cooler weather, you can
    wear cowboy boots, ankle boots with thick heels, or high
    '70s-inspired
    boots.[4]![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_6_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_6_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Leather and suede are the preferred fabrics for shoes; natural
        shades such as beige, tan, and brown are recommended.
    -   If you're vegan, it's possible to buy convincing vegan “leather”
        versions of natural leather shoes.
7.  Avoid neon. Bright colors are great for adding heat to your Boho
    Chic outfit; just make sure they're colors you would find in nature
    — for example, jewel tones like ruby red or sapphire blue, or the
    bright green-blue of a clear mountain
    lake.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_7_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_7_Version_3.jpg")
8.  Don't go overboard. With all the patterns and layers available,
    building a Boho Chic outfit can be daunting. Avoid the temptation to
    wear all of your favourite things at once. You'll also want to avoid
    being too colourful: aim for mostly neutral tones plus one or two
    accent
    colors.[5]![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_8_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_8_Version_3.jpg")
    -   It's also important to consider textures. Wearing patterned
        pants with a lace top and a crocheted fringe vest would
        definitely be going overboard.
    -   Similarly If you're wearing a beaded top, it may be overkill to
        wear a bunch of beaded necklaces with it.
    -   If you're unsure of what sort of color combinations to use, an
        online search for “Boho Chic color combinations” will return a
        lot of creative suggestions.
9.  Dress for your body type. If you're curvier, look for items with
    more structure, as flowy items and layers can make you look bigger
    than you
    are.[6]![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_9_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_9_Version_3.jpg")
    -   If you're thin and short, you may get lost in long, flowy
        layers; aim for shorter tops and/or skirts, slimmer fits, and
        shoes with heels.[7]

### Accessorizing

1.  Know that accessorizing is a must. Boho Chic is all about layers,
    and accessories are an important part of
    this.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_10.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_10.jpg")
2.  Wear bracelets. Bracelets are a must-have for the Boho Chic style.
    Thin silver bangles and colorful, woven Mexican bracelets are
    amongst the most popular types. For a creative twist, you could also
    wear wooden
    bangles.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_11.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_11.jpg")
    -   You can wear bracelets on your ankles (i.e. anklets) too! Thin,
        dangly silver ones are nice.
    -   You can also wear bracelets (also known as armbands) on your
        upper arms: braided and metal armbands are popular.
3.  Wear dangly earrings. Boho Chic earrings are dangly and often
    combine metal and natural stones. They can also include feathers and
    leather. As with everything that is Boho Chic, seek out natural
    shades and
    materials.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_12.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_12.jpg")
4.  Wear a necklace. Boho Chic necklaces range in lengths, but what
    they're composed of is generally the same: natural materials and
    colors.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_13.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Leather, metals, stones, shells, fringe, cottons and wools are
        common materials. (These are also common materials for earrings
        and bracelets.)
    -   Ethnic-inspired pieces are particularly popular.
5.  Get at least one hat. Fedoras and floppy, wide-brimmed hats are
    popular in Boho Chic, as are crocheted caps. Floppy, wide-brimmed
    hats in neutral tones are often paired with long dresses, or with
    flowy tops and short
    shorts.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_14.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_14.jpg")
6.  Buy a headband. Floral headbands were hugely popular in summer 2015.
    Other types of head pieces that are popular include braided
    headbands and chain
    tiaras.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_15.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_15.jpg")
    -   [Tying scarves](Tie_a_Headscarf "wikilink") or bandanas around
        your hair or wearing them as headbands is also popular.
7.  Get a colorful handbag. Colorfully patterned handbags as well as
    handbags with fringe and tassels are popular Boho Chic choices. As
    with everything Boho Chic, aim for natural fabrics and
    shades.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_16.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_16.jpg")
8.  Wear vintage-style sunglasses. Big sunglasses in varying shapes are
    key elements of Boho Chic. Round glasses and aviators are quite
    popular, but anything big and vintage-looking will do — choose what
    looks best on your
    face!![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_17.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_17.jpg")
9.  Don't overdo it. Select your accessories carefully, taking your
    entire outfit into consideration. You want to make sure that a) your
    accessories match the tone of your outfit, and b) they aren't
    competing with each
    other.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_18.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_18.jpg")
    -   You don't need to wear five necklaces with big stone pendants on
        them: just choose the one that looks best with your outfit.
    -   You probably don't want to wear a chain tiara with jeans and a
        simple white top. It would be more appropriate with a summery
        maxi dress.

### Doing Your Makeup and Hair

1.  Buy makeup in neutral shades. The idea is to look natural without
    appearing washed out. To figure out what shades of makeup to buy,
    look at your face when you're
    flushed:![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_19.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_19.jpg")
    -   After working out or doing something that gets your heart rate
        up, have a look at your face. What color are your cheeks and
        lips? These are the colors you want to aim for in doing your
        Boho Chic makeup.
2.  Ensure that your skin looks even and unblemished. If you have
    perfect skin, lucky you! If you're like the rest of us, you'll want
    to put some concealer on any breakouts, and perhaps even put a
    foundation on your whole
    face.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_20.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_20.jpg")
    -   If your skin is pretty smooth, with only some light redness, try
        a tinted moisturizer, BB cream or CC cream instead of a full
        foundation. This will help even out your skin without being too
        thick or cakey.
    -   If your face is shiny, apply a light powder foundation. Do it
        with a brush instead of the applicator to help it spread more
        evenly.
3.  Apply a highlighter. Highlighting balms and powders are wonderful
    for adding a bit of extra glow to your face. Apply it to the inner
    corners of your eyes (the skin beside your tear ducts), your upper
    cheekbones, and in that little V-shaped dip where your philtrum
    meets your
    lips.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_21.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_21.jpg")
    -   If you're feeling adventurous, you can also apply a highlighter
        to other parts of your face, such as your chin and forehead.[8]
4.  Apply blush to your cheeks. Once your face looks clear, add some
    light blush to your cheeks. Smile and apply a light dusting of blush
    from the apples of your cheeks outwards, following the natural curve
    of your
    cheek.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_22.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_22.jpg")
    -   When applying blush, think youthful radiance, not post-intense
        workout.
    -   A little bit of blush along the bridge of your nose will help
        give you a sun-kissed look — just don't go overboard lest you
        wind up looking sick, with a red nose.
    -   If you're tanned or have darker skin, you can use a bronzer
        instead of blush.
5.  Play up your eyes. Boho Chic makeup ranges from neutral to smokey
    eyes. For a more traditional Boho Chic, look, wear shades that play
    up your eyes without making it obvious that you're wearing
    makeup.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_23.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_23.jpg")
    -   Earthy browns, reds, and golds are popular paired with a
        non-clumping black mascara on curled lashes.
    -   If you do go for a more dramatic look on your eyes, stick with a
        neutral lip, otherwise you'll risk looking overly made up.
6.  Have healthy-looking lips. If you wear nothing else on your lips,
    wear lip balm to keep your lips looking soft and
    juicy.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_24.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_24.jpg")
    -   If you want to wear lipstick, choose something that looks
        natural on you.
    -   Glosses, stains, and moisturizing lipsticks in pink, peach, and
        wine and berry shades are popular.
    -   Avoid vibrant matte lipsticks and sparkly glosses — these will
        look unnatural on your lips.
7.  Go for a natural look with your hair. Boho Chic hair is most
    popularly shown as being long and wavy, and in natural browns, reds,
    and
    blondes.![](Look_Boho_Chic_Step_25.jpg "fig:Look_Boho_Chic_Step_25.jpg")
    -   If you don't have long hair, don't worry, just aim for a
        hairstyle that looks classic — ideally not spikey, razored, or
        shaved.
    -   Loose braids and loose waves are amongst the most popular styles
        worn.
    -   If you insist upon flat ironing your hair, give it a bit of
        curve at the bottom so that it doesn't look unnaturally
        straight.

## Tips

-   If it looks like something a hippy or tribal belly dancer would
    wear, it's probably a good choice for Boho Chic.
-   For inspiration you can do an online search for Boho Chic and hippie
    outfits. Some good search terms include “Coachella Boho Chic” and
    “Woodstock 1969 fashion.” Note that not all of the outfits you'll
    see in these searches will be DOs — a lot of them will be DON'Ts!

## Warnings

-   Make sure your eclectic outfit matches. There's a fine line between
    Boho Chic and looking like you tried to put on every piece of
    jewelry you own.
