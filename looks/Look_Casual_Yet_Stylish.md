Want to look stylish but casual at the same time? Well here are some
tips that will make it happen!

## Steps

1.  [Have a shower](Take_a_Shower "wikilink") before you go to bed. That
    way you will smell nicer,look better and feel better when you wake
    up.![](Look_Casual_Yet_Stylish_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Casual_Yet_Stylish_Step_1.jpg")
2.  If you go to bed early, have one in the morning. If you have to go
    to school early then try to have a shower after you do your
    homework, eat dinner,
    etc.![](Look_Casual_Yet_Stylish_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Casual_Yet_Stylish_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Lay out your clothes before you go to bed. Wear something that
    you're comfortable in, but that looks
    good.![](Look_Casual_Yet_Stylish_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Casual_Yet_Stylish_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Wear something that's fit for the season. If it's summer wear
    shorts, and if it's winter wear
    pants.![](Look_Casual_Yet_Stylish_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Casual_Yet_Stylish_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Create a natural makeup look. Wear tan colored eye shadows that give
    a sparkle in your eyes. Brown mascara looks good on anybody, so
    apply a medium think layer of that. Just enough to make your eyes
    pop naturally. Eyeliner is optional, but don't apply it too dark, or
    just apply brown instead of black. Some clear shiny lip gloss with
    some glitter gives your face a finished look. Tip: It's never good
    to cake makeup on your face.

## Tips

-   If you own make up, wear it. For those who aren't that
    comfortable/good at makeup, a coat of mascara and a coat of lip
    gloss is enough to make you look pretty without being OTT.

## Warnings

-   Don't overdo the outfit! Don't wear something overly fancy that
    doesn't fit the occasion - this is just asking for attention.
-   Don't go for tiny skirts and tops that let it all hang out. There is
    a difference between stylish and slutty, and the Jodie Marsh look
    isn't a good one!
