## Tips

    fall off, which is embarrassing. Anything too small will restrain
    your breathing and movement and give you aches and cramps.
-   If you feel cold, pull on socks or slippers over your feet to keep
    them warm.

## Warnings

-   NEVER shower or bathe during a thunderstorm. You can easily get
    electrocuted. This also goes for home telephones, washing machines
    and dryers, dish washers, microwaves, and toasters.

## Things You'll Need

-   Anything to wash with.
-   Hairbrush
-   Toothbrush
-   Deodorant
-   Cute, comfy clothes
