Weekends are for resting and relaxing. However, even if you want to be
casual and comfy, you still want to look good! This article is designed
to teach you how.

## Steps

1.  Attempt to look stylish, even on the weekends. Get rid of the "it's
    the weekend, I don't care" attitude and make an effort. Good clothes
    for this include sweatshirt-chic sweatshirts, hoodies, black-tie
    sweats (think Juicy Couture), and that pair of your favorite
    jeans.![](Wear_Tank_Tops_Step_5.jpg "fig:Wear_Tank_Tops_Step_5.jpg")
2.  Rock the messy-sexy hair look. A mussed-up bun is great, and it
    hides the fact that your hair is
    unwashed!![](Be_the_Alpha_Girl_of_Your_School_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_the_Alpha_Girl_of_Your_School_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Stick to the basics for makeup: concealer, eyeliner, and lip gloss.
    This is all you need because with the concealer your skin will look
    even, with the eyeliner your eyes will stand out and not get lost in
    your face, and the lip gloss will just make your lips look
    good.![](Be_the_Alpha_Girl_of_Your_School_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_the_Alpha_Girl_of_Your_School_Step_4.jpg")

## Tips

-   Although some weekends you'll want to be casual, on others maybe
    you'll want to experiment a little fashion-wise. You can take more
    fashion risks on the weekends and not worry as much as you would if
    you were at school or work.
-   A popular look is to have a tight-ish T-shirt and some (ripped)
    comfy, old, slightly baggy jeans. Add straightened, messy hair.
-   Don't spend too much time on hair or makeup; weekends are for
    relaxing! The minimalist look can still be cute.
-   When applying eyeliner, apply it right along your lower lash line
    and inside the upper lash line. Although minimalist, this makes your
    eyes stand out in the best way possible so that they won't get lost
    in your face.

## Warnings

-   Never look sloppy just because it's the weekend. You never know who
    you might run into!
