Do you have the problem that either your mom doesn't want you to wear
cool things, or you can't afford new clothes? Resolve this problem in no
time at all as you discover a cool and fun way to look casual and cool
without disappointing your mom or yourself.

## Steps

### Working out what you have already

1.  Know your closet. What items have you got? What colors are they? How
    many items have you got? All these things are important to assess in
    the transitional process of becoming cool and casual
    looking.![](Create-Your-Own-Dress-Style-Step-1-Version-2.jpg "fig:Create-Your-Own-Dress-Style-Step-1-Version-2.jpg")
2.  Donate items that you don't think are cool or casual in style.
    Anything that has holes or is worn out needs to go into the rag bag
    too.![](Dress-in-Simple-Alternative-Fashion-Step-1-Version-2.jpg "fig:Dress-in-Simple-Alternative-Fashion-Step-1-Version-2.jpg")
3.  Ask older siblings for suitable hand-me-downs. This saves money and
    you can totally make them your own with some mixing and matching of
    styles.![](Create-Your-Own-Dress-Style-Step-4-Version-2.jpg "fig:Create-Your-Own-Dress-Style-Step-4-Version-2.jpg")

### Choosing clothes to look cool and casual

1.  Choose clothes representative of you that are also cool and casual
    in style. Here are some tips on what you might like to
    wear:![](Be-a-Fashionista-Step-12.jpg "fig:Be-a-Fashionista-Step-12.jpg")
    -   Leggings. All types of leggings are okay, but try not to go too
        sparkly, glittery and over the top with them.
    -   Cute tops. White, pink, blue, purple, black or white are great,
        but really any color is fine. Long sleeves are a very good
        choice, and T-shirts are also very good. It would also be nice
        if you were to wear a band T-shirt, or a graphic T-shirt. Try
        not to go sparkly or glittery with the tops though. If you want
        to have some sparkles, then wear it with jewellery.
    -   Jeans. All types of jeans. skinny jeans, short jeans, flare
        jeans, big jeans or torn jeans. but nowadays people wear
        skinnies more than the other types. Anything is okay. Black
        jeans or the original blue jeans are a very good choice.if you
        are a colored jeans addict, then pastel pink/blue/purple/yellow
        would look great on the right top.
2.  Choose quality over quantity when buying new clothes. You'll not
    only save money in the long run but the items will look better on
    you
    too.![](Dress-in-Simple-Alternative-Fashion-Step-4-Version-2.jpg "fig:Dress-in-Simple-Alternative-Fashion-Step-4-Version-2.jpg")

### Adding accessories

1.  Accessorize. Cute dinky little charms on your phone are cute. Don't
    go over the top with necklaces though. The necklaces should be
    preferably short. If you want to do a kesha then use glitter and
    sparkles on some studs or kind of short earrings. charm bracelets
    are a big yes
    yes.![](Dress-As-a-Bohemian-Step-1-Version-2.jpg "fig:Dress-As-a-Bohemian-Step-1-Version-2.jpg")
2.  Wear hats. Everyone loves a hat! Beanies and pompom hats are lovely.
    Don't go too crazy with the colors though. Aztec prints on hats are
    cool as
    well.![](Dress-in-the-American-1950s-Fashion-Step-7-Version-2.jpg "fig:Dress-in-the-American-1950s-Fashion-Step-7-Version-2.jpg")

### Fixing your hair to look cool and casual

1.  Do your hair in a cool and casual way. For cool and casual hair,
    braids are perfect. Learn how to do the fishtail braid, or just a
    regular braid, for they add a lovely touch to your outfit! Avoid
    extreme curling or extreme straightening.

2.  Go natural. If you want to dye your hair, dye it a light shade of
    brown or blond or if you are light-skinned. If you are dark, try a
    dark plum/auburn/burgundy or a dark
    brown.![](Bleach-Your-Hair-Step-32.jpg "fig:Bleach-Your-Hair-Step-32.jpg")
