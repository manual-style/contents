## Steps

### Wearing Cute Outfits

1.  Wear cute [clothes](Dress_Cute "wikilink"). Wearing cute clothes is
    the key to being cute. You don't have to change everything in your
    wardrobe to be cute -- instead, just work on acquiring a few cute
    items that tie all of your clothes together in a cute way. Here are
    some ways to wear cute
    clothes:![](Look_Cute_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Wear skirts and dresses instead of pants or shorts when you can.
        Cardigans, knit sweaters and vests, boot-cut jeans, and t-shirts
        with cute patterns like hearts or polka-dots, are cute forms of
        clothing.
    -   Don't wear anything that feels too tight or uncomfortable. Part
        of being cute is feeling comfortable in your own skin.
    -   Wear light and positive colors. Wear pastels like purple, pink,
        or a shade of blue. Anything soft and pretty will make you look
        cute. Avoid dark colors like black, brown, or dark blue.
    -   Try wearing something with a floral pattern. Floral patterns are
        the essence of cute.
2.  Wear cute shoes. Your shoes should complement your cute clothes, to
    complete the cute look from head to toe. Wear shoes that are stylish
    and trendy. Couple with brightly-colored or patterned socks or
    tights. Follow these shoe tips to make your feet look
    cute:![](Look_Cute_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Wear clogs, moccasins, or close-toed shoes with a round toe.
    -   Wear flat sandals and pair them with cute pastel-colored nail
        polish.
    -   Wear furry boots.
    -   Wear pastel or white-colored sneakers with pastel shoelaces.
    -   Wear a classy wedge heel or kitten heels; they're both cute.
3.  Wear cute accessories. Cute accessories can help tie your cute
    outfit together. You don't have to be weighted down by accessories
    -- just pick a few accessories that really make your outfit stand
    out. Here are a few accessories that will make you look incredibly
    cute:![](Look_Cute_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Wear a cute chunky pink ring.

        floral pattern.

### Having a Cute Face and Cute Hair

1.  Wear lotion to make sure your face stays
    hydrated.![](Attract-the-Opposite-Sex-Step-9-Version-2.jpg "fig:Attract-the-Opposite-Sex-Step-9-Version-2.jpg")
2.  Wear cute [makeup](Apply_Makeup "wikilink"). Wash your face and have
    good hygiene. To look cute, don't go too heavy on the makeup -- the
    right makeup will go a long way. Here's what you should
    wear:[1]![](Look_Cute_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Wear just a tiny bit of blush.
    -   Wear soft pink lipstick or lip gloss.
    -   Wear light eyeshadow in pastel shades like light blue, purple,
        or even light pink.
    -   Just a light layer of mascara and eyeliner will do for the eyes.
    -   Aim to look natural. You can wear a bit of makeup, but you'll
        only be cute if you look like yourself.
3.  Have cute hair. Have your hair frame your face. Your hair should
    look soft and natural, and be free of any heavy styling products.
    Here are some things to
    try:[2]![](Look_Cute_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Let your hair dry naturally and fall to your shoulders.
    -   Fix your hair in a cute, comfortable style. Some nice styles
        are, ponytails, braids, buns or even just down with a clip or a
        headband. Or, wear your hair in two loose pigtails that fall in
        front of your shoulders. Or, put your hair in a low messy bun,
        with a few strands hanging over your eyes.
    -   Consider getting bangs if you don't have them. Bangs are cute.
    -   Put colorful clips, baubles, or pastel-colored headbands in your
        hair.
    -   Curl your hair in little ringlets.
4.  Smell cute. Wash your hair and body regularly, at least daily. Use
    nice-smelling shampoo and conditioner and body wash. Use scents like
    strawberry, vanilla, coconut, lemon, mint and lavender. They help
    relax the mind and you'll smell
    delicious!![](Look_Cute_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")

### Acting Cute

1.  Use body language to your advantage. Your body language will tie
    your whole look together, and someone will be able to tell that
    you're cute just from the way you smile or the way you're sitting.
    Here are some ways to express cuteness through your body
    language:[3]![](Look_Cute_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Play with a strand of your hair.
    -   Fiddle with your bracelet or necklace.
    -   If you're sitting, keep your feet together and your hands in
        your lap.
    -   If you're standing up, shift your weight from foot to foot.
    -   Break [eye contact](Make_Eye_Contact "wikilink") from time to
        time. Though you should keep eye contact to maintain a
        conversation and show you care, you should look at the floor or
        at your hands once in a while to show that you're humble.
    -   Cover your mouth when you laugh. This is cute. Cover it when you
        sneeze; this is polite and prevents spreading germs.
    -   If you're a touchy-feely person, give the person you're talking
        to the occasional light touch on the shoulder or knee.
2.  Speak in a cute way. This adds to the whole cute aura. Here's how to
    speak so as to appear
    cute:[4]![](Look_Cute_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Talk softly. This will make everything you say sound more
        important because people will have to lean in to hear you.[5]
    -   Laugh often. Laughing and giggling while you talk is cute. Don't
        overdo it.
    -   Listen patiently and speak when it's your turn. Butting in
        before a person has finished speaking is not cute.
3.  Act demurely. Being humble or demure is a major part of being cute.
    You can be humble while being sweet, friendly, and bubbly at the
    same time. You can still be fun and social while being demure, as
    long as you're not loud or overbearing. Here's how to act
    demurely:[6]![](Look_Cute_Step_9.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_Step_9.jpg")
    -   When you engage in conversation, act very
        [innocent](Be_Innocent_and_Cute "wikilink"). Don't tell dirty
        jokes, engage in racy conversations, curse, or be vulgar.
    -   Learn to blush from time to time. If you're genuinely
        embarrassed by a topic, it will be very cute if you blush.[7]
    -   Don't dominate. You can still be a part of a conversation
        without fighting to be the center of attention. Being pushy,
        rude, or bossy to be the star of every show is not cute.[8]
4.  Avoid forcing your cuteness. None of this should be forced. Let it
    come naturally. If you look happy and sincerely provide compliments
    to other people, they will think of you as nice and may classify you
    as "cute".![](Look_Cute_Step_10.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_Step_10.jpg")

## Tips

-   You're never too old to be cute.
-   If you wear earrings and you want your clothes to be the focus, wear
    some sort of earrings that don't stand out but match your outfit.
-   Wear cocked lenses in any color except for black. These will make
    your eyes look bigger, which makes you look cute. Or, get glasses in
    any color and push out the lenses for a super cute look.
-   Go to bed at a reasonable hour. This keeps you from getting cranky
    and stops you from getting less-than-cute dark circles under your
    eyes. A person who sleeps well is a joy to behold.
-   Use ribbon and tie your up into a low bun. Apply ribbon to your hair
    as if tying your shoe - it can look cute and is very fashionable.
-   [Be Yourself](Be_Yourself "wikilink") don't let others to tell you
    who to be.
-   Smile at all times!
-   If you catch someone looking at you start smiling cutely and look at
    something slightly tilting your head.
-   A loose braid looks really cute no matter what colour of hair you
    have.
-   Just be yourself no matter how short, tall, skinny, or fat you are.
    Comb your hair every day, morning, and night.
-   Add cute accessories to your bookbag, or handbag, or your hair.
    Hello Kitty accessories are very cute, but make sure you like what
    you buy, and donâ€™t waste your money.
-   Try keep your eyes wide open sometimes. Smile and open your eyes
    wider. We think babies and small animals are cute, sometimes itâ€™s
    because their eyes are big and attractive.
-   Even when it's hard just be cute but nice never try too hard . Your
    are already awesome! ðŸ˜Ž.

## Warnings

-   Don't be fake. High squeaky voices might be cute on kids, but when
    you're 17 and attempting it, it's just annoying.
-   Don't go overboard with too many colors. Just pick two or three and
    stick with those. Mainly because you want the colors to complement
    each other!
-   Don't have too many accessories; have just enough to make the outfit
    look complete.
-   Don't be irritating, and remember that the most important thing is
    to stay true to yourself.
-   Avoid using vulgar language. However, an expletive when you're in
    pain or upset by something dastardly someone has done to you reveals
    that you're as human as everyone else.
