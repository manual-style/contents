With so many fun and unique styles and options available, it’s easy to
feel down when clothes or accessories don’t make you feel your best. Not
all bodies are the same, so finding pieces that [work for your
shape](Dress_for_Your_Body_Type "wikilink") can seem a bit overwhelming.
If you’re heavy set, focus on choosing flattering pieces, strategically
styling and accessorizing your look, and selecting the right
undergarments. Then, you’ll be able to create outfits you love that will
make you look and feel great – no matter what your size is!

## Steps

### Choosing Flattering Clothing Pieces

1.  Keep your clothing neutral in places you feel insecure. If you tend
    to feel more self-conscious about a particular part of your body,
    try selecting pieces that have more neutral colors and patterns.
    While patterned and bright-colored clothing pieces can be fun to
    wear, they also tend to draw attention to that part of your body.
    Going with clean, simple pieces for the heavier parts of your body
    will keep the focus on the places you want to
    accentuate.[1]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_1.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_1.jpeg")
    -   If you’re a man and you tend to carry weight in your upper body,
        for example, for work attire, try a solid-colored jacket with a
        lightly striped shirt. The stripes on the shirt will add a bit
        of visual interest while the solid jacket will help slim out
        your frame.[2]
    -   For example, if you’re a woman and you’re top-heavy, you could
        try a fitted v-neck sweater in a subtle, neutral color paired
        with a dark pencil skirt or patterned high-waisted skirt. This
        will keep the attention away from your top and focused on your
        waistline.[3]
    -   While neutral pieces will draw the eye elsewhere, if you feel
        cute in a patterned piece, go for it! The most important thing
        is that you feel good in whatever you decide to wear.
2.  Go for pieces that are fitted along your natural waist. When
    shopping for pieces that’ll make you look and feel cute, focus on
    finding shirts, dresses, tops, and skirts that cinch in at your
    natural waistline. Regardless of your body type, cinching at your
    waist will help define and flatter your
    figure.[4]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_2.jpeg")
    -   For example, if you’re a woman, go for a fit and flare dress
        with a fitted top and an A-line bottom that cinches at the
        waist. The fitted top will streamline your body while the volume
        of the A-line bottom will accentuate your cinched-in natural
        waistline.[5]
    -   If you’re a man, take the time to find button-downs and jackets
        that cinch in at your waist a bit to help define your waistline.
        If you have a hard time finding items that fit well in your
        upper body, taking items you already own to a tailor is a great
        option.[6]
3.  Choose good quality dark wash jeans with a bit of stretch. Unlike
    lighter wash, thinner fabric jeans, which can bring attention to all
    the curves on your lower half, good quality, thicker, dark wash
    jeans help elongate your legs and slim out your lower half. While
    having a bit of stretch is important to ensure that you can move and
    be comfortable, good quality, thicker denim fabric can help smooth
    out or disguise any bulges or bumps you’re hoping to
    conceal.[7]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_3.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_3.jpeg")
    -   In addition, whether you’re a man or a woman, try to keep any
        rips or embellishments to a minimum. While these can give your
        denim a cool, funky vibe, they will also draw the eye down to
        your legs and midsection.[8]
4.  Look for tops with a v-neck to slim out your chest area. If you have
    a large or wide chest area, you’ll likely want to avoid tops with a
    straight-across neckline. Instead, look for tops with a v-neck to
    draw the eyes vertically up and down rather than horizontally, which
    could emphasize the width of your chest. With a v-neck, whether
    you’re a man or a woman, you’ll create a longer, leaner vertical
    silhouette.[9]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_4.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_4.jpeg")
    -   V-neck tops also provide a bit of visual interest to your upper
        body, which can help draw attention away from areas you’re
        hoping to conceal.
    -   If you’re a woman, straight necklines may push your chest
        together into that undesirable uniboob look.
5.  Wear a high-waisted pencil skirt to elongate your whole body. If
    you’re a woman, pencil skirts are a great option for a versatile
    piece that will both show off your curves while making your body
    look long and lean. The high-waisted fit covers up any extra tummy
    weight, helping you feel cute and confident. When choosing a pencil
    skirt, however, make sure that it’s not too tight, as this can cause
    some unwanted bulging or
    puckering.[10]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_5.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_5.jpeg")
    -   Pair a pencil skirt with a simple button-down for work, or try a
        loose crop top for a night out with friends.
    -   As a general rule of thumb, if you can see the line of your
        undergarments, the skirt is likely too tight.[11]
6.  Select pants with a wide waistband to slim out your midsection. When
    shopping for pants or trousers, focus on options with a waistband
    that is about thick. Unlike options with a skinny waistband, pants
    with a wide waistband won’t dig into your sides or your belly, which
    can be both unflattering and very
    uncomfortable.[12]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_6.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_6.jpeg")
    -   For the most flattering fit, look for pants with a wide
        waistband that sits either right at your belly button to cover
        your belly, or higher to accentuate your natural waist line.
    -   Many wide waistband pants also come with a wide belt, which can
        give you an extra layer to shape and conceal any extra
        weight.[13]
7.  Try a jumpsuit with an adjustable waistband for a flattering trendy
    look. Whether you’re looking for a comfy outfit to wear to run
    errands or a trendy look for dinner with friends, if you’re a woman,
    a jumpsuit with an adjustable waistband is a great option. The
    adjustable waistband will allow you to decide how loosely or tightly
    you want to cinch your waist in, while the fuller coverage of the
    jumpsuit allows you to cover aspects of your body that you’re
    insecure
    about.[14]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_7.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_7.jpeg")
    -   Look for options in thicker fabrics with a bit of stretch, such
        as a spandex/cotton blend, so you’ll feel both cute and
        comfortable.
    -   Try a jumpsuit with long or ¾ length sleeves if you feel
        insecure about your arms.
8.  Go for a pair of high-waisted, looser shorts for a summer-ready
    option. Higher-waisted shorts help smooth out your midsection,
    keeping any bulges or love handles tucked in. In contrast to more
    structured shorts, such as denim shorts, shorts made of a flowy
    fabric with a looser fit will prevent them from being too tight on
    your legs. As a result, they’ll make your legs look longer and
    leaner.[15]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_8.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_8.jpeg")
    -   If you’re a woman, pair your higher-waisted shorts with a tank
        top that flares out a bit for a loose yet streamlined fit.[16]
    -   If you’re a man, try wearing your shorts with a stylish,
        lightweight short-sleeve button-down in a fitted style. The
        lightweight fabric will keep you from sweating while the fitted
        style will keep your outfit from looking too baggy.[17]
    -   Flowy style shorts often come with an elastic waist, making them
        more comfortable to wear and preventing them from digging in to
        your sides and tummy.

### Styling and Accessorizing Your Look

1.  Wear a belt to help define your waist. Whether you’re a man or a
    woman, adding a belt is a great way to define your waistline and
    accentuate your figure. Depending on your outfit, you could choose a
    wide belt to make your waist look extra slim, or a skinny belt to
    add just a bit of
    definition.[18]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_9.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_9.jpeg")
    -   For a particularly comfortable option, try a belt with an
        adjustable back or elastic waistline.[19]
    -   If you’re a woman and want to add a bit of pizzazz to your
        outfit while still flattering your figure, try a belt with
        embellishments, such as jewels, stitching, or metallic
        hardware.[20]
2.  Accessorize with a thicker, long necktie to elongate your
    midsection. When choosing a tie to wear to work or for special
    occasions, opt for ties that are at least wide and that are long
    enough to hit right at your waistband. This will help slim out your
    upper body and hide your belly if it protrudes out a
    bit.[21]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_10.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_10.jpeg")
    -   While skinny ties can look trendy and you should certainly try
        out the style if you want, they could make your upper body
        appear wider than it is.
3.  Use statement jewelry to highlight your best physical qualities. To
    look cute when you’re a heavy set woman, try wearing statement
    jewelry strategically to help you balance out your outfit and draw
    attention away from the parts of your body you want to conceal. If
    you’re insecure about your upper arms but you’re planning to wear a
    sleeveless dress, for example, try accessorizing with thick, enamel
    bangles. Not only are these bracelets on-trend, they’ll draw
    attention away from your upper arms and down to your
    wrists.[22]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_11.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_11.jpeg")
    -   Wearing long, chandelier earrings is a great way to both
        elongate your neck and draw attention up to your face and away
        from your lower body.
4.  Try highlights or lowlights to make your hair look light and fresh.
    Whether you have blond, brown, black, or red hair, a single block of
    the same hair color can weigh you down. Therefore, talk to your hair
    stylist about trying out highlights or lowlights. This will give
    your hair a bit of visual interest and depth, making your whole look
    appear a bit
    lighter.[23]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_12.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_12.jpeg")
    -   Lowlights and highlights will also help cover up any grey hairs
        that might start to spring up over time.
5.  Go for pointy-toed shoes to elongate your legs. While they may not
    always be the most comfortable option, pointy-toed shoes are great
    way to make you look instantly slimmer. The pointed-toe on the shoes
    will make your silhouette appear longer and
    leaner.[24]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_13.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_13.jpeg")
    -   If you’re a woman, pointy-toed heels will help elongate your
        legs.
    -   If you have thicker ankles or calves, avoid styles with t-straps
        or ankle straps, as these can cut off your leg line and make
        your legs appear shorter and wider.[25]
    -   To make your legs look even longer, go for nude shoe that’s
        close to your skin tone.
6.  Avoid tiny bags and purses that aren’t proportional to your body.
    While they look cute on the shelf at the store, carrying a small bag
    or purse runs the risk of making your body look larger than it is.
    Since you’ll generally carry your bag over your shoulder so that it
    falls at your waist, choose a medium to large bag that will make
    your waist look smaller by
    comparison.[26]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_14.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_14.jpeg")
    -   While you want your bag to make your waist look smaller, an
        extra-large bag will only hide your figure. Instead, choose an
        outfit that makes you feel cute and use your bag to further
        accentuate your beautiful figure.[27]

### Selecting the Right Undergarments for Women

1.  Get a professional [bra](Buy_a_Well_Fitting_Bra "wikilink") fitting
    to avoid squeezing or bulging. Visit a lingerie or department store
    and ask about getting a professional to measure you for a bra.
    Wearing the wrong size bra is one of the most common mistakes that
    women
    make.[28]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_15.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_15.jpeg")
    -   Wearing a bra that’s too tight can squeeze your body and cause
        unwanted bulging across your back and chest. Therefore, it’s
        important that you get professionally measured for a bra to
        ensure that you get the right style and size for your body.
    -   Even if you think you know your bra size in one style from one
        brand, your size may be completely different in another style or
        brand.
2.  Wear shapewear to smooth out your curves. [Wearing
    shapewear](Wear_Spanx "wikilink") under your clothes is a great way
    to smooth out your body and boost your confidence. Even if you
    choose the most flattering pieces of clothing, it can still be
    helpful to have that extra layer to help you smooth out and conceal
    any areas you feel insecure about. Plus, there are several different
    types and styles of shapewear, so you’ll likely be able to find the
    right kind for your
    outfit.[29]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_16.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_16.jpeg")
    -   For example, if you’re wearing a fitted dress and want to smooth
        out your whole body, try a shapewear bodysuit.
    -   If you’re looking for shapewear that you can wear with almost
        any outfit, try a biker short style. This style reaches up to
        your natural waist at the top and down to your mid-thigh or
        knees at the bottom, effectively creating a long, smooth, lean
        line all the way down your midsection.[30]
3.  Put on a bralette to cover up excess cleavage. If you have a large
    chest and want to tone down your cleavage, try wearing a simple lace
    bralette under your top. While bralettes don’t generally provide a
    lot of support, it will give you a bit of extra fabric up top to
    cover up your bust and give you a more streamlined
    look.[31]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_17.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_17.jpeg")
    -   If you need more support for your bust, try getting a bralette
        in a larger size so you can wear your bra underneath.
4.  Invest in a slimming bodysuit that can double as a top. Unlike a
    separate top, which can ride up throughout the day, bodysuits tend
    to stay securely in place all day. In addition, there are several
    bodysuits available with built-in shapewear that will smooth out
    your tummy without having to add bulk or layers with a separate
    shirt.[32]![](Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_18.jpeg "fig:Look_Cute_When_You're_Heavy_Set_Step_18.jpeg")
    -   Bodysuits go great with a pair of high-waisted trousers or flowy
        shorts, as well as a high-waisted a-line skirt.

## Tips

-   When experimenting with a new look, try taking photos of your outfit
    instead of just relying on the mirror. This will help you see your
    look from a different point of view, allowing you to better assess
    whether you feel cute or want to change something. Then, once you
    find a look you feel great in, you can save the photos in a file and
    refer to them later when you’re having trouble deciding what to
    wear.[33]
-   If you find something you love but the fit isn’t quite right for
    your body, try taking it to a tailor. While retailers are carrying
    more sizes and styles that work great for heavy set shoppers, it can
    still be challenging to find an outfit that makes you feel cute.
    Tailoring is a great way to get around this and make an item work
    for you.[34]
