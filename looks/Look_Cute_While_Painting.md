When you are painting it can get a little crazy. Especially if you are
with your friends. So here is how to look good with all that chaos going
on!!!

## Steps

1.  Choose old clothes that you won't miss but that are still cute. Pick
    an old t-shirt and some shorts that already have a stain. Or if you
    can't find anything, go to a local thrift store and get a cheap
    outfit just for painting in. If you can't go to a thrift shop, look
    through some old clothes and see what you can
    find.![](Look_Cute_While_Painting_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_While_Painting_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Put on your best *waterproof* makeup (for girls). When you are
    painting with your friends, there is a 90% chance that you will end
    up covered in paint. Once you are covered in paint your going to
    wash it off. But you don't want your makeup to come
    off!!![](Look_Cute_While_Painting_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_While_Painting_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Make sure your shoes are not your favorite so if they get ruined it
    won't matter. Also wear old
    socks.![](Look_Cute_While_Painting_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_While_Painting_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Wear a headband or headscarf that you don't care whether it gets
    paint on it, and put your hair in a bun. This will help so hairs
    won't come out and stick to the walls. Especially if you get pushed,
    it will be up and out of the
    way.![](Look_Cute_While_Painting_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_While_Painting_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
