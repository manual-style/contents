Sometimes, it can be difficult to express yourself and not, well, suffer
the consequences! But there is a way to show your personality off while
still keeping your integrity and respect safely in your back pocket!

## Steps

1.  Clean up so you can dress up. Go through your wardrobe and separate
    clothes that are school-appropriate from clothes that you could not
    wear to school. Separate absolutely everything that, by itself,
    would not be
    appropriate.![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_1.jpg")
2.  For hanging clothes, either put these two sets of clothes on two
    different racks or use some sort of barrier or something that will
    divide the clothes and be seen easily. (You could even use
    different-colored
    hangers!)![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_2.jpg")
    -   For clothes in drawers, simply have piles for school on one side
        and piles for outside school on the other side,
        etc.![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_2Bullet1.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_2Bullet1.jpg")
    -   If your clothes are spread across your floor, make an attempt to
        find them all and either hang/fold them accordingly, or at least
        separate them into piles so that you will remember what is
        wearable.![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_2Bullet2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_2Bullet2.jpg")
    -   Some important things you should remember in being
        school-appropriate are size, fit, coverage, condition, rips/torn
        seams/edges, implications, (up to date and at least faintly
        stylish) and a possibility of disrespect, threatening, etc. By
        this time, you may feel the need to throw out some clothes that
        you can't wear anywhere/fit into anymore, or just *really* don't
        like! That will clear up some closet space for current and new
        clothes that you will like and will fit you. (You can also go
        through jewelry, shoes, makeup, etc. and clear some stuff out,
        about the same way) All that will make it impressively easy to
        work on your
        style!![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_2Bullet3.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_2Bullet3.jpg")
3.  Look at the clothes you can wear to school and determine what you
    like about them and what you would like even better. Pay special
    attention to clothes you are lacking (e.g. if winter is approaching
    and you need some scarves, gloves, sweaters, an/or turtlenecks, it
    is probably time to put those at the top of your 'to buy' list), so
    that you will have plenty of fashionable clothes for every
    season!![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Figure out what the most consistent/important thing about your style
    is, so you can find appropriate clothes that have that quality. If
    that would be chains and pointy things, consider an alternative,
    like a really cool (but slightly dark and secluded?) belt or design
    on your clothes that follows school/other guidelines. Confusing
    amounts of jewelry, layers, fluff, etc., see-through clothes,
    awkwardly inappropriate quotes, designs, or implications are a no-go
    too. Those also probably won't express your style as much as
    becoming reasons to put you in a small, dark corner (Just kidding!)
    or basically, limit other people's respect for you. So for example,
    if you like flowers look for fun floral patterns that don't all look
    the same size/outdated and look for some on shirts, or maybe sew
    some onto your pants! If you like bright colors, use layers to show
    off your colorful personality, or find ensembles that don't
    overwhelm (like lime green and blue for example!) but still show off
    several
    colors.![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Get the goods! Once you figure that out, many of you may want to go
    shopping, which is a good thing if you need to, esp. right before
    school starts! There are good buys and good-byes for every type of
    clothing.![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5.jpg")
    -   Shorts:![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet1.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet1.jpg")
    -   Very cute with little beads, sequins, or other colorful designs
        on them, esp. on pockets. These can come with a cute belt too!
        Fringe, patches, and jewels can be cute
        too.![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet2.jpg")
    -   If you can't find any cute shorts that are long enough for
        school, even after checking a few stores, you can always look
        for Bermuda shorts (shorts that come about the knee but not
        below).![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet3.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet3.jpg")
    -   Go to the boys section and grab some shorts! Long, loose, and
        possessing plenty of pockets these are a dream come true, and
        when paired with a tighter (non-baggy) top can be quite
        cute!![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet4.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet4.jpg")
    -   If none of those work out, see
        Capris.![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet5.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet5.jpg")
    -   Skirts: Be very careful that you don't buy skirts that do one of
        the
        following:![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet6.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet6.jpg")
    -   Let anything show when you bend over, move a lot,
        etc.![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet7.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet7.jpg")
    -   Are higher than where the tip of your middle finger is when your
        shoulders are relaxed (this is important, but more of a
        guideline of you have really long
        arms).![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet8.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet8.jpg")
    -   Are really
        tight![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet9.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet9.jpg")
    -   Blow up when the wind blows, especially if you won't have a free
        hand to keep it down (if so, shorts of some sort should be worn
        underneath, or it should be/be made into a
        skirt.)![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet10.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet10.jpg")
    -   Provoke a lot of boys! Bad for school, no matter how much you
        love attention from them. However, there can be many cute
        shapes, lengths, and designs on these, like pastels or black and
        white, along with lots of different fabrics too! The
        possibilities are
        endless.![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet11.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet11.jpg")
    -   Are *really* plain, and are *really* long with a straight-lined
        bottom edge. Unless your parents make you, you don't need to
        dress like an Amish
        person!![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet12.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet12.jpg")
    -   Capris: Pretty much always cute, ties or other additions at the
        bottom are fun, and rolling is a good
        option.![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet13.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet13.jpg")
    -   Pants: Skinny jeans are in but jeans in general are fine, but
        stay away from the extreme mom jeans and go towards somewhat
        low-rise pants that don't get smaller at the bottom.
        Bell-bottoms that don't stick out a whole lot are especially
        nice. And these come with belts and other things too! (See
        shorts) make sure these go at least below your ankle, and longer
        is best with boots/high
        shoes.![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet14.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet14.jpg")
    -   Shirts: T-shirts with little phrases in the middle are fun, long
        is currently in, with a lot of 'tattoo-like' designs all over
        them. You can be that casual and still cute as long as the shirt
        isn't really tight OR really loose. Also, you can get very fancy
        with different types of layers, sleeves, bottom lines and
        necklines. T-shirts are hot on high, round necklines, and
        fancier shirts (that would be school appropriate) showcase the
        V-shaped neckline and include but are not limited to (not cut
        after purchase, but pre-cut and sewn) cut sleeves up the
        shoulder, three-quarter sleeves, button-ups, and
        more!![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet15.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet15.jpg")
    -   Hats: If allowed at school, brim caps, jockey caps, baseball
        caps, beanies/beanie caps, visor hats, newsboy caps, etc. are
        ‘hot’.![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet16.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet16.jpg")
    -   Shoes: There are a lot of shoes out there… so choose wisely. Go
        for comfort, good looks, and sensibility. Heels are good but
        pumps usually aren’t… sneakers are good but not if you draw on
        them too much… and flip-flops are cute in different styles, some
        sporty, some sparkly. Look for shoes that go with more than one
        outfit to keep on a
        shelf.![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet17.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5Bullet17.jpg")
6.  Try em' on, then try em' out. Try different outfits on together to
    see what you can combine. If you have too many shirts, and two are
    similar but go with only one set of bottoms, take one out, and keep
    one if you like. Make sure every top has a bottom that matches, and
    vice versa. Once you found the clothes you like, check out a few
    accessories that go with more than one outfit. Then you are pretty
    much
    set!![](Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_6.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_and_Modest_at_the_Same_Time_Step_6.jpg")

## Tips

-   Sometimes keeping it simple can be a good thing. You can get a
    little fancy, but lots of fur, shiny things, colors, layers, and
    frills can turn off the good look you were hoping for and cause
    people to get a deer-in-the-headlights look whenever they see you...
    which isn't a good thing! But not too much though...Also, being
    caked with makeup, spikes, and/or skulls isn't very appropriate. If
    that is what you are into, keep away from a lot of skulls and what
    was mentioned above. Basically, overdoing the good things can look
    just as bad as what isn't school appropriate.
-   Add your own personal touch with jewelry, but dump the bulk. A
    matching bracelet and necklace or a few subtle necklaces can make a
    big statement. Try not to buy TOO many shoes, but have a pair for
    each type of outfit you own (e.g. a pair of boots for jeans, a few
    pairs of flip-flops, tennis shoes for when you are on the move,
    etc.) Look for some fun, and maybe original earrings. These can
    almost always make a statement about who you are. Belts can go the
    mile... and can be made from anything-even bottle caps, or a
    marquee!
-   Don't go crazy on the clothes, but make sure you have enough clothes
    for the school year. And try to buy clothes you will want to wear
    for several years, or until they don't fit. Buy clothes that will
    fit you for a while, but make sure that includes when you buy them!
    Don't keep clothes that don't fit appropriately either, that can
    fill your head with doubts. Dress sensibly, but fashionably if you
    like and confidently! School rules don't keep you from wearing
    fun/cool clothes altogether!
-   If you have another store in mind, google that (usually the name and
    then .com)or the name of the store and catalog (e.g. Old Navy
    catalog.) You can even subscribe for updates by email on new trends
    and freshly-shipped in designs.
-   Have fun with different fabrics (silk, cotton, wool, etc.), colors
    (so many combos, so many more ensembles), and shapes. The fashion
    world is your oyster! Layers can be fun too... with jackets, tanks,
    and tees, whatever will please!
-   If you have a small budget to work with, Old Navy has cheap prices
    ranging from $1-$35 and has sales all the time. Walmart and Target
    are even cheaper but may not have your style or very much choice.

## Warnings

-   Don't wear something over a tank that is uncomfortable or that you
    may take off, dress for everything. Especially Physical Education...
    but probably bring a bag with your P.E. clothes in it so you aren't
    sloppy and sweaty all day.
-   If you are a guy, most of these tips on the actual clothes section
    will not suit you... excepting button-ups, phrase shirts, Capri,
    etc. The catalogs or your friends and family are your best fashion
    tips but remember pink is still pretty in, and so are bright colors!
