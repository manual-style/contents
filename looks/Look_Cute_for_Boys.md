Looking cute is something many girl wants to achieve. Achieving a cute
look all boys will like isn't hard at all. Get started at step number
one below.

## Steps

1.  Learn to accept yourself for who you are. Before someone can like
    you, you need to like yourself. When you look in the mirror, do you
    like what you see? If you do, that's great! If you don't, try
    pointing out things that you do like about yourself. You may have
    great hair, or maybe pretty eyes. Focus on the beautiful things, and
    expand on
    those.![](Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_1.jpg")
    -   [Be Yourself](Be_Yourself "wikilink"). Never change who you are
        for someone else. Even if you feel like there's nothing special
        about you, there is something deep down inside that is
        beautiful. Let that blossom, and learn to accept who you
        are!![](Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_1Bullet1.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_1Bullet1.jpg")

### Whatever your definition of beauty is, make it happen

1.  Clear up your skin. You can look beautiful with acne but If you have
    acne, or are prone to breakouts, clearing up your skin can
    definitely be helpful. Wash your face with a face wash twice a day,
    once in the morning, and once at night. Use a good moisturizer,
    preferably with SPF in it. Be careful not to use a harsh face wash,
    because these can irritate and dry out your face. If you have dark
    marks, invest in a good dark spot corrector. These can take a while
    to fade, but be patient, in the end, it will work
    eventually.![](Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_2.jpg")
    -   Avoid touching your face with your hands, especially if they are
        not clean. Touching your face with dirty hands leads to
        pimples.![](Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_2Bullet1.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_2Bullet1.jpg")
    -   If you have bangs, try pinning them back. Bangs can trap dirt on
        your forehead, leading to huge
        breakouts.![](Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_2Bullet2.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_2Bullet2.jpg")
2.  Be clean. If you smell something stinky, it may be you. Try bathing
    once or twice a day. Use a nice smelling soap and shampoo, but don't
    use harsh products that will dry your skin out. Brush your teeth
    three times a day. Clean teeth, and fresh breath are a great
    help.![](Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_3.jpg")
    -   If you are old enough, or are allowed to, shave your legs. Hairy
        legs can be a big turn off. If you are nervous about shaving
        your legs, get help. Don't attempt to shave your legs if you
        don't know how
        to.![](Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_3Bullet1.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_3Bullet1.jpg")
3.  Take care of your hair. When you look at someone, you usually look
    at their hair. Frizzy, dry hair, isn't very cute, so take good care
    of your hair. Moisturize daily if you can. Comb your hair gently,
    being careful not to rip or tug at
    it.![](Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_4.jpg")
    -   Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo. Avoid washing your hair
        everyday, because this will strip it of its natural oils,
        leading to dry, frizzy hair. Always condition after
        shampooing.![](Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_4Bullet1.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_4Bullet1.jpg")
4.  Try makeup. Don't go crazy with the makeup. Keep a cute and fresh
    look, not cakey or crazy makeup. A little mascara, a kiss of
    lip-gloss, and a dash of eye shadow, and your set! If you are the
    daring type, don't be afraid to experiment! Winged eyeliner, and
    bright red lipstick look
    beautiful!![](Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_5.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_for_Boys_Step_5.jpg")
