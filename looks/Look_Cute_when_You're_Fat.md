Just because you're a larger girl, doesn't mean that you have to dress
any different than other girls! Here's a guide to help you look and feel
your best!

## Steps

1.  Make your hair [shine](Add_Shine_to_Your_Hair "wikilink")! The first
    step to looking great is your hair. Beautiful hair will attract
    anyone and make any girl look and feel amazing! Feel free to color
    your hair or cut it in a style that you think looks great! (You can
    even ask a hairstylist what kinds of haircuts will accentuate your
    personal face
    shape).![](Look_Cute_when_You're_Fat_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_when_You're_Fat_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Try wearing clothes that are well-tailored, or dresses with an
    empire waistline or a nice belt to accentuate the slimmest part of
    your waist. Remember that darker colors are flattering, so bring out
    your rich gem tones! However, if you see something in the store that
    you really like, then go ahead and get it! You should wear whatever
    makes you feel great, not necessarily always what you think you look
    good in, or what you think that you "should" be wearing because
    you're larger.

3.  Accessories can really pull together an outfit and set a focus
    piece. Jewelry looks great on everyone, and there are plenty of
    stores that you can get cute pieces for
    cheap!![](Look_Cute_when_You're_Fat_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_when_You're_Fat_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Get the right shoes. Don't hurt your feet by trying to squeeze into
    uncomfortable shoes, and always get footwear that has plenty of
    support.![](Look_Cute_when_You're_Fat_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_when_You're_Fat_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Wear makeup! So what if you don't have a 24-inch waistline? A pretty
    face will make you attractive to the kind of people you want to be
    around. A natural look looks good on anybody; remember, less is
    more!![](Look_Cute_when_You're_Fat_Step_5.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_when_You're_Fat_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Smile, and look happy and friendly. Nobody looks pretty when they're
    scowling.![](Look_Cute_when_You're_Fat_Step_6.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_when_You're_Fat_Step_6.jpg")

## Tips

-   You are a beautiful person, and your weight does not define you!
-   Dress and wear makeup to make yourself feel pretty, not for the
    benefit of other people.
-   You're not allowed to call yourself fat if it isn't affecting your
    health, and neither is anyone else. Don't take that kind of crap.
    It's coming from people you don't need to be around.
-   Everyone has a different "healthy size." Yours may be larger, and
    that's nothing to be ashamed of!
-   You don't owe anyone a tiny waistline.
-   Healthiness is far more important than skinniness.
-   Remember, wear what you feel comfortable wearing or the makeup that
    you think looks good on you!
-   If dieting healthfully will make you feel better, do it! If doing a
    moderate and healthy amount of exercise will make you happier, do
    that, too!

## Warnings

-   Don't put yourself down! Consistent self-deprecating thoughts like
    that will affect your health, happiness, and, yes, beauty.
-   If you do diet, be aware about the first signs of an eating
    disorder, and make sure you're dieting healthfully.
-   Don't make your weight the focus of your life.
-   No matter how much you weigh, or how much people will put you down,
    remember that you are beautiful, and you are far better than those
    harsh words!
