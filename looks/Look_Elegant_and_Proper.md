    yourself.![](Look_Elegant_and_Proper_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Elegant_and_Proper_Step_2.jpg")

## Tips

-   The #1 part of being a lady is how she acts. You could look a
    thousand dollars, yet be terribly rude. Make sure you are genuine
    and calm in every situation.
-   Don't think sports aren't proper. Sports are a great way to keep
    active. You could be in ballet to football. Just remember to dress
    appropriately and keep you cool at all times.
-   Be comfortable. Don't buy flats that give you blisters, but look
    good. You should be comfortable at all times.
-   Don't dress to impress others, dress to impress yourself.
-   Remember to be yourself! Alter these steps and make them more you.
    You do not have to stop wearing your skinny jeans to be elegant.
    Pair them with ballet flats, a plaid button up shirt and a cardigan.
    whatever works for you.

## Warnings

-   People may stereotype you as stuck up because of the way you dress.

    that matters!
