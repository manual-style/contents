The quote by Yves Saint Laurent “Fashions fade, style is eternal.” is
something you should live by. Style is eternal and being elegant is a
lot about style.

## Steps

1.  Know what true elegance is. Being elegant and dressing nicely is not
    about money. It stopped being about money long time ago. Fast
    fashion and amazing clothes are available to
    everyone.![](Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
2.  Go out and browse the
    stores.![](Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
3.  Be picky and sometimes brutal when choosing clothes. Especially if
    you want to look
    elegant.![](Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
4.  Get style basics which you can mix and match! E.g. White/black
    shirt, t-shirt, well fitting jacket, jeans, bag and nice
    shoes.![](Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
5.  Always remember it is worth paying more once, than getting one cheap
    item that you will throw away after a week. (Think long
    term).![](Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Mix and match. White t-shirt, jeans, pearl necklace, decent bag and
    shoes make a great combo for day. In the evening you can wear the
    same jeans but pair it up with a shirt. It is really easy to look
    good.![](Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
7.  Accessorize! Accessories do make a difference. Buy a strand of fake
    pearls and you will always look
    chic!![](Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Remember you will always look good as long as you have a pretty
    smile and
    confidence!![](Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Elegant_when_Poor_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
