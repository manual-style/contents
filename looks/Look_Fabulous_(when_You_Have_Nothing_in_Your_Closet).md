Look [fabulous](Be_Ghetto_Fabulous "wikilink") when your closet has
nothing for that special occasion--that hideous sweater that you got for
the holidays might even just work with the right plan.

## Steps

1.  Give your hair Flair! People will be impressed with a gorgeous hair
    style. Try different styles instead of a normal style that you do
    everyday. Go with barrel curls, or instead of that ponytail, let
    your hair just sway in the wind. Maybe some glitter or a fancy
    up-do?![](Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Focus on Make-Up. A beautiful made up face will draw attention to
    *you*. For special occasions, you can go much more dramatic with
    make-up than usual...so take advantage of
    that.![](Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Do up your nails! Make sure that you give yourself a manicure and
    pedicure! You can do this cheaply and by yourself very easily. If
    you decide not to wear lipstick or makeup, try a color that goes
    along with your skin color the best. A new color will have everyone
    saying that they love your nails instead of talking about what
    you're wearing. You can never go wrong with a French
    manicure.![](Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_3.jpg")
4.  [Accessories](Buy_Accessories_for_an_Outfit "wikilink") can
    dramatically change an
    outfit.![](Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_4.jpg")
    -   A versatile
        [accessory](Choose_Unique_Handbags_and_Purses "wikilink") to use
        is a clutch. Clutches are multi-taskers; they can be used for
        special occasions, and they can also be used for a night out or
        a day at work/school.
    -   Jewelry is another accessory that is a life-saver. A nice
        [necklace](Make_a_Hemp_Necklace "wikilink") and a dramatic pair
        of earrings can do the trick if put with the right outfit. Rings
        can add any twist to an outfit that you are wearing.
    -   Scarves, belts, and headbands are also great accessories.
    -   Focus on one or two great, dramatic pieces. Wearing too many at
        once will make you look over-done, tacky, and cluttered.
5.  Shoes --the right pair can make a difference in an ensemble. How
    about cowboy boots with you blue jeans? Red flats with your
    otherwise boring T-shirt and
    leggings?![](Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_5.jpg "fig:Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Make or alter your clothes. If you have the expertise, or access to
    a handy and creative person, and some time, you may be able to make
    something unique and fabulous out of your same old stuff. Even
    simply using fabric glue with some sparkly embellishments, or
    ironing on funky patches on your ripped cargo pants, or tie-dying a
    boring tee shirt can enliven an outfit. Hey, fashion designers often
    start this way! Some other
    examples:![](Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_6.jpg "fig:Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_6.jpg")
    -   Put some rhinestones on a boring black shirt.
    -   Add some dramatic trim to your jean skirt.
    -   Take the length up on the hem and cut off the poofy sleeves your
        cousin's old prom dress.
    -   Bleach out that concert tee for the dance. Make your own funky
        pants out of that length of denim.
7.  Have confidence and a positive attitude! "You're never fully dressed
    without a smile" goes the song from the play and movie *Annie*. And
    it's true. Looking fabulous is, in large part, recognizing your own
    fabulous-ness. And, anyway, the nice part about having nothing great
    to wear is never over-dressing! Think simple, classy, and creative
    rather than pout, "I have nothing to
    wear!"![](Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_7.jpg "fig:Look_Fabulous_(when_You_Have_Nothing_in_Your_Closet)_Step_7.jpg")

## Tips

-   Have good basics in your wardrobe: a "little black dress", nice
    chino pants and rad shirt, the shirt that makes you look 10 pounds
    thinner, whatever works. You can dress up and down.
-   When accessorizing a basic but boring outfit, in general, sparkles,
    shine, metallics, and color will make a huge difference.
-   Make sure the color [nail
    polish](Experiment_With_Nail_Polish_Colors "wikilink") you chose
    matches your skin tone, other than red, people with pale skin should
    go with light colored nail polish.
-   Keep your audience in mind. Boys, in general, will not generally
    even *notice* your shoes, but will notice a dramatic hairdo or
    gorgeously made up eyes.
-   Also don't forget to curl your lashes before applying
    [mascara](Apply_Mascara "wikilink").

## Warnings

-   Don't over-accessorize. Too much is just too much.
-   Unless you're really, really crafty and an excellent sewer, do *not*
    attempt last-minute alterations.
-   Tanning may improve skin-tone, but is dangerous to your skin. A
    self-tanner is a safer choice.
