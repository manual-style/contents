## Steps

1.  Think of something that will make you a trendsetter and stand out
    from the crowd. Look in magazines for different styles. Some
    examples are bohemian, hippie, trendy, sporty chick, country girl,
    punk rocker, emo or you can create your own. Mix and match different
    outfits until you find your unique
    style.![](Look_Glamorous_and_Chic_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Glamorous_and_Chic_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Change your hair. Some ideas- blonde and auburn highlights, curling,
    straighten. To get blonde highlights, get a cup of lemon juice and
    work it into your hair. Go out into the sun for 2 hours then wash
    your hair and
    dry.![](Look_Glamorous_and_Chic_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Glamorous_and_Chic_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Make a facial. Mash up some avocado and spread it over your face.
    Wash it off in 15 minutes to feel refreshed. You can also cut a fig
    in half and place a half on each eye. You can also use cucumber,
    cotton pads soaked in aloe vera water and more. you can also do a
    rejuvenating turmeric FACIAL. Be
    creative.![](Look_Glamorous_and_Chic_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Glamorous_and_Chic_Step_3.jpg")

    a must for hippies as they can surprisingly have some good stuff to
    try out. Also, raid your parents cupboards for some retro, funky
    items including bright tees, buckle boots, patterned scarves. You'll
    be amazed at all the different outfits you can
