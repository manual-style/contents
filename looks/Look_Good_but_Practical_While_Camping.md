When camping you walk the fine line between fashion and practicality.
Pack these products to ensure you don't end up looking and feeling grimy
and disgruntled during your next camping adventure. The key is to keep
makeup light, natural and quick to apply. Hair can be kept manageable &
clean and a few essential clothing items will give you that flair. Pack
these few essentials to streamline your morning routine to camping
perfection.

## Steps

1.  Use a BB cream: A BB cream will offer more coverage then a tinted
    moisturizer as well as keeping your skin blemish-free and
    moisturized. BB creams contain SPF which will protect your skin from
    the sun's
    rays.![](Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Tint your lips with a tinted lip
    balm.![](Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_2.jpg")
    -   A red tinted lip balm is practical to keep your lips moisturized
        and offer a hint of colour.
    -   A red lip balm can also double as a blush, making it a logical
        and multi-use choice.
3.  Keep your eyelashes dry, while you keeping them colored with a
    waterproof mascara. Camping can come with unexpected plunges into
    lakes, heavy rain and heavy sweat! Keep your eye makeup from running
    by doing a quick application of waterproof
    mascara.![](Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Wash your face with a face wash product. Bring a light face wash to
    remove makeup, dirt and
    grime.![](Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Wash your hair with a dry shampoo: You never know whether your
    campsite will have showers or not, so be sure to pack along some dry
    shampoo. Dry shampoo will neutralize greasy hair in minutes as well
    as giving your hair volume and
    manageability.![](Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_5.jpg "fig:Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Use elastic bands in your hair. *A braid is a camper's best
    friend.*![](Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_6.jpg "fig:Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Wear plaid shirts. The plaid shirt is a must. It keeps you warm, the
    busy pattern hides stains and it can be easily layered with a
    neutral colored tank top(such as colored white or
    gray).![](Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_7.jpg "fig:Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Wear some athletic leggings. Athletic leggings will show off your
    body and will go nicely with nearly anything. And best of all, they
    are comfortable in every aspect of a normal camper's daily
    lifestyle.![](Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_8.jpg "fig:Look_Good_but_Practical_While_Camping_Step_8.jpg")
