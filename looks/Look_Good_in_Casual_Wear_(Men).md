Do you wake up in the morning, take a shower, and throw on whatever is
clean? If so, this article will help any man who questions his casual
self.

## Steps

1.  Know what the weather for the day is like! Common sense will tell
    you not to wear athletic shorts and a V-neck in the winter. Dressing
    according to the weather is priority
    one.![](Look_Good_in_Casual_Wear_(Men)_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Good_in_Casual_Wear_(Men)_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Once you have decided what will be best for the day, start with your
    shorts or
    jeans.![](Look_Good_in_Casual_Wear_(Men)_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Good_in_Casual_Wear_(Men)_Step_2.jpg")
3.  As a general rule, your standard pair of denim jeans goes with any
    color. Some prefer a light shirt or jacket to accompany the blue or
    black.![](Look_Good_in_Casual_Wear_(Men)_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Good_in_Casual_Wear_(Men)_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Shorts take a little more thinking. Cargo and khaki shorts tend to
    be more directed at uniform style and neutrality, while athletic
    shorts bring out the sporty, energetic side of oneself. Khakis
    always look sharp with a polo and white undershirt, and athletic
    shorts are meant for light T-shirts and solid
    colors.![](Look_Good_in_Casual_Wear_(Men)_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Good_in_Casual_Wear_(Men)_Step_4.jpg")
5.  If you decide on plaid shorts, don't wear any other pattern! Plaids
    are meant to compliment the color of your
    shirt.![](Look_Good_in_Casual_Wear_(Men)_Step_5.jpg "fig:Look_Good_in_Casual_Wear_(Men)_Step_5.jpg")
6.  As for shoes, keep it neutral! A rugged pair of black, white, or
    grey sneakers compliment any outfit. I tend to wear a pair of Nike
    Sweets or Adidas Superstars with my outfit, both being neutral
    colored and very
    durable.![](Look_Good_in_Casual_Wear_(Men)_Step_6.jpg "fig:Look_Good_in_Casual_Wear_(Men)_Step_6.jpg")

## Warnings
