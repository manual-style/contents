Many primary schools wear polo shirts, but high schools tend to wear a
shirt and tie. However, there are some high schools where you do have to
wear polo shirts. This guide will help you in looking either smart or
stylish, for all people.

## Steps

### Looking Smart in a School Polo Shirt.

1.  Look at the dress code for your school. Usually, in a high school
    where your school uniform makes you wear polo shirts, it is usually
    alongside v-neck jumpers and blazers, mostly with the v-neck jumpers
    being optional.
    -   Try to wear everything on the uniform list. Remember to wear the
        blazer over it and most of the time a jumper is optional, but
        wear one anyway; it looks smart. You don't need to wear a jumper
        if it's too hot, have in mind.
2.  Remember to do up the buttons. If you want to look smart, then this
    is what you should do. Nothing looks scruffier than having the
    buttons undone.
3.  Remember to tuck it into your trousers, skirt etc. This looks very
    smart. Despite it being covered up by the jumper, if you ever want
    to take it off, you'll still look smart.

### Looking Stylish in a School Polo Shirt

It's hard to look stylish since polos tend to look plain. However, there
are a few methods of looking stylish.

#\* Keep these two things in mind:

#\* Don't be afraid to undo the top button. Just don't undo all of them.

#\* Having it untucked does look stylish in certain circumstances. For
example, an untucked polo shirt looks nice with trousers, but it would
look nicer to tuck it in with a skirt.

1.  For the rest of the uniform, reflect on your personality. For
    example, you could think about this idea for your dress code.
    -   A rule breaker student would probably look good with an untucked
        shirt and no jumper,
    -   A nerdy student would probably look good with a tucked in shirt
        and a jumper.

## Tips

-   Don't be afraid to experiment with trial and error, you could look
    great!
-   If you have a mindset where you think polo shirts are very
    traditional, you may be tempted to cover it up. Don't be afraid to
    show it off, it only looks bad if you ruff it up too much.

## Warnings

-   Don't wear jumpers on very hot days, it can be damaging to your
    health.
