Be the girl everyone is staring at when you emerge from the ocean — and
not because your boobs have fallen out.

## Steps

1.  Buy a one-piece. Buy a one-piece bathing suit; it will stay in place
    better than a bikini. Or a full piece top and bikini
    bottom.![](Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
2.  Condition your hair. Comb generous amounts of leave-in conditioner
    through your hair. Look for one with
    sunscreen.![](Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
3.  Pick a hairstyle. Put your hair in a wave-proof style, like
    [cornrows](Braid_Cornrows "wikilink"), braids, or a high
    ponytail.![](Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
4.  Apply discreet makeup. Look like a natural beauty by applying tinted
    sunscreen, waterproof mascara (to curled eyelashes), and clear lip
    gloss or a lipstick that’s the exact shade of your lips. Tame brows
    with some
    Vaseline.![](Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
5.  Do the model walk when you emerge from the water. one leg in front
    of the other. Do not go over the
    top.![](Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
6.  have a smile on your face when your friend is with you. Don't smile
    for no reason, look at her and smile when she is talking to
    you.![](Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_6_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_6_Version_3.jpg")
7.  Pick up your towel. Pick up your towel without bending your knees.
    Flick the excess water from your hair as you gently pat yourself
    dry.![](Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_7_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_7_Version_3.jpg")
8.  Don oversized sunglasses. Wear dark, oversized sunglasses so you can
    discreetly check out the guys checking you
    out![](Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_8_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Hot_when_You_Get_out_of_the_Ocean_Step_8_Version_3.jpg")

## Tips

-   When your feet are still obscured in the water, walk on your tiptoes
    to make your legs look long and sleek.
-   Secure the back of your bathing suit with double-stick tape; there’s
    nothing sexy about picking your swimsuit out of your butt.
-   Unless you already have a gorgeous tan, slap on some bronzer.
