Have you ever wanted to be immortal? Well, now is your chance! Read this
article for an easy way on how to look immortal.

## Steps

1.  Read up on past eras. You should be able to share knowledge about
    the eras you existed in.
    -   Occasionally say things like, "This reminds me of the time
        \*historical figure\* and I...". Play it off as an accident by
        gasping or covering your mouth mid sentence.
2.  Wear fashion of past eras. You are going to need some old fashioned
    clothes or Victorian styled clothing or you can just use homemade
    cloth because back then they just (most of the time) made there own
    clothes. A white sheet would work for a ghostly look if you cut it
    up and add
    shreds.![](Look_Immortal_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Immortal_Step_1.jpg")
3.  Achieve the accent. So you want an English or British accent because
    long ago most accents were spoken that way. When saying your R's you
    want it to sound like your saying our with a slight sound of the O.
    Like for instance, if your saying rustic it will sound like your
    saying 'rawstic' .Your A's should be held out longer a bit so should
    your E's , Y's and U's. It will sound slightly ghostly. But that is
    kind of the point. So if you want a really ghostly sound make all
    your letters long slow and make them fade slightly at the
    end.![](Look_Immortal_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Immortal_Step_2.jpg")
4.  Use light foundation. Use a ivory shade of concealer then a light
    medium for some parts of your face such as your under eyes nose
    forehead and all the other spots were the sun hits your skin
    naturally. Then apply a velvety red lipstick gloss or balm onto your
    lips o make your face paler and lips will really pop. For your eyes
    you don't want a dramatic look for eyes but you can use a soft cocoa
    color on the lids and a cream color on the crease. For blush just
    use a very light coral NOT RED PINK OR PURPLE. It can be slightly
    pink but only a little pink works
    best.![](Look_Immortal_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Immortal_Step_3.jpg")
5.  Act mature. You will seem as if you were older because long ago the
    children were more mature than they are now and they would be
    punished more for doing things
    bad.![](Look_Immortal_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Immortal_Step_4.jpg")
