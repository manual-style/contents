## Steps

1.  France: Look oh-so-Parisian with black and white stripes-and make
    your outfit pop with splashes of red. A beret is a classic, and if
    you have instructions, you can crochet or knit it
    yourself!![](Look_Internationally_Chic_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Internationally_Chic_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Brazil: Let loose and go wild with neon colors-you'll reflect the
    fun atmosphere of Rio De Janeiro! For this, wear beads, sleeveless
    maxi dresses, and bandana-like headbands.
