3.  If you usually have your hair down, style it, and let it down. If
    you put it up because it's curly, take the extra time to straighten
    it. Or if it's the other way around,curl it
    up.![](Look_Perfect_for_a_Friday_(for_Girls)_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Perfect_for_a_Friday_(for_Girls)_Step_3.jpg")

    day about how you look to others. Just forget and have
