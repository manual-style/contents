Sometimes, girls can't be taken seriously. When it comes to applying to
a college or just at school, sometimes, looks can help a lot.

## Steps

1.  Normally, having good looks and not dressing trashy is good for
    being treated like a normal person. When you have a nice looking
    exspensive \[ It really doesn't have to be exspensive you can get
    then at Target\] necklace, it can really step up your confidence and
    how people treat you.
2.  Also, have a nice blouse. Something that really fits you correctly
    and shows your personallty. Not something like a sweatshirt.
3.  Shoes also. When coming to shoes, try something like flats. Those
    are not painfull high heels but not smelly sneakers.
4.  Lastly, pants. Don't wear baggy pants or super tight leggings. Maybe
    a skinny jean can work with your outfit. Or, if it's summer, a knee
    leangth skirt.

## Tips

-   \- When putting together a outfit, don't try to be someone
    else.-Adding a little bit of makeup can help, not a truckload.-Plan
    your outfit the night before your big day, so you won't go crazy in
    the morning.-Perfume is also a nice touch, but only one spray, you
    don't want people to be coughing when they see you.
