## Steps

### Think like a shabby chic girl

    apologies. Act like the innocent old
    lady.![](Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Be a bookworm. Be well read. You want to look like the girl who is
    smart that reads
    books.![](Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Be the shy girl in the class. Let other people make the first move
    then open
    up.![](Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Act cute. Blush a little, twirl your hair with your finger, and
    giggle.![](Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")

### Look like a shabby chic girl

1.  Be pale. Shabby chic girls might go out and do stuff outside all the
    time but that doesn't mean being tan is good. Also, if you have
    freckles flaunt
    them!![](Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Have natural hair colors. You can can have all types of hair colors
    but NO unnatural. If a shabby chic girl does want some unnatural
    colors she will die her tips but no loud colors soft/pale/baby
    colors.![](Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Take care of your skin. Complexion is important. No blemishes and no
    blackheads as much as possible. A shabby chic girl wants to look
    natural but not that
    natural.![](Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")

### Dress like a shabby chic girl

1.  Vintage clothing is what shabby chic it all about. Some worn down
    clothes but that doesn't make you look like a hobo.Anything with
    roses in the design is
    perfect.![](Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Pure white as well as worn or bleached out pastel colors are perfect
    for shabby chic clothes. Clothes that are often stained with tea to
    give the look of old fabric are so shabby chic. Bleached and faded
    are terms often applied to the
    style.![](Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Vintage floral patterns with pastel colours, cotton ticking
    patterns, or linen in earth tones, are all typical of shabby chic
    style.![](Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Accessorize. Flowers. flower rings, flower necklaces, flower
    bracelets, even flowers in your hair! Don't do all at once though
    you want to look
    simple.![](Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Bows. Bows are perfect in your hair or on any
    accessory.![](Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Shabby_Chic_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")

    vintage places. Also you can be friends with kawaii/lolita girls to
    help you with your personality and be cute.
-   Laced stockings with a floral skirt and a rose pink little sweater
    tucked in is a great choice to start off with to get a feel of what
    its like to dress shabby chic.

## Warnings

-   You might be called a hipster but don't listen to those who call you
    a hipster.
