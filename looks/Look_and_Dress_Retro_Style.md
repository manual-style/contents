Want to know how to dress chic but in the olden days style? Then this
article is perfect for you!

## Steps

1.  Go shopping! Throw out any old clothes that you don't need to make
    space for new ones. Check with your parents or grandparents to see
    if they've kept some of their old clothes. The latest style is retro
    so most shops will sell retro stuff. Go for waistcoats, tunic tops,
    jeans (any style), smock tops, mini-skirts, swing cardigans, floaty,
    full skirts, pumps and chunky
    jewelry.![](Look_and_Dress_Retro_Style_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_and_Dress_Retro_Style_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Crop trousers look great with a pair of black pumps!
2.  Go for bright colours in blue, green, pink, lilac and
    orange.![](Look_and_Dress_Retro_Style_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_and_Dress_Retro_Style_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
3.  Wear pinafores and tunics over tight fitting black or blue jeans
    (Preferably with a bootleg or flare or even skinny fit) or leggings.
    Or go for patterned
    leggings!![](Look_and_Dress_Retro_Style_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_and_Dress_Retro_Style_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
4.  Be wild. Wear a fitted black waistcoat over a colourful tunic to
    give it that extra
    edge.![](Look_and_Dress_Retro_Style_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_and_Dress_Retro_Style_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
5.  To be 'retro', you don't need a certain hairstyle or cut, but longer
    hair does compliment it well. Keep your hair tied back with a head
    scarf or ribbon but leave it down and
    natural.![](Look_and_Dress_Retro_Style_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_and_Dress_Retro_Style_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
6.  For make-up, put a thin line of eyeliner on your bottom lid and
    sweep a light eyeshadow on the lower part of your top lid. Add a bit
    of gloss or Vaseline to your lips and you're
    done!![](Look_and_Dress_Retro_Style_Step_6_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_and_Dress_Retro_Style_Step_6_Version_3.jpg")
