Vintage clothing is a unique style with a lot of individuality, but
buying vintage clothing can be very expensive. However you can get an
idea by looking at a vintage item and then re-create the design yourself
for 1/2 the cost. Go to step one for more details.

## Steps

1.  Find or buy a plain shirt, t-shirt, dress, skirt, or trousers to use
    as your canvas.
2.  Buy dye paints suited for your material, check the tags for
    information about the tool.
3.  Work from a mood board, sketch, drawing or photograph.
    -   Feel free to create by letting your ideas flow on a sketch pad
        or mood board and use that as your base. Brainstorm and research
        on designs you feel are right.
4.  Make and re-create the color and style you want using the dye,
    beads, belts straps etc.
    -   Recycle items you have in your household. Get funky with it!
    -   Take your time and don't rush your creation.

## Tips

    curtains, carpets, cushions, rugs, light fixtures, bedding, sofas,
    and other household furniture.
