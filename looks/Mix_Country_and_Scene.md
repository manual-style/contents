Ever wanted to look scene but also country? If you answered yes, than
this is the article for you. WARNING: This is not the article to BE
country, just to get the look.

## Steps

1.  Get the wardrobe. Don't throw away anything yet, just find new items
    to bring a stronger look of the combination. Buy clothing such as
    checkered/plaid shirts and short shorts in contrasting colors such
    as
    orange.![](Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_1.jpg "fig:Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Organize your wardrobe. Separate all the clothes you can't wear, the
    clothes you don't want but can wear, and the clothes you can wear.
    Give away or recycle clothing you can't wear and box up and store
    the clothes you don't want but still can wear, just in case you
    change your mind. If you really don't want those old clothes than
    give them away or recycle them
    too.![](Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_2.jpg "fig:Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Get the hair. Try a style such as parting your hair in a horizontal
    line and put low pigtails on the lower half and making the top half
    in a bob-like style. An example of this type style is when Wenwen
    Han first appeared in the movie Karate
    Kid.![](Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_3.jpg "fig:Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Accessorize. Buy some glasses(they make many just for show, not for
    improving eyesight) that are thick
    rimmed.![](Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_4.jpg "fig:Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Buy hoop
    earrings.![](Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_5.jpg "fig:Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Get the accent. To add a more realistic appearance get a country
    accent or fake it. Also be tough it's a nice touch to have a tough,
    colorful, and country
    gal.![](Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_6.jpg "fig:Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Develop a great smile. Don't frown. Smile even if your smile isn't
    perfect.![](Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_7.jpg "fig:Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_7.jpg")

    reputation for this
    style.![](Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_8.jpg "fig:Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_8.jpg")

    in those short
    shorts!![](Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_9.jpg "fig:Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_9.jpg")
10. Wear the right cosmetics. Wear blush, nail polish, eyeliner,
    eyeshadow, and so
    on.![](Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_10.jpg "fig:Mix_Country_and_Scene_Step_10.jpg")
