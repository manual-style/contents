It's really great to look dressed up during the weekdays but what about
weekends and those times when you head out for a vacation or spend a
weekend relaxing amid company? Then you are in need of a relaxed
wardrobe look.

## Steps

1.  Choose colors that are relaxed. Look for colors that suit you well
    but that fall within the relaxed range. Relaxed colors include
    beige, pastels, silver, deep blues and purples, greens and colors of
    the
    forest.![](Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_1.jpg "fig:Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Choose fabrics that are comfortable and yet sit well on your body.
    Silks, linen, tencel, cottons, wool and breathable fabrics are
    usually good clothes for relaxing in. Look for a nice flow and if
    you want comfort, elasticized waists or good
    fits.![](Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_2.jpg "fig:Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Go for t-shirts for the first layer. A fresh white t-shirt goes well
    with most color combinations. It's a good idea to own a few white
    t-shirts, so that you can stay relaxed and not spend all your time
    washing!![](Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_3.jpg "fig:Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_3.jpg")
    -   Other nice tops include baby doll, long flowing tops and
        transparent tops over a t-shirt or camisole.
4.  Choose loose but stylish jeans. Tencel is an excellent fabric for
    comfort and neat style. Alternatively, choose white, beige or brown
    slacks in such fabrics as linen, Tencel or silk. Elasticized waists
    can be disguised with belts, scarves or over-length
    tops.![](Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_4.jpg "fig:Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_4.jpg")
    -   If you don't want to wear pants, choose long flowing skirts or
        dresses. Ones that feel luxurious and billow around your legs
        are lovely for relaxing.
5.  If you'd prefer a dress, instead choose a longer style with flow and
    a romantic
    touch.![](Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_5.jpg "fig:Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Find a comfortable fitted cardigan or sweater. Choose a contrasting
    color from the
    t-shirt.![](Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_6.jpg "fig:Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Wear flat shoes. These are very relaxed and are easy to kick off for
    lazing around. Ballet flats are a common favorite for a chic relaxed
    look but other flats like sandals, sneakers, loafers, espadrilles or
    other styles of flats can work
    too.![](Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_7.jpg "fig:Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Choose jewelry that matches your clothing. Don't overdo it; choose
    pieces that aren't too complicated. A simple silver bangle, a plain
    gold necklace, diamante drop earrings, etc. are good relaxed
    additions.![](Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_8.jpg "fig:Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Keep your hair relaxed in style. No tight, pulled back styles. Wear
    hair either down or loosely added to a messy bun or ponytail; or try
    scrunching your hair for a day of pretty hair that says
    relaxed.![](Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_9.jpg "fig:Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_9.jpg")
10. Add other items if you like
    them.![](Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_10.jpg "fig:Put_Together_a_Relaxed_Wardrobe_Step_10.jpg")
    -   If you're adding a hat, make sure it's in keeping with the other
        items. Don't wear hats that are too fancy; a simple straw hat or
        a beanie are relaxed choices.
    -   Scarves, especially flowing silk or similar ones create a
        relaxed and comfortable look.
    -   Sunglasses are good for keeping relaxed during bright days
        instead of squinting.

## Tips

-   During warmer months, three quarter pants (capris) are good too.
    Leggings work well for cooler weather.
-   Keep makeup simple and light.
-   If you'd rather wear a jacket, choose a loose but neat one in
    relaxed colors. It's okay to wear the jacket open. You should be
    able to move freely in it; nothing too fitted. Denim or tencel
    jackets are good.
-   Flip flops are acceptable footwear if you're comfortable in them and
    they match the clothes well.
