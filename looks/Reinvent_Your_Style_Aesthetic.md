Reinventing your style aesthetic is fun to do, and often necessary to
reflect how you’ve grown and changed as a person. You might find
yourself bored with your old look, or you might simply feel like your
look could use a bit of an update. Whatever style you’re going for,
start by weeding out and adding new pieces to your wardrobe. Then, try
enhancing your new look with a subtle or dramatic new hairstyle. Finish
off your new look with extra details, such as a new makeup look (if you
wear makeup) or a manicure.

## Steps

### Reinventing Your Wardrobe

1.  Sort the items in your closet and donate or [sell what you no longer
    wear](Sell-Vintage-Clothing "wikilink"). Taking a thorough inventory
    of what you have in your closet can help you to identify items that
    are part of your old style aesthetic. By sorting through everything
    you have, you can pare down your wardrobe to items that suit your
    new desired style
    aesthetic.[1]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_1.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_1.jpg")
    -   Try dumping out everything in your closet onto your bed or the
        floor so that you can look at each item 1 by 1. If it’s
        something you like and want to keep, hang it back in your
        closet. If it’s something you no longer enjoy wearing, put it
        into your donate or sell pile.[2]
2.  Follow your fashion icons on social media for style inspiration. If
    you’re trying to figure out what you want your new look to be, try
    following style icons on social media, such as on Instagram or
    Twitter. See what they’re wearing and if you spot something you
    like, see if they’ve shared the link for where they got
    it.[3]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_2.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_2.jpg")
    -   If something is out of your price range, look for a similar item
        in a thrift shop or discount shopping website.
    -   You can also look at magazines and Pinterest for inspiration.
        Try saving images of the items that you want to incorporate into
        your new style aesthetic.
3.  Identify new outfits that reflect your desired style aesthetic. Once
    you’ve acquired some new items that reflect your new look, start
    incorporating them into your wardrobe. Mix and match the pieces to
    create the look you want. When formulating your signature style,
    decide whether you want to completely change it up, or expand on
    your current
    wardrobe.[4]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_3.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_3.jpg")
    -   For example, maybe you already have the classy aesthetic you
        want, but you just want to fine tune it and make it completely
        yours. Or maybe you’ve been [dressing
        preppy](Look_Preppy "wikilink") all your life and you want to
        turn it around entirely and go for a more
        [vintage](Dress_Vintage "wikilink"), [retro
        look](Dress_Retro_and_Unique "wikilink").
4.  Splurge on a new handbag or pair of shoes for an easy style update.
    If you can’t afford to buy new clothing right now, or if you’re just
    looking for another way to change up your style aesthetic, get a new
    handbag or pair of shoes. These items are often more noticeable than
    other items, so simply switching one or both of these can create a
    noticeable change in your style
    aesthetic.[5]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_4.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_4.jpg")
    -   For example, you could switch from a simple black handbag to an
        attention getting red handbag, or switch from a pair of beige
        ballet flats to a pair of black combat boots.
    -   Make sure to consider the look you’re going for and what item or
        items would be most effective for creating that look.
5.  Get a new jacket that you can wear with multiple outfits. A jacket
    is a great investment since you can wear it with lots of different
    outfits. Opt for a jacket that reflects the new style aesthetic
    you’re going for and make sure that it’s something you’ll love
    wearing![6]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_5.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_5.jpg")
    -   For example, you might opt for a black leather jacket if you're
        going for an edgy, biker look. Or, you might opt for a stylish
        blazer if you want to look polished and professional.
    -   Also, make sure to consider the climate where you live. If you
        live in a cold climate, you might opt for a warm jacket that you
        can layer as needed and wear from fall through spring.
    -   If you’re in a warm climate, you might opt for a lightweight
        jacket that you can wear over a tank top or t-shirt or layer up
        with long-sleeved shirts and sweaters in cooler weather.
6.  Select a few new pieces of jewelry or another accessory. Jewelry
    adds instant details to your look and it can change the whole mood
    of an outfit. Select a few new pieces of jewelry to emphasize your
    new style aesthetic, and wear them with your new outfits or use them
    to change up your current wardrobe. If you’re not big on jewelry,
    then you might go with a new watch, a tie, a hat, or a scarf to
    reflect your new style
    aesthetic.[7]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_6.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_6.jpg")
    -   For example, if you’re going for a classic, retro look, you
        might get a pair of pearl earrings. Or, if you’re going for an
        edgier look, you might opt for a choker necklace or a studded
        bracelet.

### Changing Your Hair

1.  Change the way you part your hair. It might seem insignificant, but
    changing the position of your part can have a dramatic effect on
    your look. If you wear your hair parted down the middle, try parting
    it to the right or left instead. If you wear your hair parted off to
    one side, try parting it down the
    middle.[8]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_7.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_7.jpg")
    -   Parting your hair down the middle will frame your face, while
        parting it to the side will accentuate 1 side of your face over
        the other and bring out different features.
2.  Style your hair in an [up-do for a short haircut
    look](Make-Your-Hair-Look-Short "wikilink"). If you’ve got long hair
    and you’re considering cutting your hair short, try doing a tucked
    up-do to simulate a short haircut. This can give you a whole new
    look without actually cutting your hair. This is a great option if
    you don’t want to commit to a short haircut or if you want to see
    how it might look on you
    first.[9]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_8.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_8.jpg")
    -   Use bobby pins to secure your hair under in the back.
3.  Try bangs or pin your bangs back. If you don’t have bangs, try
    asking for them at your next hair appointment. If you do have bangs,
    try pinning them back to make it look like you don’t have bangs.
    Either way, you’ll be changing your look in a noticeable
    way![10]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_9.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Use some hair gel and a few bobby pins to pin your bangs back
        out of your face if you want to try faking a non-bangs look.
4.  Smooth out your hair or make it curly. If you’ve got curly, wavy, or
    textured hair, [using a flat iron to smooth it
    out](Straighten-Your-Hair-With-a-Flat-Iron "wikilink") can
    dramatically change your look. Likewise, if your hair is straight,
    [curling your hair](Make-Naturally-Straight-Hair-Curly "wikilink")
    can make you look totally different. Try doing the opposite of
    whatever you have right
    now.[11]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_10.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_10.jpg")
5.  Get a new haircut to refresh your look. A haircut may be one of the
    easiest ways to reinvent yourself. For a small change, you can get a
    trim and slightly different style, such as layers. Or, you can do
    something dramatic, such as going from long hair to a bob or pixie
    cut. Consider what you’d like to try as your next hairstyle and save
    pictures of haircuts you
    like.[12]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_11.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_11.jpg")
    -   Try checking out images of haircuts you like online. Then, save
        the images to your phone so you can show them to your hair
        stylist.
6.  Color your hair for a more dramatic change. Coloring your hair is
    often even more dramatic than a haircut since it can bring out your
    eyes, make your skin tone appear different, and contribute to your
    style aesthetic, such as by making you look more conservative or
    edgy. Look at images of colors that you like and opt for something
    that appeals to
    you.[13]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_12.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Keep in mind that getting your hair colored at a salon can be
        expensive, but this will definitely give you a whole new look.
        If you prefer, you can try [coloring your own hair at
        home](Dye-Your-Hair-at-Home "wikilink") for a less expensive
        alternative.

### Trying a New Makeup Look

1.  Create drama with a bold eye makeup look. If you typically wear
    minimal eye makeup or you’ve been stuck in the same rut for a while,
    try something totally new to you. Opt for [black
    eyeliner](Apply-Eyeliner "wikilink") if you don’t usually wear it,
    or try a shade of eye shadow that you’ve never worn
    before.[14]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_13.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_13.jpg")
    -   For example, if you normally wear the same copper eye shadow
        most days, try wearing a shade of green eye shadow instead. Or,
        if you always wear black eyeliner, switch to a blue or brown
        eyeliner.
2.  Emphasize your eyebrows with an [eyebrow
    pencil](Use-Eyebrow-Pencil "wikilink"). Making your eyebrows look
    well-groomed can help to enhance your eyes further. Try filling in
    sparse areas of your eyebrows with an eyebrow pencil that matches
    the natural color of your brows. This will help enhance your eyes
    and change your
    look.[15]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_14.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_14.jpg")
    -   You don’t need to use a lot of eyebrow liner. A small amount
        will enhance your brows enough to be noticeable.
3.  [Wear red lipstick](Wear_Red_Lipstick "wikilink") for a bright,
    flattering touch. Red lipstick is flattering on just about everyone,
    but some people avoid it because it’s such a bold look. If red
    lipstick isn’t something you’d normally wear, choose a shade that
    you like and give it a
    try.[16]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_15.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_15.jpg")
    -   If red is too bold for your liking, try going with a coral or
        fuchsia pink shade for another way to add bright, bold color to
        your lips.
4.  Get a manicure to complete your new style aesthetic. Topping off
    your new look with a fresh set of nails is a great way to complete
    it. Depending on what you’re going for, you can get your nails done
    in a bright, bold shade, something neutral and demure, or simply get
    them cleaned, trimmed, and filed for a fresh well-groomed
    look.[17]![](Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_16.jpg "fig:Reinvent_Your_Style_Aesthetic_Step_16.jpg")
    -   Try getting your nails filed into a different shape than you
        normally would. For example, if you usually opt for
        almond-shaped nails, try squoval-shaped nails instead.
