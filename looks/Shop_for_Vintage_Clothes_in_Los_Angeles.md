        area in Burbank.

## Tips

-   Access to a car is extremely helpful in learning how to shop for
    vintage clothes in Los Angeles. Your search may take you to many
    far-flung areas, so gas up the car and check the tires before you
    start exploring for vintage finds.
-   Negotiate. Many stores will be willing negotiate on the price of a
    piece in order to make a sale. Be sure to ask if the price is
    flexible before paying full retail.
-   As you learn more about how to shop for vintage clothes in Los
    Angeles shopping areas, your definition may broaden beyond classic
    (more expensive) vintage clothing stores to include a range of
    thrift stores (Goodwill, Out of the Closet), upscale consignment
    stores, and movie costume shops (Western Costume). Weekend swap
    meets (The Rose Bowl in Pasadena) and yard sales also offer possible
    finds for shoppers with a keen eye for style.

## Warnings

-   Examine your vintage finds carefully before purchasing. Some items
    that may seem like an incredible deal when found in a thrift stores
    may be not salvageable if they are damaged. Furs that are torn are
    very difficult to repair. The cost of fixing furs or woven material
    is usually cost prohibitive.
