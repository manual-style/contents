![](Anne_Gwynne.jpg "fig:Anne_Gwynne.jpg"), 1943\]\] The term "**sweater
girl**" was made popular in the 1940s and 1950s to describe
[Hollywood](Hollywood "wikilink") [actresses](actresses "wikilink") like
[Lana Turner](Lana_Turner "wikilink"), [Jayne
Mansfield](Jayne_Mansfield "wikilink"), and [Jane
Russell](Jane_Russell "wikilink"), who adopted the popular fashion of
wearing tight, form-fitting [sweaters](sweater "wikilink") that
emphasized the woman's [bustline](bustline "wikilink").[1][2]

The sweater girl trend was not confined to Hollywood and was viewed with
alarm by some. In 1949 a [Pittsburgh
police](Pittsburgh_police "wikilink") superintendent even singled out
the sweater girl as a symptom of the moral decline of postwar youth:

## Fashion influence

![](Patti_Page_1955.JPG "fig:Patti_Page_1955.JPG"), 1955.\]\] New, soft
fabrics like [cashmere](cashmere_wool "wikilink") and
[angora](angora_wool "wikilink") were being used to make sweaters. The
conical shape bra, sometimes called a [bullet
bra](bullet_bra "wikilink"), raises and separates her breasts. In its
original form, the look was often tied to the promotion of new
[bra](brassiere "wikilink") technology.

Interest in the bullet bra revived after
[Madonna](Madonna_(entertainer) "wikilink") wore a cone bra during her
1990 [Blond Ambition World
Tour](Blond_Ambition_World_Tour "wikilink").[3] The bra was designed by
[Jean Paul Gaultier](Jean_Paul_Gaultier "wikilink") who was inspired by
the vintage Perma-Lift bullet bra of the 1940s. By that time, the style
was regarded as erotic and provocative. The bullet bra has also become
popular with [burlesque](burlesque "wikilink") and
[rockabilly](rockabilly "wikilink") enthusiasts, both of which draw
inspiration from the 1950s.

## Popular culture

[Lana Turner](Lana_Turner "wikilink")'s appearance in the 1937 film
*[They Won't Forget](They_Won't_Forget "wikilink")* in a tight-fitting
knit top is sometimes considered the first case of the "sweater girl",
as Hollywood publicists sought for a catchy phrase to describe the
impact she made on the screen. Movie magazines nicknamed her "The
Sweater Girl," just as [Ann Sheridan](Ann_Sheridan "wikilink") was "The
Oomph Girl," [Dorothy Lamour](Dorothy_Lamour "wikilink") "The Sarong
Girl," and [Clara Bow](Clara_Bow "wikilink") "The [It
Girl](It_girl "wikilink")."

*[Sweater Girl](Sweater_Girl_(film) "wikilink")* is the name of a 1942
film written by [Robert Blees](Robert_Blees "wikilink") and [Beulah
Marie Dix](Beulah_Marie_Dix "wikilink"), directed by [William
Clemens](William_Clemens_(film_director) "wikilink") and starring [Eddie
Bracken](Eddie_Bracken "wikilink"), [June
Preisser](June_Preisser "wikilink"), [Phillip
Terry](Phillip_Terry "wikilink"), and [Betty Jane
Rhodes](Betty_Jane_Rhodes "wikilink").[4]

From the 1944 *[Army–Navy Screen
Magazine](Army–Navy_Screen_Magazine "wikilink")* #20, a one-reel short
that showed portions of a special *[Armed Forces Radio
Network](Armed_Forces_Radio_Network "wikilink")* recording session, [Bob
Hope](Bob_Hope "wikilink") introduces "sweater girl" [Judy
Garland](Judy_Garland "wikilink"). Before she sings *[Over the
Rainbow](Over_the_Rainbow "wikilink")*, they perform a short comic
sketch, Judy asking why men are so crazy about sweater girls. Bob says
he doesn't know and wisecracks, "That's one mystery I'd like to
unravel".[5]

In September 1968 an obscure clerical worker named [Francine
Gottfried](Francine_Gottfried "wikilink") briefly attained international
celebrity as "Wall Street's Sweater Girl" as large crowds of gawking men
and newspaper reporters awaited her arrival at the [Wall
Street](Wall_Street "wikilink") subway stop each morning and mobbed her
on her way to work.[6]
