**Casual Friday** (also known as **dress-down Friday** or **casual
day**) is a [Western dress code](/Western_dress_code "wikilink") trend
since late 20th century, in which some business offices relax their
[dress code](/Social_aspects_of_clothing#Private_dress_codes "wikilink")
on Fridays. It has since spread to other parts of the world. Some
businesses that usually require employees to wear [lounge
suits](/Suit_(clothing) "wikilink"), [dress
shirts](/dress_shirt "wikilink"), [neckties](/necktie "wikilink"), and
[dress shoes](/dress_shoe "wikilink"), may allow more casual wear on
Fridays.

Casual Friday had its origin from [Hawaii](/Hawaii "wikilink")'s custom
of [Aloha Friday](/Aloha_Friday "wikilink") which slowly spread east to
[California](/California "wikilink"), continuing around the globe until
the 1990s when it became known as Casual Friday. Today, in Hawaii Aloha
Wear is worn as business attire for any day of the week, and Aloha
Friday is generally used to refer to the last day of the work week.
