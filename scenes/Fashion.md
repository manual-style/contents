**Fashion** is a popular aesthetic expression in a certain time and
context, especially in clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories,
makeup, hairstyle and body proportions. Whereas, a trend often connotes
a very specific aesthetic expression, and often lasting shorter than a
season, fashion is a distinctive and industry-supported expression
traditionally tied to the fashion season and collections. Style is an
expression that lasts over many seasons, and is often connected to
cultural movements and social markers, symbols, class and culture (ex.
Baroque, Rococo, etc.). According to sociologist Pierre Bourdieu,
fashion connotes “the latest fashion, the latest difference.”

Even though they are often used together, the term fashion differs from
clothes and costume, where the first describes the material and
technical garment, whereas the second has been relegated to special
senses like fancy-dress or masquerade wear. Fashion instead describes
the social and temporal system that "activates" dress as a social
signifier in a certain time and context.
