A **scene** is the environment in which clothes are worn by people and
the fashion system operates. A scene may be a geographical region, a
seasonal or meteorological condition, an
[occasion](/Occasions "wikilink") or an
[occupation](/Occupations "wikilink") where a specific dress code is
enforced, or a [fictional](/Fictions "wikilink") setting in which
clothes are presented as costumes.
