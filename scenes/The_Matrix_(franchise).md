***The Matrix*** is an American [media
franchise](media_franchise "wikilink") created by [the
Wachowskis](the_Wachowskis "wikilink"). The series primarily consists of
a trilogy of [science fiction action
films](science_fiction_action_film "wikilink") beginning with *[The
Matrix](The_Matrix "wikilink")* (1999) and continuing with two sequels,
*[The Matrix Reloaded](The_Matrix_Reloaded "wikilink")* and *[The Matrix
Revolutions](The_Matrix_Revolutions "wikilink")* (both in 2003), all
written and directed by the Wachowskis and produced by [Joel
Silver](Joel_Silver "wikilink"). The franchise is owned by [Warner
Bros.](Warner_Bros. "wikilink"), which distributed the films along with
[Village Roadshow Pictures](Village_Roadshow_Pictures "wikilink"). The
latter, along with [Silver Pictures](Silver_Pictures "wikilink") are the
two production companies that worked on all three films.

The series features a [cyberpunk](cyberpunk "wikilink") story of the
technological fall of man, in which the creation of [artificial
intelligence](artificial_intelligence "wikilink") led way to a race of
self-aware machines that imprisoned mankind in a [virtual
reality](virtual_reality "wikilink") system—the Matrix—to be farmed as a
power source. Every now and then, some of the prisoners manage to break
free from the system and, considered a threat, become pursued by the
artificial intelligence both inside and outside of it. The films focus
on the plight of [Neo](Neo_(The_Matrix) "wikilink") (played by [Keanu
Reeves](Keanu_Reeves "wikilink")),
[Trinity](Trinity_(The_Matrix) "wikilink") ([Carrie-Anne
Moss](Carrie-Anne_Moss "wikilink")) and
[Morpheus](Morpheus_(The_Matrix) "wikilink") ([Laurence
Fishburne](Laurence_Fishburne "wikilink")) trying to free humanity from
the system while pursued by its guardians, such as [Agent
Smith](Agent_Smith "wikilink") ([Hugo
Weaving](Hugo_Weaving "wikilink")). The story incorporates references to
numerous philosophical, religious, or spiritual ideas, among others the
dilemma of [choice vs. control](Choice "wikilink"), the [brain in a
vat](brain_in_a_vat "wikilink") thought experiment,
[messianism](messianism "wikilink"), and the concepts of
inter-dependency and [love](love "wikilink"). Influences include the
principles of [mythology](mythology "wikilink"),
[anime](anime "wikilink"), and [Hong Kong action
films](Hong_Kong_action_cinema "wikilink") (particularly "[heroic
bloodshed](heroic_bloodshed "wikilink")" and [martial
arts](martial_arts_film "wikilink") movies). The film series is notable
for its use of heavily choreographed action sequences and "[bullet
time](bullet_time "wikilink")" slow motion effects, which revolutionized
action films to come.

The characters and setting of the films are further explored in other
media set in the same [fictional
universe](fictional_universe "wikilink"), including animation, comics,
and video games. The comic "Bits and Pieces of Information" and *[The
Animatrix](The_Animatrix "wikilink")* short film "[The Second
Renaissance](The_Animatrix#"The_Second_Renaissance_Part_I" "wikilink")"
act as prequels to the films, explaining how the franchise's setting
came to be. The video game *[Enter the
Matrix](Enter_the_Matrix "wikilink")* connects the story of the
*Animatrix* short ["Final Flight of the
Osiris"](The_Animatrix#"Final_Flight_of_the_Osiris" "wikilink") with the
events of *Reloaded*, while the online video game *[The Matrix
Online](The_Matrix_Online "wikilink")* was a direct sequel to
*Revolutions*. These were typically written, commissioned, or approved
by the Wachowskis.

The first film was an important critical and commercial success, winning
four [Academy Awards](Academy_Awards "wikilink"), introducing [popular
culture](popular_culture "wikilink") symbols such as the [red pill and
blue pill](red_pill_and_blue_pill "wikilink"), and [influencing action
filmmaking](The_Matrix#Legacy "wikilink"). For those reasons it has been
added to the [National Film Registry](National_Film_Registry "wikilink")
for preservation.[1] Its first sequel was an even bigger commercial
success, becoming the highest-grossing
[R-rated](Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system "wikilink")
film in history until it was surpassed by
*[Deadpool](Deadpool_(film) "wikilink")* in 2016. As of 2006, the
franchise has generated $3 billion in revenue. Warner Bros. Pictures has
officially confirmed that a fourth *Matrix* film is in development with
Village Roadshow Pictures, with Lana Wachowski co-writing and directing
and Reeves and Moss reprising their roles.

## Setting

The series depicts a future in which Earth is dominated by a race of
[self-aware](self-aware "wikilink") machines that was spawned from the
creation of [artificial
intelligence](artificial_intelligence "wikilink") early in the 21st
century. At one point conflict arose between mankind and machines, and
the machines [rebelled against their creators](AI_takeover "wikilink").
Mankind attempted to block out the machines' source of [solar
power](solar_power "wikilink") by covering the sky in thick, stormy
clouds. A massive war emerged between the two adversaries which ended
with the machines victorious, capturing mankind. Having lost their
definite source of energy, the machines devised a way to extract the
human body's [bioelectric](bioelectricity "wikilink") and
[thermal](thermal_energy "wikilink") energies by enclosing people in
pods, while their minds are controlled by [cybernetic
implants](cybernetic_implant "wikilink") connecting them to a [simulated
reality](simulated_reality "wikilink") called the Matrix.

The [virtual reality](virtual_reality "wikilink") world simulated by the
Matrix resembles human civilization around the turn of the 21st century
(this time period was chosen because it is supposedly the pinnacle of
human civilization). The environment inside the Matrix is practically
indistinguishable from reality (although scenes set within the Matrix
are presented on-screen with a green tint to the footage, and a general
bias towards the color green), and the vast majority of humans connected
to it are unaware of its true nature. Most of the central characters in
the series are able to gain [superhuman](superhuman "wikilink")
abilities within the Matrix by taking advantage of their understanding
of its true nature to manipulate its virtual [physical
laws](physical_law "wikilink"). The films take place both inside the
Matrix and outside of it, in the real world; the parts that take place
in the Matrix, are set in a vast [Western
World](Western_World "wikilink") unnamed [megacity](megacity "wikilink")
inside of it.

The virtual world is first introduced in *The Matrix*. The short comic
"Bits and Pieces of Information" and the
*[Animatrix](The_Animatrix "wikilink")* short film *[The Second
Renaissance](The_Second_Renaissance "wikilink")* show how the initial
conflict between mankind and machines came about, and how and why the
Matrix was first developed. Its history and purpose are further
explained in *The Matrix Reloaded*. In *The Matrix Revolutions* a new
[status quo](status_quo "wikilink") is established in the Matrix's place
in mankind and machines' conflict. This was further explored in *[The
Matrix Online](The_Matrix_Online "wikilink")*, a now defunct
[MMORPG](MMORPG "wikilink").

### Future

While making the original trilogy, the Wachowskis told their close
collaborators that at that time they had no intention of making another
*Matrix* film after *The Matrix Revolutions*.[2][3][4][5] In February
2015, in interviews promoting *[Jupiter
Ascending](Jupiter_Ascending "wikilink")*, Lilly Wachowski called a
return to *The Matrix* a "particularly repelling idea in these times",
noting the studios' tendency to greenlight sequels,
[reboots](Reboot_(fiction) "wikilink"), and adaptations over original
material.[6] Meanwhile, Lana Wachowski, addressing rumors about a
potential [reboot](Reboot_(fiction) "wikilink"), said that they had not
heard anything, but she believed that the studio might be looking to
replace them.[7] At various times, Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving stated
that they would be willing to reprise their roles in potential *Matrix*
films, but only if the Wachowskis were involved.[8][9]

####  Untitled fourth film

In May 2019, [Chad Stahelski](Chad_Stahelski "wikilink"), who worked as
stunt coordinator on several films by the Wachowskis including the
*Matrix* trilogy, mentioned the Wachowskis' being involved in a new
*Matrix* film, however, his statement was retracted shortly afterwards,
with the clarification he was speaking hypothetically.[10][11] In June
2019, more unconfirmed reports about the Wachowskis making a new
*Matrix* film followed.[12] In August 2019, [Warner Bros.
Pictures](Warner_Bros._Pictures "wikilink") officially announced the
development of a fourth film to be jointly made with [Village Roadshow
Pictures](Village_Roadshow_Pictures "wikilink"), with Lana Wachowski
serving as co-writer, director, and producer on it, and Keanu Reeves and
Carrie-Anne Moss reprising their roles. Lana wrote the screenplay with
[David Mitchell](David_Mitchell_(author) "wikilink") and [Aleksander
Hemon](Aleksander_Hemon "wikilink"), both of whom she worked with on the
[Netflix](Netflix "wikilink") series *[Sense8](Sense8 "wikilink")*;[13]
Mitchell also wrote the novel *[Cloud
Atlas](Cloud_Atlas_(novel) "wikilink")*, which the Wachowskis had
adapted into a [film](Cloud_Atlas_(film) "wikilink") in 2012. An
impressive script and Reeves' resurgence of stardom following repeated
box office successes were reported as the reasons the studio greenlit
the film.[14][15] In October 2019, [Yahya Abdul-Mateen
II](Yahya_Abdul-Mateen_II "wikilink"), [Jessica
Henwick](Jessica_Henwick "wikilink"), and [Neil Patrick
Harris](Neil_Patrick_Harris "wikilink") were cast, with Abdul-Mateen and
Henwick being lead characters.[16][17][18] The same month, [Jada Pinkett
Smith](Jada_Pinkett_Smith "wikilink"), who played
[Niobe](Niobe_(The_Matrix) "wikilink") in *Reloaded* and *Revolutions*,
was reported to be in negotiations to reprise her role.[19] Prior to the
report, Pinkett Smith was asked on the day of the film's announcement
about the possibility of her involvement with it, and she responded that
she had been in talks with Lana about it.[20]

Crew members include producer [Grant
Hill](Grant_Hill_(producer) "wikilink"), who had various producing roles
in all of the Wachowskis' projects starting with *Reloaded*,
cinematographer [John Toll](John_Toll "wikilink"), who previously worked
with the Wachowskis on the *Cloud Atlas*, *Jupiter Ascending*, and
*Sense8* projects,[21] and [Geof Darrow](Geof_Darrow "wikilink") and
[Steve Skroce](Steve_Skroce "wikilink") returning from the original
trilogy as [concept](concept_art "wikilink") and [storyboard
artists](storyboard_artist "wikilink").[22] The film is set to begin
production in Chicago, in February 2020.[23]

Notable absences from the original films include producer Joel Silver,
who sold his rights to Warner Bros. when he severed ties with them in
2012,[24] and co-creator Lilly Wachowski who was reported to be
unavailable due to her work on the upcoming
[Showtime](Showtime_(TV_network) "wikilink") series *Work in Progress*,
though she gave her blessing to the project.[25] Lilly, although not
directly speaking about this film, has also stated that she is at a
point in her life that she feels attracted to work that depicts [social
issues](social_issues "wikilink") explicitly, rather than as a subtext
in science-fiction.[26]

In October 2019 it was reported that Jada Pinkett would be returning as
Niobe,[27] and in December 2019 [Jonathan
Groff](Jonathan_Groff "wikilink") was also announced as having been cast
in an unannounced role.[28]

#### Other projects

In March 2017, *[The Hollywood
Reporter](The_Hollywood_Reporter "wikilink")* wrote that Warner Bros.
was in the early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise. A
*Matrix* TV series was considered but nixed in prior months, with the
studio now in early negotiations with [Zak Penn](Zak_Penn "wikilink") to
write a treatment for a new film, and interest in hiring [Michael B.
Jordan](Michael_B._Jordan "wikilink") to star. According to the article,
the Wachowskis were not involved at that point.[29] In response to the
report, Penn refuted rumors of a reboot, [remake](remake "wikilink"), or
[continuation](Sequel "wikilink"), stating he was working on stories set
in the established [continuity](Fictional_universe "wikilink").[30]
Potential film ideas that the studio was considering included a
[prequel](prequel "wikilink") film about a young
[Morpheus](Morpheus_(The_Matrix) "wikilink"), or a film about a
descendant of his.[31][32][33] By April 2018, Penn described the script
as being at a nascent stage.[34][35] In September 2019, Jordan addressed
the rumors of his involvement by saying he is flattered, but without
making a definitive statement.[36] In October 2019, Penn confirmed the
script he wrote is set within an earlier time period than the first
three films in the franchise.[37]

## Production

### Development

![](The_Matrix_(logo).png "The_Matrix_(logo).png")

The *Matrix* series includes a trilogy of feature films, all of which
were written and directed by [the Wachowskis](the_Wachowskis "wikilink")
and produced by [Joel Silver](Joel_Silver "wikilink"), starring [Keanu
Reeves](Keanu_Reeves "wikilink"), [Laurence
Fishburne](Laurence_Fishburne "wikilink"), [Carrie-Anne
Moss](Carrie-Anne_Moss "wikilink") and [Hugo
Weaving](Hugo_Weaving "wikilink"). The series was filmed in
[Australia](Australia "wikilink") and began with 1999's *[The
Matrix](The_Matrix "wikilink")*, which depicts the recruitment of hacker
[Neo](Neo_(The_Matrix) "wikilink") into humanity's rebellion against
sentient machines.

The film's mainstream success had backed up the initial idea of making a
trilogy.[38] The sequels, *[The Matrix
Reloaded](The_Matrix_Reloaded "wikilink")* and *[The Matrix
Revolutions](The_Matrix_Revolutions "wikilink")*, were filmed
simultaneously during one [shoot](filmmaking#Production "wikilink")
(under the project codename "The Burly Man"),[39] and released in two
parts in 2003. They tell the story of the impending attack on the human
enclave of [Zion](Zion_(The_Matrix) "wikilink") by a vast machine army.
Neo also learns more about the history of the Matrix and his role as The
One. The sequels also incorporate more ambitious action scenes and
visual effects.

## Reception

### Box office performance

*The Matrix* was highly successful, earning over $460 million worldwide
on a budget of $63M. *Reloaded* was also a commercial success, earning
over $740 million worldwide (albeit at much bigger budget) and becoming
the highest-grossing
[R-rated](Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system "wikilink")
film in history,[40][41] a title which it held for 13 years, until it
was surpassed by the film *[Deadpool](Deadpool_(film) "wikilink")*.[42]
*Revolutions* had the world's first simultaneous release across major
cities all over the world,[43] which for the first time in history
included both a release in China,[44] and a release in
[IMAX](IMAX "wikilink") theaters.[45] Its five-day opening at $204
million broke the previous record,[46] but ultimately the film made $427
million, a little less than the original.

### Critical and public response

While *The Matrix* and *The Matrix Reloaded* received positive
reviews,[47][48] the critical response to *The Matrix Revolutions* was
more negative.[49] One complaint was that *Revolutions* did not give
answers to the questions raised in *Reloaded*.[50]

### Accolades

### Legal claims

In April 2003 Sophia Stewart filed a legal
[complaint](complaint "wikilink") in the [United States District Court
for the Central District of
California](United_States_District_Court_for_the_Central_District_of_California "wikilink")
alleging that the idea of *The Matrix* (and the 1984 film *[The
Terminator](The_Terminator "wikilink")*) were
[plagiarized](plagiarized "wikilink") from her own [film
treatment](film_treatment "wikilink") titled "The Third Eye".[51][52]
The court allowed the lawsuit to move forward in 2005,[53] but Stewart
did not attend the hearing. In a 53-page ruling, Judge Margaret Morrow
dismissed the case, stating that Stewart and her attorneys "had not
entered any evidence to bolster its key claims or demonstrated any
striking similarity between her work and the accused directors’
films."[54][55] Despite the ruling, the case became the subject of
"Internet legend", with many sources claiming Stewart had actually won
the lawsuit.[56][57][58][59]

In 2013 Thomas Althouse filed suit in California federal court alleging
that ideas for the sequels *The Matrix Reloaded* and *The Matrix
Revolutions* came from a screenplay he wrote called *The Immortals*. In
a [summary judgement](summary_judgement "wikilink") for the
[defendants](defendant "wikilink"), Judge R. Gary Klausner stated "The
basic premises of *The Matrix Trilogy* and *The Immortals* are so
different that it would be unreasonable to find their plots
substantially similar."[60][61][62][63][64]

## Influences and interpretations

The *Matrix* films makes numerous references to films and literature,
and to historical myths and philosophy including
[Buddhism](Buddhism "wikilink"), [Vedanta](Vedanta "wikilink"),
[Advaita](Advaita_Vedanta "wikilink") [Hinduism](Hinduism "wikilink"),
[Christianity](Christianity "wikilink"),
[Messianism](Messianism "wikilink"), [Judaism](Judaism "wikilink"),
[Gnosticism](Gnosticism "wikilink"),
[existentialism](existentialism "wikilink"),
[obscurantism](obscurantism "wikilink"), and
[nihilism](nihilism "wikilink"). The films' premise resembles
[Plato](Plato "wikilink")'s [Allegory of the
cave](Allegory_of_the_Cave "wikilink"), [René
Descartes](René_Descartes "wikilink")'s [evil
demon](evil_demon "wikilink"), [Kant](Immanuel_Kant "wikilink")'s
reflections on the [Phenomenon](Phenomenon "wikilink") versus the [Ding
an sich](Noumenon "wikilink"), [Zhuangzi](Zhuangzi_(book) "wikilink")'s
"[Zhuangzi dreamed he was a
butterfly](Zhuangzi_dreamed_he_was_a_butterfly "wikilink")", Marxist
social theory and the [brain in a vat](brain_in_a_vat "wikilink")
thought experiment. Many references to [Jean
Baudrillard](Jean_Baudrillard "wikilink")'s *[Simulacra and
Simulation](Simulacra_and_Simulation "wikilink")* appear in the first
film. Baudrillard himself considered this a misrepresentation,[65]
although Lana Wachowski claims the point the reference was making was
misunderstood.[66] There are similarities to
[cyberpunk](cyberpunk "wikilink") works such as
*[Neuromancer](Neuromancer "wikilink")* by [William
Gibson](William_Gibson "wikilink"),[67] who has described *The Matrix*
as "arguably the ultimate 'cyberpunk' artifact."[68]

Japanese director [Mamoru Oshii](Mamoru_Oshii "wikilink")'s *[Ghost in
the Shell](Ghost_in_the_Shell_(1995_film) "wikilink")* was a strong
influence.[69] Producer Joel Silver has stated that the Wachowskis first
described their intentions for *The Matrix* by showing him that anime
and saying, "We wanna do that for real."[70][71] [Mitsuhisa
Ishikawa](Mitsuhisa_Ishikawa "wikilink") of [Production
I.G](Production_I.G "wikilink"), which produced *Ghost in the Shell*,
noted that the anime's high-quality visuals were a strong source of
inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, "... cyberpunk films
are very difficult to describe to a third person. I'd imagine that *The
Matrix* is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written
proposal for to take to film studios." He stated that since *Ghost in
the Shell* had gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as
a "promotional tool."[72] Similarities to the 1985 anime film *[Megazone
23](Megazone_23 "wikilink")* have also been noticed, but the Wachowskis
claimed to have never seen it.[73]

Reviewers have commented on similarities between *The Matrix* and other
late-1990s films such as *[Strange
Days](Strange_Days_(film) "wikilink")*, *[Dark
City](Dark_City_(1998_film) "wikilink")*, and *[The Truman
Show](The_Truman_Show "wikilink")*.[74][75][76] The Wachowskis claimed
no influence regarding *Dark City*, but commented about it and *The
Truman Show* that they thought it was "very strange that Australia came
to have three films associated with it that were all about the nature of
reality.".[77]

Comparisons have also been made to [Grant
Morrison](Grant_Morrison "wikilink")'s comic series *[The
Invisibles](The_Invisibles "wikilink")*; Morrison believes that the
Wachowskis essentially plagiarized his work to create the film.[78] The
Wachowskis responded that they enjoy the comic but did not use it for
inspiration.[79]

In addition, the similarity of the films' central concept to a device in
the long-running series *[Doctor Who](Doctor_Who "wikilink")* has also
been noted. As in the film, the [Matrix](Matrix_(Doctor_Who) "wikilink")
of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial *[The Deadly
Assassin](The_Deadly_Assassin "wikilink")*) is a massive computer system
which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users
to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics;
but if killed there, they will die in reality.[80]

The first *Matrix* film features numerous references to the "[White
Rabbit](White_Rabbit "wikilink")", the "Rabbit Hole" and mirrors,
referring to [Lewis Carroll](Lewis_Carroll "wikilink")'s *[Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland](Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland "wikilink")*
and *[Through the
Looking-Glass](Through_the_Looking-Glass "wikilink")*.[81][82]

[Matrixism](Matrixism "wikilink") is a [new religious
movement](new_religious_movement "wikilink") inspired by the trilogy. A
[sociologist of religion](sociologist_of_religion "wikilink") [Adam
Possamai](Adam_Possamai "wikilink") describes these types of
religions/spiritualities as hyper-real religions due to their eclectic
mix of religion/spirituality with elements of [popular
culture](popular_culture "wikilink") and their connection to the fluid
[social structures](social_structures "wikilink") of [late
capitalism](late_capitalism "wikilink").[83] There is some debate about
whether followers of Matrixism are indeed serious about their practice;
however, the religion (real or otherwise) has received attention in the
media.[84][85]

Following the Wachowskis' [coming out](coming_out "wikilink") as
[transgender women](transgender_women "wikilink") some years after the
release of the films, the first film and the pill analogy have also been
analyzed in the context of the Wachowskis' transgender experiences. In
this case, taking the red pill and living out of the Matrix symbolizes
exploring one's own [gender identity](gender_identity "wikilink"),
starting the transition and [coming out](coming_out "wikilink") as
transgender, as opposed to a continued life in the closet.[86][87] Lilly
Wachowski has acknowledged this analysis by calling it "a cool thing
because it's an excellent reminder that art is never static".[88]

## Home media

In 2004, [Warner Home Video](Warner_Home_Video "wikilink") released *The
Ultimate Matrix Collection*, a 10-disc set of the films on DVD. It
included the trilogy of films, *The Animatrix*, and six discs of
additional material, including the documentary film *[The Matrix
Revisited](The_Matrix_Revisited "wikilink")*, the live action footage
shot for *Enter the Matrix*, and a promotional compilation of *The
Matrix Online*. For this release, *The Matrix* was
[remastered](remastered "wikilink") under the supervision of the
Wachowskis and the trilogy's
[cinematographer](cinematographer "wikilink"), [Bill
Pope](Bill_Pope "wikilink"), to improve its picture quality and make its
[color timing](color_timing "wikilink") closer to that of its sequels.
At the request of the Wachowskis, as they explain in a written statement
that accompanies the boxset, each of the three films is accompanied by
two [audio commentaries](Audio_commentary "wikilink"), one by
philosophers who liked the films, and another by critics who did not,
with the intention that viewers use them as reference points to form
their own opinion. The compilation includes 35 hours of bonus material,
but some of the [extras](DVD-Video#Extra_features "wikilink") from
earlier, standalone, releases are missing. A *Limited Edition* of *The
Ultimate Matrix Collection* was also released. It encases the ten discs
plus a [resin](resin "wikilink") bust of Neo inside an [acrylic
glass](acrylic_glass "wikilink") box.[89]

*The Ultimate Matrix Collection* was later also released on [HD
DVD](HD_DVD "wikilink") (5 discs) and [Blu-ray](Blu-ray "wikilink") (6
discs) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The HD DVD release added a
picture-in-picture video commentary to the three films and the extras
that were missing from the previous DVD compilation.[90] The Blu-ray
release presented *The Animatrix* in [high definition](1080p "wikilink")
for the first time.[91] A pared-down set dubbed *The Complete Matrix
Trilogy* was also released on HD DVD and Blu-ray (3 discs each), which
dropped *The Animatrix* and some of the special features.[92][93]

The [Ultra HD Blu-ray](Ultra_HD_Blu-ray "wikilink") release of *The
Matrix Trilogy* came out in 2018 (9 discs)[94] and presented the trilogy
in [4K resolution](4K_resolution "wikilink") and [high-dynamic-range
video](high-dynamic-range_video "wikilink"), remastered from the
[original camera negative](original_camera_negative "wikilink") and
supervised by Bill Pope. In this release *The Matrix* is presented with
a color grade that reportedly comes closer to its theatrical
presentation than any of the previous home video releases.[95][96] The
set also includes standard Blu-ray copies of the films sourced from the
new 4K master, but is missing *The Animatrix* and some special
features.[97]

## Other media and merchandising

By August 2000, *The Matrix* [DVD](DVD-Video "wikilink") had sold over
three million copies in United States, becoming the best-selling of all
time.[98] By November 2003, *The Matrix* franchise had generated from
[VHS](VHS "wikilink") and DVD sales, from the [video
game](video_game "wikilink") *[Enter the
Matrix](Enter_the_Matrix "wikilink")* (2003), from *[The Matrix
Reloaded: The Album](The_Matrix_Reloaded:_The_Album "wikilink")*
soundtrack sales, and from licensed merchandise sales.[99] As of 2006,
the franchise has grossed from all sources worldwide.[100][101]

### Animation

In acknowledgment of the strong influence of Japanese
[anime](anime "wikilink") on the *Matrix* series, *The Animatrix* was
produced in 2003 to coincide with the release of *The Matrix Reloaded*.
This is a collection of nine animated short films intended to further
flesh out the concepts, history, characters and setting of the series.
The objective of *The Animatrix* project was to give other writers and
directors the opportunity to lend their voices and interpretation to the
*Matrix* universe; the Wachowskis conceived of and oversaw the process,
and they wrote four of the segments themselves, although they were given
to other directors to execute. Many of the segments were produced by
notable figures from the world of [Japanese
animation](Japanese_animation "wikilink"). Four of the films were
originally released on the series' official website, one was shown in
cinemas with *[Dreamcatcher](Dreamcatcher_(2003_film) "wikilink")*, one
was shown on MTV, MTV2, MTV3, MTV4, and Syfi, and the others first
appeared with the DVD release of all nine shorts shortly after the
release of *The Matrix Reloaded*.

### Video games

On May 15, 2003, the game *[Enter the
Matrix](Enter_the_Matrix "wikilink")* was released in North America
concurrently with *The Matrix Reloaded*. The first of three video games
related to the films, it told a story running parallel to *The Matrix
Reloaded* and featured scenes that were shot during the filming of *The
Matrix Reloaded* and *The Matrix Revolutions*.[102]

Two more *The Matrix* video games were released in 2005. The MMORPG
*[The Matrix Online](The_Matrix_Online "wikilink")* continued the story
beyond *The Matrix Revolutions*,[103] while *[The Matrix: Path of
Neo](The_Matrix:_Path_of_Neo "wikilink")* allowed players to control Neo
in scenes from the film trilogy.[104] *The Matrix Online* was shut down
in 2009.[105]

The *Matrix* official website also provided several original [Adobe
Flash](Adobe_Flash "wikilink")-based [browser
games](browser_game "wikilink").[106][107]

### Comic books

*The Matrix Comics* is a set of [webcomics](webcomics "wikilink") and
[short stories](short_story "wikilink") based on the series and written
and illustrated by figures from the comics industry; one of the comics
was written by the Wachowskis and illustrated by the films' [concept
artist](concept_artist "wikilink") [Geof
Darrow](Geof_Darrow "wikilink").[108] The comics and stories were
originally presented for free on the *Matrix* series' website between
1999 and 2003;[109][110] most of them were later republished by the
Wachowskis' [Burlyman Entertainment](Burlyman_Entertainment "wikilink"),
along with some new material and updates with color,[111] in two printed
[trade paperback](Trade_paperback_(comics) "wikilink") volumes in 2003
and 2004, respectively.[112][113] By September 2004, the first printed
volume had sold over 60,000 copies.[114]

Burlyman is set to publish in November 2019 a deluxe edition of the
comics for the twentieth anniversary of the franchise, combining the two
published volumes and adding four of the webcomics that were missing
from them.[115][116]

### Screensaver

The *Matrix* official website provided a free
[screensaver](screensaver "wikilink") for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS
X, which simulates the falling "[Matrix digital
rain](Matrix_digital_rain "wikilink")" of the films.[117][118] The
screensaver was reported to have a password security issue.[119] The
"Matrix digital rain" also inspired the creation of many unofficial
screensavers.[120]
