**Alternative fashion** is [fashion](fashion "wikilink") that, at least
at one time, stood apart from [mainstream](mainstream "wikilink")
commercial fashion. Alternative fashion includes the fashions of
specific [subcultures](subculture "wikilink") such as
[emo](emo "wikilink"), scene, [goth
subculture](goth_subculture "wikilink"), [hip hop](hip_hop "wikilink"),
[heavy metal fashion](heavy_metal_fashion "wikilink"),
[cyberpunk](cyberpunk "wikilink"), and [Lolita
fashion](Lolita_fashion "wikilink");[1] however, it is not limited to
these. In general, alternative, or 'alt', fashion does not conform to
widely popular style trends of the times that have widespread
popularity. It may exhibit itself as a fringe style – extremely
attention-grabbing and more artistic than practical – but it can also
develop from anti-fashion sentiments that focus on simplistic
utilitarian drives (e.g.: [grunge](grunge "wikilink") fashion, which was
largely based around comfort and availability).

## Historical and sociological perspectives

contrasts fashion designer [Beatrice
Farnham](Beatrice_Farnham "wikilink")'s alternative attire with that of
a modern woman of that era.\]\] Alternative fashion is often considered
a modern concept but it, and the concept of subculture it is often
related to, have existed for centuries. As covered in Ken Gelder's
exploration of the history of alternative culture patterns in Western
society, "Subcultures: Cultural Histories and Social Practice,"
alternative fashions have often been used to identify, and even
stereotype, members of groups with value systems that diverged from
common culture. Gelder states that alternative fashions have
traditionally been related to subcultures that have been identified by
mass society as:

-   disinterested in common moral order: idle, parasitical, hedonistic,
    criminal
-   disinterested in or against adhering to structure of [social
    class](social_class "wikilink")
-   identification with an area (street, neighborhood, club) rather than
    self-owned property
-   preferring to develop "family" and community outside of traditional
    paradigms
-   attitudes against or wary of [mass
    production](mass_production "wikilink"), homogeneity, socially
    imposed behavior constrictions

Those who utilize alternative fashion may vary greatly in beliefs and
not identify with any of these concepts. Often it is the mass social
perceptions of the meaning of certain fashions and their relation to a
particular niche group that is important in understanding the
interaction of alternative fashion with mass culture - a fashion is
often more remembered for what it is related to in the popular
consciousness than what its wearer's intended it to stand for.
Particularly in a sociopolitical sense alternative fashion has often
been intentionally adopted by an individual or group to display a break
from the beliefs or mores of popular culture and as a form of
self-expression that challenged the boundaries of what was considered
appropriate, fashionable or practical.[2] The meaning behind a certain
style, or said style even having a meaning, is up for debate between
individual wearers and those outside the style.

The use of [subculture](subculture "wikilink") terminology in the 21st
century to categorize or interpret dress style is often inaccurate, or
at the least does not provide a complete picture of the individual being
assessed by their 'look,' due to the constant evolution in the meaning,
relevance and cohesion of certain subcultures and even the term
'subculture' itself.[3] Alternative fashion is often looked at through
the lens of social politics - it is considered a visual expression of
opposition to societal norms, thus heavily associated with the idealism,
energy and rebellion of youth culture.[4][5] However, sociological
studies into exploring alternative fashion have found individuals who
retained statistically uncommon modes of dress on a permanent
post-adolescent basis.[6] Alternative fashion generally lays down a
challenge to accepted norms, though the reactions received by wearers of
alternative fashion from those who adhere to more conventional stylings
can be as diverse as the wearers themselves. It can be a visual language
that people employ to communicate with each other [7][8] indicating
common interests or involvement with similar activities, a challenge to
modern conceptions of aesthetic beauty and/or a basic form of
self-expression, like painting or writing.[9] It may be none of these
things - the wearer may have no conscious intent in the choosing of
their style and may find themselves outside the mainstream purely by
accident.

## Common influences

Modern individual alternative fashion genres, and their wearers, may
have homogenized or diverse influences that vary from group to group and
person to person but some basic similarities do exist across the scope
of alt fashion. Some prominent examples of influences, regardless of
genre or label, are:

-   vintage and retro fashion trends that have fallen out of favor with
    the general population (e.g.: [Pin-up girl](Pin-up_girl "wikilink"),
    [Rockabilly](Rockabilly "wikilink"), [New
    Romanticism](New_Romanticism "wikilink"), [Victorian
    fashion](Victorian_fashion "wikilink"), etc.)which are revived or
    incorporated by a new generation
-   dress styles, traditional and modern, from other cultures (such as
    [Japanese street fashion](Japanese_street_fashion "wikilink")) Such
    as [Harajuku](Harajuku "wikilink"), and decora
-   various forms of visual and performance art, including painting,
    sculpture, film and television
-   notable personalities - authors, models, musicians, actors, etc.
-   personal tastes and aesthetics
-   personal attitudes towards concepts such as individuality,
    consumerism, social constructs on behavior, self-expression, and/or
    disenfranchisement with what is viewed as "normal" society [10][11]
-   considerations of availability and utilitarianism

Like many other aspects of alternative culture, alt fashion is often
heavily influenced by music and the dress style of individual bands or
musicians.[12] While the qualities of individuality and open-mindedness
are associated with alternative fashion, levels of conformity within
subcultures, judgemental behaviors and expressions of feelings of
superiority exist within certain alternative fashion communities just as
they exist in aspects of mainstream fashion and culture. Pressure to
'fit in,' even just within a small niche community, may influence
personal style.[13]

## Changes in availability

As alternative fashion can relate to such a diverse selection of styles
the acquisition of clothing, accessories and services (such as hair
care) can come from a huge variety of resources, particularly as
alternative fashion trends become more accepted and assimilated into
mainstream culture.[14] Traditionally alternative clothing, shoes and
accessories have been largely procured from independently owned
businesses, such as the boutiques found in bohemian and artistic
districts of large urban centers. Though still popular, these type of
small, specialized retailers have become displaced much like mainstream
retail outlets by the Internet. Also, as fashion trends are co-opted by
more and more people chain stores, which may offer a wider variety of
product at a lower price and are easier to access in non-urban areas
than boutiques, began to soak up a large part of the alternative fashion
market. This change in the availability and
[commodification](commodification "wikilink") of alternative fashions
has encouraged much broader use of styles in the mainstream once only
found in niche groups. Items from thrift & vintage shops, altered and
DIY fashions have also long held a place in alternative fashion to the
point where the use of mismatched second-hand clothing is considered
cliche to alternative and liberal ideologies.[15]

## Mainstream attention

Many forms of alternative fashion gain attention, and even notoriety,
through their relationship to individuals or groups that are seen as
socially undesirable – those involved in behavior considered criminal,
deviant or anti-social – even though these types of behaviors may not be
common among those involved in alternative fashion.[16][17] For
instance, greasers of the 1950s were associated with street gangs and
random acts of juvenile violence, hippies of the 1960s (along with
ravers of the 1980–90s) with promiscuity, anti-establishment agendas
and, especially, drug use and those sporting hip hop style in the
1980s-now with the selling of drugs and other criminal behavior. The
most headline-grabbing event in recent years related to alternative
fashion was the wave of anti-Gothic policies and commentary that flooded
through common culture in the wake of the [Columbine High School
massacre](Columbine_High_School_massacre "wikilink"). The crime,
perpetrated by two young men dressed in black trench coats who were
known to be fans of heavy, dark themed music, was immediately associated
with the Gothic subculture in the media despite the teens' lack of any
concrete affiliation with the dress or musical style usually given this
label. Policies were passed in schools across the country banning dress
styles and items associated with the Gothic subculture. Many individuals
who dressed in any way related to Gothic style, whether or not they
associated with this subculture, were targets of fear, anger and
suspicion.[18] The subculture as a whole, though extremely diverse in
religious and social beliefs, was pigeonholed by the media as a
dangerous influence on children.[19]

## Alternative fashion's influence on mainstream fashion

Mainstream culture, particularly retailers and the media, have often
looked to alternative fashion for up and coming trends and,
increasingly, as an easy way to market products to a niche group that
may not be having its tastes supplied elsewhere.[20] Some in the
alternative community view this as flattering and as a positive
expansion of what is socially acceptable, and easily available, fashion.
Others consider the involvement of mainstream institutions in
alternative fashion as a desecration of what the concept stands for and
feel the mass marketing of previously underground styles, particularly
to impressionable youth markets who are more concerned with a look than
the meaning behind it, amounts to a non-violent form of cultural
genocide. When a previously non-mainstream style becomes popular the
core group of a certain alternative niche may be watered down with
dozens or even hundreds of individuals who are not genuinely invested in
the advancement of alternative culture or its precepts of individuality
and present an image of the subculture not at all related to its
traditional members' behaviors.[21] For instance, rave culture was
heavily associated with ideas of racial, gender and sexual orientation
equality and encouraged unity, creativity and individuality amongst its
members.[22] The commodification of rave fashions in chain outlets and
internet boutiques coincided with a media frenzy focusing on drug use in
the rave community. These factors led to an insurgence of young people
interested in emulating rave style, and obtaining the substances
associated with it, rather than in promoting the utopian precepts
originally associated with raves.[23]

Alternative fashion is expressed, discussed, viewed and proliferated
through many of the same channels as mainstream fashion, such as fashion
shows, websites, blogs and magazines. The use of these avenues in the
alt community traditionally tend to follow similar principles to
traditional alt fashion itself - existing outside of mainstream outlets,
fueled by personal creativity. It is common for projects related to
alternative fashion to be independently run by individuals or small
groups and to be offered to the public cheaply or free of charge.
However, just as alternative fashion has been commodified by chain
stores some level of commercialization may exist within outlets of
alternative fashion seeking to exploit certain styles as 'the next big
thing' or taking financial advantage of customers with limited options.
The sheer volume of literature about alternative and subculture
fashion,ranging from serious sociological studies to 'guide books' for
the casual reader,[24] display how involved, or at least interested, in
alternative fashion a large portion of society is.
