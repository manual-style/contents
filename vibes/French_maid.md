**French maid** is a strongly modified style of
[servant's](/domestic_worker "wikilink") dress that evolved from typical
[housemaid's](/maid "wikilink") black-and-white afternoon uniforms of
[19th-century France](/France_in_the_long_nineteenth_century "wikilink")
(and their later use by stereotypical [soubrette](/soubrette "wikilink")
characters in [burlesque](/burlesque "wikilink") dramas and [bedroom
farces](/bedroom_farce "wikilink")). Some styles are conservative while
others are revealing. The French maid costume is often used in
[cosplay](/cosplay "wikilink"), [sexual
roleplaying](/sexual_roleplay "wikilink"), and [uniform
fetishism](/Uniform_fetishism#French_maid_uniform "wikilink"). Depending
on design details, some forms can be classified as
[lingerie](/lingerie "wikilink").

## Costume details

Though not strict to historically accurate uniforms, the French maid
outfit has an easily recognizable pattern and black-and white theme that
remains the template for other forms of the costume.

The typical French maid costume includes:

-   A black dress with white trim, with a full skirt at or above knee
    length.
-   White half-apron, usually with ruffle or lace
-   A ruffled or lace headpiece
-   Long stockings or tights. These can be white or black and vary from
    design to design.
-   High heels
-   [Feather duster](/Feather_duster "wikilink")
-   White or black lace [garter](/garter_(stockings) "wikilink")

Optional accessories depend on design and context:

-   [Choker](/Choker "wikilink") necklace
-   Pearls
-   Other cleaning equipment

## Culture

The outfits are frequently worn to fancy dress or [costume
parties](/costume_parties "wikilink"), and also used in drama/theater.
