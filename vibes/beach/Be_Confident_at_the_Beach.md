Are you one of those girls who always worry about their looks? You're
afraid to go of without makeup? You think you don't have the most
attractive body? Not anymore! Here are some tips on how to be confident
and feel beautiful with no makeup at the beach.

## Steps

1.  Be able to accept yourself without makeup. You are gorgeous! Look at
    yourself at the mirror and learn how to feel pretty. Makeup is not a
    solution. If you want to wear some makeup,make sure it is
    waterproof, because you don't wanna look like a wet panda when you
    get out of the water. If you have any blemishes or freckles that you
    don't feel so confident about, wear concealer! Most of them are
    waterproof. You can also put a little bit of foundation or BB
    cream.![](Be_Confident_at_the_Beach_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_Confident_at_the_Beach_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Love yourself in a bikini. Okay, so, this is little bit harder. You
    need to accept your body the way it is. Find a bikini who suits
    you,and matches your skin tone. You'll be having so much fun, you'll
    forget about your little
    belly.![](Be_Confident_at_the_Beach_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Confident_at_the_Beach_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Wear a sunscreen. Make sure it is good quality. By having a tan,
    you'll look like you're having fun, and you'll feel more beautiful.
    Anyways,who wants to be pail on the beach? Or to have red spots all
    over their body? WEAR A
    SUNSCREEN!![](Be_Confident_at_the_Beach_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_Confident_at_the_Beach_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Have fun. Buy a ball,so you can play volleyball on the sand, and in
    the water. Learn the flips,they're so much
    fun!![](Be_Confident_at_the_Beach_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Confident_at_the_Beach_Step_4.jpg")
5.  SMILE! If you like a boy you saw at the beach,or the guy that sells
    ice cream? Just smile at him. He won't be able to forget you.
    Also,smile is a way to feel more
    confident.![](Be_Confident_at_the_Beach_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_Confident_at_the_Beach_Step_5.jpg")
