Being a beach babe is all about having a low-maintenance, laid-back
style and attitude while having fun on the beach. Whether you’re on
vacation at the shore or heading down to your local beach, you can
achieve the beach babe look and personality with just a few simple
changes to your wardrobe and attitude.

## Steps

### Looking Like a Beach Babe

1.  Pick out a fun bathing suit. Wear a bikini or a pretty one-piece
    that makes you feel comfortable and cute. Try a bathing suit in a
    bright color or pattern you wouldn’t normally wear. Slip into a
    wetsuit or rash guard, too, if you’re going
    surfing.![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Try a white or neon bathing suit to bring out the tan in your
        skin. Or go with bright red for that classic Baywatch-inspired
        beach babe look![1]
    -   Choose a one-piece or a tankini if you want to cover up your
        tummy. If you have a larger chest, a structured suit with
        underwire is a great choice; if you have a smaller chest, go for
        ruffles or embellishment on the top.[2]
2.  Wear beachy clothes. Slip on a light swimsuit coverup, a flowing
    patterned dress, or a bright t-shirt, tank, or crop top with shorts.
    Remember to coordinate colors or patterns with your bathing suit if
    you can! Top your look with a big sun hat, straw cowboy hat, or
    cap.![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Bring along a warm layer, like a light blanket, a hoodie, or a
        cute knit poncho, if you’re headed to the beach at night.
3.  Get the hairstyle. Wear your hair in a loose bun or ponytail, or
    down and tousled. Get beachy waves if you have straight hair by
    keeping it in braids before letting it down, or putting wet hair
    into four small buns before bed and letting your hair loose in the
    morning.[3] If you have curly hair or an afro, let it loose or try
    tiny
    braids.![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Try a salt spray product, or make your own by combining sea salt
        and water in a spray bottle. You can also add coconut oil and
        leave-in conditioner to the mix to keep hair moisturized.[4]
    -   For natural sun-kissed blonde highlights, combine fresh lemon
        juice or chamomile tea with water in a spray bottle and spray
        from the middle to ends of your hair before going out in the
        sun. Do this regularly to start seeing a difference in your hair
        color.[5]
4.  Take it easy on makeup. Don’t wear any makeup at all, or stick to a
    light lip gloss or chapstick. You can wear mascara, but make sure
    it’s the waterproof
    variety.![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Try a chapstick that has built-in SPF for a soft shine that will
        also keep your lips from getting sunburned or dried and chapped
        from the wind.
    -   Use a tinted moisturizer with SPF, which will provide your face
        with moisture, sun protection, and foundation all in one.
5.  Wear minimal accessories. Choose some simple sunglasses and straw
    cowboy hat or other sun hat, and go barefoot or in flip-flops or
    other sandals. Opt for simple, beach-inspired jewelry like a braided
    necklace, bracelet, or ankle bracelet with a few shells or beads.
    Bring along a cute and colorful beach bag to carry your towel,
    sunscreen, and water
    bottle.![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
6.  [Get a tan](Get_a_Dark_Tan_in_the_Sun "wikilink"). You will
    naturally get a glowing tan by spending lots of time on the beach,
    but do it well by applying plenty of sunscreen, being in the sun for
    short periods of time, and moisturizing your skin before and after.
    Use a tinted lotion as well for an extra boost of bronze and
    shine.![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Use a sunscreen that's SPF 15 or higher, apply it 30 minutes
        before you go outside, and reapply it after every two hours and
        after every time you get wet or sweaty.[6]
    -   Bring along an umbrella and chair as well, so that you can get a
        break from the sun every once in awhile.

### Acting Like a Beach Babe

1.  Act fun and flirty. Whether you’re naturally outgoing or a quieter
    type, bring out your best flirty side and down-for-anything
    attitude. Go to the beach with good friends so you’re more
    comfortable. Try flirting with a surfer by talking to them about how
    long they’ve been surfing (and ask if they can teach you!), or chat
    with a lifeguard about the
    surf.![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you have a more reserved personality, just chill out solo by
        laying out to tan on a towel or chair while listening to music
        or reading a book or magazine. Quiet and mysterious can make for
        a beach babe attitude too!
    -   Be easy and go with the flow! Just walk away from friends who
        are engaged in an argument or other drama, and easily accept
        when there’s a change of plans or new idea in your group. Beach
        babe attitude is all about being laid back and carefree!
2.  Participate in beach activities. Play beach volleyball, toss a
    frisbee, or skateboard on the boardwalk. Learn to surf, boogie
    board, or swim in the ocean. You can also try out sailing, jet
    skiing, or water skiing to adventure further offshore. Check out the
    boardwalk or nearby rental places to ask how you can get a lesson on
    boogie boarding, surfing, or boating, and where to rent or buy all
    the necessary
    equipment.![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you’re vacationing or new in town, talk to locals about beach
        parties or other fun things to participate in on the shore.
3.  Learn the lingo. Incorporate some classic surfer speak into your
    conversations, like “totally,” “radical,” “dude,” and “far out!” You
    can also pick up some terms related to the surf like “gnarly” or “da
    kine” when the waves are great for surfing, or “ankle biters” when
    they’re too
    small.[7]![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Make beach friends. Head down to the beach and strike up a
    conversation! Join in with a group of beachgoers and ask them what
    they do for fun around the shore. Jump into a beach volleyball game,
    or join a group that regularly plays a beach sport to get active and
    meet new
    people.![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")

### Living Like a Beach Babe

1.  Get to the beach as often as possible. If you live near the beach,
    make an effort to be there every day or every weekend if you can.
    Or, if you’re taking a vacation to a beach locale, do some research
    and pick a spot where there are popular beaches for sunbathing,
    surfing, or other water sports, depending on what you’re looking to
    do.![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_11.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_11.jpg")
    -   Make sure you know what the water temperature is if you’re
        planning on swimming or surfing! The Atlantic Ocean is generally
        a lot warmer than the Pacific, for example. Be prepared with a
        wetsuit if necessary.
    -   If you’re vacationing, try heading to a warmer location in the
        winter months, like Mexico, Bali, or the Caribbean, to maximize
        beach time.
2.  Get a job near the beach. If you live in a beach town, get paid to
    spend more time on the beach and support your lifestyle by getting a
    job as a surf instructor, a lifeguard, or a salesperson or server at
    beachside shops and
    restaurants.![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_12.jpg")
3.  Head to the beach early to catch the surf. Get out to the beach in
    the early morning to catch the best waves (or just to chat up some
    surfers!). Check out local tide charts, buoy reports, and
    information about the breaks at a given beach to find the best times
    and conditions for great
    surf.![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_13.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_13.jpg")
4.  Check out beach parties at night. Though you’ll probably spend most
    of your time on the beach during the day, head down on weekend
    nights to see if there’s a bonfire, party, or other event going on
    and join in the
    fun.![](Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_14.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Babe_Step_14.jpg")

## Tips

-   Be true to yourself! You don’t need to change who you are to be a
    beach babe. Wear and do what you truly enjoy, and you will be
    naturally attractive and fun to be around.

## Warnings

-   Be safe when swimming, surfing, or any other activities in the
    ocean, as rough surf and riptides can be dangerous. Pay attention to
    any warning signs, stay out of the water during high winds and
    storms, and never go in without a lifeguard present.
-   If you have color-treated hair, stay away from hair products that
    contain salt. They will make your color fade faster.
