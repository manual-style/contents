If you've ever wanted to be the kind of girl who loves the beach and
looks like it, read on!

## Steps

1.  Go shopping. Get nice, oceanic friendly attire. Get a few beach
    dresses, tank tops, long skirts, bikinis or one-pieces, (whichever
    you're more comfortable in), flip-flops, ripped jeans, big
    sunglasses, denim shorts, shell necklaces and earrings, hemp
    bracelets, etc. Also, get some fun beach towels. Bright patterns are
    always fun, but whatever you like, get it. Stick to these general
    rules, but get what you want to wear. If you want, you can also
    check out some popular brands such as Rip Curl, Roxy, Billabong,
    Rusty and Quicksilver. They can be found in Pacsun, or sometimes T.
    J. Maxx or Marshalls for lower prices. These can be expensive, but
    you can often buy them cheaper on Ebay. Also, you may want to buy a
    few fun things for the beach, like a matching beach bag, umbrella,
    towel, hat, and maybe even CD
    player!![](Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Give yourself a mani-pedi. You want your feet to look good in
    flip-flops so make sure your feet are soft, smooth, and free of
    cracks and calluses. Use a coarse scrub, pumice stone, a thick
    moisturizing cream, and thin cotton socks to cover them with before
    going to bed. Take off the socks in the morning. Bare nails should
    be clean, trimmed, and neatly filed. Always wear a shade of nail
    polish in a nice color such as pink, peach, coral, or red. Always
    reapply if they become
    chipped.![](Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Get a tan. It doesn't have to be very noticeable, but a little color
    looks good on everybody. A self tanner is the safest way to achieve
    that sexy sun-kissed glow without putting yourself at risk for
    wrinkles and skin cancer. Its also a great way to instantly cover up
    skin imperfections like scars and stretch marks. Whether you're at
    the beach or pool, always wear a sunscreen with a SPF level of 20 or
    higher when spending time outside, even if you do not burn. Your
    skin will thank you for it in the
    long-run.![](Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Learn to swim, if you don't know how already. If you do, work on it
    a lot, never hesitate to take advice or learn a different
    stroke.![](Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Don't do your hair too much. Curls and waves look cute on the beach.
    So do fishtail braids and messy up-do's. The key is to look natural
    so stay away from heat stylers. Although blonde is the ultimate
    beach hair colour, any color can look sun-kissed when you put a few
    highlights in
    it.![](Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Keep your legs smooth. If you don't like using razors, pick up some
    Nair or a similar product to remove the hair. Never leave the house
    with hairy arms, legs, bikini lines, and armpits if you wouldn't do
    so in a
    swimsuit.![](Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Keep makeup natural. You don't even have to wear any makeup at all!
    But if you do, wear a light amount and keep it simple. All a natural
    beach beauty really needs is two coats of waterproof mascara, a hint
    of light shimmery eyeshadow at the inner corners of the eyes, a
    touch of peachy blush or bronzer, and a slick of sheer, nude or pink
    lipgloss. Save the eyeliner for a night out and other special
    occasions.![](Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_7.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Spend lots of time at the beach! Swim, surf, or do something else.
    Have fun
    too!![](Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_8.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Don't dye your hair blonde when your hair was just brown two days
    ago. It will only look fake. Natural is
    key!!![](Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_9.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Girl_Step_9.jpg")

## Tips

-   Don't straighten your hair if you want to look like you belong on
    the beach! Curly/wavy hair is super cute for the beach!
-   If you are impressing the guys, put on some waterproof makeup.
-   Take hula or tahitian dance lessons. This is a fun way to stay fit
    during the summer and is usually done near a beach. You don't need
    to do hula or tahitian dance to be a beach girl, but it can
    definitely help.

## Warnings

-   Be careful when you go out in the sun; apply an adequate amount of
    sunblock.
