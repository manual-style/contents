Do you want to achieve a beach look and look like a Californian? Here
are some steps to help you become a "beach teen".

## Steps

1.  Style your hair to get a natural, relaxed look. Most beach girls
    usually just have their hair wavy and natural or straight, with a
    fringe (side bangs). If you have short hair, blow dry your hair
    inwards and get side bangs so they lie across your face. If you have
    long hair, do the same thing. If you want that wavy hair look, sleep
    with your hair wet in braids. If you have nappy hair, just put your
    in an
    afro.![](Define_Curly_Hair_Step_4.jpg "fig:Define_Curly_Hair_Step_4.jpg")
2.  Go natural on the make-up. If you live in a cold area and can't get
    a tan, then get a bronzer. Wear eyeliner, and mascara and some
    blush. Apply the liner to the bottom lid, and mascara to the top.
    It's even better if you don't wear any makeup, just to be
    natural.![](Put_Together_a_Makeup_Kit_Step_11.jpg "fig:Put_Together_a_Makeup_Kit_Step_11.jpg")
3.  Dress Hawaiian/beach style. Any Hawaiian shell necklace or bracelets
    is fine. Going for T-shirts and shorts, mini skirts, hoodies, and
    vans is a
    must.![](Be_a_Beach_Teen_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Teen_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Spend time at a beach. This seems obvious, but there's no use
    looking like a beach teen if you do not enjoy the beach scene. Get
    together with other beach teens, relax and read, play beach
    volleyball, and do other beach
    activities.![](Be_a_Beach_Teen_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_a_Beach_Teen_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Wear your swimsuit as much as you can in your free time. This will
    put you in the beach mood and/or give you the beach
    attitude.![](Look_Beautiful_at_the_Beach_Step_7.jpg "fig:Look_Beautiful_at_the_Beach_Step_7.jpg")
6.  Look at yourself in your swimsuit in private in front of a mirror to
    see if you need to follow an exercise program and/or watch your
    nutrition more closely. When you hit the beach, you will want to
    look your
    best.![](Improve_Your_5K_Race_Time_Step_3.jpg "fig:Improve_Your_5K_Race_Time_Step_3.jpg")
