Do you want to be gorgeous, have lots of friends and maybe even a
boyfriend, and an amazing, summery personality? Read on.

## Steps

1.  Every color of hair is beautiful, but make sure it's a style that
    suits you and your personality. Love whatever your natural texture
    is, and really play it up. If you just can't deal with the frizz,
    try straightening it with a good quality ceramic straightener, or
    try getting lose waves with a curling iron, or even use sea salt
    spray to get those natural, beachy waves!. If you can't afford these
    things or if your parents won't let you use them then just put it up
    in a cute messy
    bun!![](Get_Curly_Hair_Without_a_Perm_Intro.jpg "fig:Get_Curly_Hair_Without_a_Perm_Intro.jpg")
2.  Make sure your skin is as clear as you can get it. It's okay if it's
    not absolutely flawless, but try to get to the point where you only
    need a tiny amount of foundation or other makeup to make it perfect
    looking.![](Treat_Acne_Around_the_Lips_Fast_Step_5.jpg "fig:Treat_Acne_Around_the_Lips_Fast_Step_5.jpg")
3.  Keep your nails medium length- as in not so short that it looks like
    you bite them, but not as long as dragon lady talons. You can play
    around with colors if you like, but a clear coat is always polished
    and natural looking. If you want a color, try summery, light colors
    like coral, light pink, purples, oranges, or for winter, a nice deep
    red or plum. No
    black.![](Do_Striped_Nail_Art_with_Rhinestones_Step_1.jpg "fig:Do_Striped_Nail_Art_with_Rhinestones_Step_1.jpg")
4.  Keep your clothes ironed and fresh smelling. Abercrombie and Fitch
    and Hollister are great places to buy some great clothes. Buy a few
    pairs of light and dark wash jeans, but remember that rips are just
    a fad. Wear lots of light, flattering colors in tank tops, tees, or
    sweaters. V-necks are always really flattering on most body
    types.![](Layer_Clothes_Step_3.jpg "fig:Layer_Clothes_Step_3.jpg")
5.  Skirts are good. Abercrombie/Hollister ones, especially. Make sure
    it's short. Try ones with little shreds in them. They look super
    beachy with belts,
    too.![](Be_a_Hot_Beachy_Girl_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_a_Hot_Beachy_Girl_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Flip flops are a must. Any cute ones. Not too colorful ones, but
    neutral beige/black/white ones, they're like $16 at
    Abercrombie.![](Be_a_Hot_Beachy_Girl_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_a_Hot_Beachy_Girl_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Wear long necklaces,wooden ones look really
    beautiful.![](Look_Stunning_for_School_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Stunning_for_School_Step_4.jpg")
8.  Make up is amazing because it can transform anyone, but don't be
    fooled that you need a ton of makeup. Just keep it really light and
    simple. You don't even have to wear it at all! You are beautiful the
    way you are and you don't need to hide
    it!![](Look_Like_Trashy_Life_Step_6.jpg "fig:Look_Like_Trashy_Life_Step_6.jpg")
    -   A tiny dab of concealer under the eyes to cover darkness, and a
        bit around the nose and on any blemishes. Try not to use
        concealer on zits unless it's really bugging you because it just
        clogs up your pores.
    -   Put a bit of mascara on just the top lashes (you can curl them
        to really open up your eyes!), a bit of peachy colored blush,
        and lip gloss or chap stick, or a natural colored lipstick.
        Another amazing beauty product is bronzer. But you don't have
        use it.

## Tips

-   Be confident. Why not just *look* beautiful if you can believe it
    too?
-   Don't forget that you're beautiful!
-   Wear eyeliner at parties.

## Warnings

-   Don't get *too* confident. People will think you are a jerk.
-   Don't dress out of your comfort zone, though. The hottest beachy
    girls don't do that, they respect their own needs.
-   Eyeliner can make your eyes look small.
