Every young woman wants that beach-beautiful look Island Girls have. If
you want to be bikini-beach hot, here are some tips on how to look like
you have that fresh-from-Hawaii look.

## Steps

1.  Stay true to
    yourself.![](Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_1.jpg")
    -   In Hawaii, diverse cultures, religions, and people are accepted.
        Racism is completely off limits.
    -   An island girl is never ashamed of her family. Family in the
        islands is very important. So your friends saw you at the mall
        with your mother, so what? She's the woman that has taken care
        of you, all of your life with her. Never be ashamed of your
        heritage.
2.  Be food aware. Despite the slim figures you see walking down Waikiki
    beach, with perfect crispy-brown tans, Islanders have mastered a
    quality diet. They actually eat a variety of food. Of all different
    flavors and
    cultures.![](Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_2.jpg")
    -   One food that is so cute and tasty and portable is musubi. You
        can make it at home, and its very good. What keeps them thin is
        the fact that they jam pack their activities that help them
        spend time with family and friends. Going to the beach, going to
        the movies, surfing, skateboarding, catching the city bus to go
        to the mall, running to the store to buy snacks to sit outside
        on the front porch and eat, riding bikes around the
        neighborhood, and anything else physical.
3.  Take care of your skin. Island skin is always tan, but always be
    careful with the sun, UV levels, and other
    things.![](Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_3.jpg")
    -   Always wear sunscreen at the beach or pool, and put lotion on
        all over after you shower. If you don't have the exfoliating and
        acne-clearing power of the ocean where you live, use a body
        scrub and acne wash. Island Girls always have a natural tan.
4.  Wear little to no makeup. And if they do, they don't use much. Try
    scrubbing your lips with a toothbrush after you brush your teeth to
    get rid of dead skin and reveal the color underneath. The sun will
    sunburn your cheeks a little so you won't need
    blush.![](Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Don't shave your facial hair. Only shave body hair. Use smooth away
    or pluck unwanted facial
    hair.![](Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Grow your hair long. The sun will highlight your hair if you go
    swimming at the beach a lot, but if you must, get highlights from
    the salon. They aren't as pretty, but they are remotely the
    same.![](Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_6.jpg")
    -   All hair types are beautiful: straight, wavy, curly. They look
        better long and highlighted. Unless your hair is very frizzy, of
        course, then you have to blow dry and ultra-condition.
    -   Keep your hair clean and conditioned. Wash it every day, or
        every other day.
    -   Put it in any style you want, but usually Island girls put their
        hair in buns, pony tails, or just left down.
7.  Remember comfort and casual. Firstly, buy lots of tankinis and
    bikinis and one pieces and board shorts. Board shorts are actually a
    staple for us. Jean shorts, cuffed knee jeans, skinny jeans, skirts
    that end just above the knee, leather belts, leather flip flops (we
    actually just call them slippers here, but anyway), rubber flip
    flops, slip on shoes, converse, gladiator sandals, basketball shorts
    and oversized tee's and sweat pants (for those casual days and
    weekends), leggings, Ugg boots (for winter), surfer hats (those
    baseball caps from Billabong and Roxy), tank tops, tee's, hoodies,
    bomber jackets, furry jackets, oversized jackets, and all types of
    jewelry. They don't have to be wooden jewelry, but anything you
    like. And you can add anything else that you like to the
    list.![](Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_7.jpg "fig:Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Spend lots of time swimming. There are a lot of open beaches easily
    available. Use what you have. If all you have is a pool, enjoy
    yourself
    there.![](Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_8.jpg "fig:Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Try to be as natural as possible, try not to be too
    fake.![](Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_9.jpg "fig:Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_9.jpg")
10. If you must put on makeup, try to keep your skin perfect, and use
    lip stain (it stays on like its natural), cream blush, and
    mascara.![](Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_10.jpg "fig:Be_a_Real_Island_Girl_Step_10.jpg")

## Tips

-   Don't act like you are better than anyone else. You're no less than
    anyone, but you're not better than anyone. You're as unique and
    special as the next person.
-   Try to keep it as natural as possible!
-   Don't wear anything that says "Island Girl" if you don't live on an
    island, or have never been to one, or aren't part islander at all.
    It's not a good idea to be fake.

## Warnings

-   Be careful with the suntans. Tanned skin is damaged skin. It's too
    easy to develop cancer as it is. Don't rush things.
-   If you ever go to a beach with a shark warning, do not go in the
    water. Not even wading distance. You can stay on the shore and do
    your tanning, and eat musubi and take pictures with your friends,
    but don't go in the water.
