When you go to the beach, all you truly need is a bathing suit! Wear a
cover-up, hat, and sunglasses to protect against the sun. If you want to
easily go out to eat or hit the boardwalk, wear a tank and shorts or
maxi dress. Throw all of your stuff in a canvas beach tote, and wear
flip-flops or sandals to the shore. With a few items, you can easily
dress for the beach.

## Steps

### Choosing Feminine Bathing Suits

1.  Choose a [bikini](Choose-a-Bikini "wikilink") if you want a fun and
    flirty two-piece bathing suit. Select a bikini top with underwire if
    you want extra support, or go with a thin strappy set for a flirty,
    sexy choice. Pick your favorite style, color, and you’ll be ready
    for the
    beach![1]![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_1.jpg")
    -   For instance, choose a hot pink bikini for a cute option, or go
        for a floral pattern for a summertime style.
2.  Try a one-piece or tankini for a more conservative style. Tankinis
    are also a two-piece style, but they have a more modest top.
    One-piece bathing suits come in open-back, deep “V” necklines, and
    monokini options if you want a flirty touch. These bathing suits
    come in all sorts of patterns and colors, so choose one that catches
    your eye and suits your
    style.[2]![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_2.jpg")
    -   Women’s bathing suit tops usually are sized by bust measurement,
        and bottoms often correspond to your pant size.
    -   A monokini is a one-piece style with an open back and cut-outs
        on the side. This is essentially a bikini that also covers your
        tummy.
3.  Mix and match your bathing suit tops and bottoms for a versatile
    look. If you have a few pairs of bikinis or tankinis, consider
    swapping out certain tops and bottoms to customize your swimwear.
    This is a great way to change up your style and add a personal touch
    to your
    outfit.[3]![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_3.jpg")
    -   For instance, if you have a royal blue bikini and a polka-dotted
        tankini, you can wear the polka dotted tankini top with the blue
        bottoms.
    -   If you are wearing a feminine style bathing suit, you can wear
        boardshorts in addition to your bathing suit bottoms. They can
        be more comfortable when walking around the boardwalk or taking
        a stroll down the shore.

### Rocking Swimming Trunks and Boardshorts

1.  Select a pair of swimming trunks for a masculine style. Swim trunks
    are made out of waterproof material, and they dry very quickly once
    you hop out of the water. You can choose neutral-colored trunks for
    a subtle style, or try a bright pair for a summery look. Shades of
    blue, orange, and green are great
    choices.[4]![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_4.jpg")
    -   Men’s bathing suits are sized based off of your waist
        measurement.
2.  Try boardshorts for another quick-drying bathing suit option. These
    shorts are made from a quick-drying material, but they may not be
    completely waterproof. Choose a colorful pair or a boardshort with a
    cool, summery
    pattern.[5]![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_5.jpg")
    -   If you plan on walking up and down the boardwalk or beach, go
        with a pair of boardshorts for comfort and style.
3.  Wear a swim shirt or rash guard to keep you covered. Swim shirts and
    rash guards are short-sleeve or long-sleeve, waterproof garments.
    You may want an extra layer if the water is chilly, especially if
    you are surfing. They can also help prevent chafing and
    sunburn.![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_6.jpg")

### Covering Up and Creating Outfits

1.  Pick a cover-up dress for an effortless layering option. If you shop
    at a swimsuit or beach supply store, you’ll find dozens of cover-up
    options. Mostly all of the fabric comes in waterproof or
    quick-drying options, and you can pick a cover-up based on your
    personal
    preference.![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_7.jpg")
    -   For example, choose a mesh dress for a flirty touch or a bright
        color for a summertime style.
    -   Wear your cover-up on the way to the beach or while walking on
        the boardwalk, for instance.
2.  Dress in shorts and a tank top for a boho beach style. Throw on a
    tank top in a summery color like coral, aqua or lime green. Then,
    pair this with denim or cotton shorts for a laid-back, relaxed
    vibe.[6]![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_8.jpg")
    -   This is a great idea if you are shopping or grabbing lunch
        before soaking up some sun.
    -   For instance, pair a green shirt with cotton shorts with a
        pineapple motif.
3.  Choose a button-down or dress for a dressy beach look. If you want
    to make your beach outfit more formal, wear a floral or brightly
    colored button-down or maxi dress over your bathing suit. This works
    as a cover-up, and you can easily head right to the bar after you
    soak up some
    rays![7]![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_9.jpg")
    -   For instance, pick a dress with a tropical pattern, and wear
        this with a bright pink bathing suit. You can also go with a
        floral button-down and blue swimming trunks.
    -   You may want to dress a little nicer if you are relaxing at a
        tiki bar, for example.

### Adding Accessories

1.  Secure long hair with a scrunchy or headband so it is out of your
    face. Go with a [ponytail](Make-a-Ponytail "wikilink") or
    [bun](Make-a-Bun "wikilink") to protect your hair from the wind,
    sand, and waves. Rock a high ponytail to show off your beach waves,
    or try a low bun for an easy option. You can also style your hair in
    double buns, add a headband, or [braid](Braid-Hair "wikilink") the
    front section. With any style, you’ll be ready to catch the waves in
    no
    time.[8]![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Another flattering option includes the twisted side ponytail or
        half-up half-down styles,
    -   If you have short hair, you can wear it down, add a barrette, or
        use a headband.
2.  Wear flip-flops or sandals for a beach-appropriate footwear option.
    Choose flip-flops for an effortless option, or try a pair of strappy
    sandals to protect your feet from the hot
    sand.[9]![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_11.jpg")
    -   If your sandals strap to your feet and are waterproof, you can
        easily wear them in the ocean if you’d like.
    -   Alternatively, go with a wedge for a dressier style. However, it
        may be difficult to walk in sand, so save these for the
        boardwalk.
3.  Wear minimal jewelry so you don’t lose it at the beach. While you
    may want to feature your favorite necklace or bracelet with your
    summertime style, there’s a chance of losing it if you take it off
    to go in the water. Instead, leave your jewelry at home so your
    pieces can stay safe and
    sound.![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_12.jpg")
4.  Throw on a hat to protect you from the sun. A good sun hat is a
    beachgoers best friend. Wear a baseball cap or wide-brimmed hat to
    keep the sun out of your eyes while you relax on the
    shore.[10]![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_13.jpg")
5.  Put on sunglasses to keep the sun out of your eyes. Select a pair
    that protects from UV rays and are polarized, if possible. Go with a
    funky, oversized style for a fashionable option, or choose an
    aviator pair for a classic
    look.![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_14.jpg")
    -   It’s also helpful to bring a glasses case, so your lenses don’t
        get scratched inside your bag.

### Packing the Essentials

1.  Bring a beach bag to store your stuff. When you go to the beach, you
    don’t need to bring a nice, fancy purse or backpack with you. Bring
    something lightweight that you don’t mind getting a little sandy.
    Then, use this to house your beachwear, extra clothes, and
    sunglasses, for
    instance.[11]![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_15.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_15.jpg")
    -   For example, use a canvas tote or a waterproof bag.
2.  Don’t forget your sunscreen! Apply sunscreen 30 minutes before you
    get to the beach to ensure you are covered, then reapply the
    sunscreen every 2-6 hours as needed. If you feel your skin start to
    heat up, it’s a good idea to put more on. This way, you do not get
    sunburned.[12]![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_16.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_16.jpg")
    -   Use sunscreen with at least a 30 SPF at the minimum.
3.  Bring a blanket and umbrella so you can sunbathe comfortably. Lay a
    beach blanket out across the sand, and stick an umbrella into the
    ground nearby. Push down on the umbrella with moderate pressure so
    it stays in
    place.![](Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_17.jpg "fig:Dress_for_the_Beach_Step_17.jpg")
    -   You can arrange the blanket so it is half in the shade and half
        in the sun. Lay in the sun to get a tan and then roll under the
        shade whenever you need a break from the heat.
