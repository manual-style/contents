![](BeachCurls_Intro.jpg "fig:BeachCurls_Intro.jpg")Are you going to the
beach but don't know what to wear? Don't live near the beach but still
want to look like that's where you're heading?

## Steps

1.  ![](BeachAttire_Step_1.jpg "fig:BeachAttire_Step_1.jpg")Put your
    bathing suit on under your clothes. You should wear a sundress or
    shorts and a top to the beach. It really doesn't matter what kind of
    top, but stay away from long sleeves.
2.  ![](BeachFlipFlops_Step_2.jpg "fig:BeachFlipFlops_Step_2.jpg")Sandals
    or flip flops are best to wear to the beach because you can slip
    them on and off.
3.  ![](BeachCurls_Step_3.jpg "fig:BeachCurls_Step_3.jpg")When people
    talk about waves, they usually describe them as "beach waves". But
    honestly, not many people do their hair before going to the beach.
    Either keep it down or tie it in a ponytail.

## Tips

-   Make sure to wear sunblock!
-   Braiding your hair is also good. It's out of your eyes when you swim
    and curly when you take it out. Perfect for a day on the beach!
-   Sunglasses are also a good idea to keep the sun from shining in your
    eyes.
-   Waterproof mascara is a great way to brighten up your eyes.
-   Don't forget a towel to lay on.

## Warnings

-   Reapply sunscreen every 2 hours to avoid sunburn!
