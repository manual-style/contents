Soft relaxed waves,golden tan, perfect skin - who wouldn't want to look
like a beachy Cali girl? It's fairly easy and simple to achieve the
glowing look!

## Steps

1.  Braid your hair in two braids and just add the beach spray. It'll
    look like you've spent all day at the beach. If needed, you can add
    a couple of curls with a curling wand. This will give it a nice
    look.
2.  Try to be zit free with a good acne wash and treatment. Benzoyl
    peroxide and salicylic acid are the main acne fighting ingredients
    to look for. Overall the beach girl is very simple. A little
    concealer, mascara (water-proof mascara), dark brown eyeliner (less
    harsh than black and you only want to tightline your eyes), bronzer,
    and lip gloss can work.
3.  Wear light and airy clothing. Loose tees are essential. Short shorts
    are really in right now and they come in a wide variety of colors.
    Try white to accentuate that tan of yours. Flip flops and sandals
    are the perfect shoes for this look. The leather kinds are the best.
4.  Act the part. Smile at everyone, even strangers. Always be courteous
    and polite to others. Be active and join your school or towns
    sports.

## Tips

-   Carry a drink from Starbucks. Beachy girls always seem to have one.
-   Stay hydrated and drink at least 8 glasses of water a day.

## Warnings

-   If you're going for a tan look, be sun safe or you may get skin
    cancer.
-   Don't try too hard or you'll be seen as a wanna be.
-   Make sure your clothing fits your school dress code!
