When summer comes around, you want to feel and look gorgeous for your
long days at the beach. Getting ready for beach season can happen all
year long by implementing exercise and healthy diet into your daily
routine. Eating a diet high in protein, veggies, and healthy fats and
increasing cardio and strength activities will get your body lean and
toned, and learning what skin care routines and accessories make you
look and feel best will help you exude confidence at the beach.

## Steps

### Accessorizing To Fit Your Body Type

1.  Go shopping for a swimsuit that suits your shape. Every body type
    looks best in a different style of swimsuit. Whether you’ve got
    curves or a straighter waistline, purchasing a suit that flatters
    your figure is a guaranteed confidence
    builder.![](Look-Slim-in-a-Swimsuit-Step-1-Version-2.jpg "fig:Look-Slim-in-a-Swimsuit-Step-1-Version-2.jpg")
    -   For a big bust, opt for a halter-style bikini top with cups or
        inner support or a bra top with underwire support.
    -   For a tummy, try a tankini, especially A-line style tankinis. If
        you are worried about your hips/bum, boy leg shorts always look
        hot.
    -   For a small bust, find a top with ruffles, a bow or any textural
        embellishments to emphasize.
    -   Pastel colors suit paler skins, whereas bright colors look great
        on tanned or dark skin. Keep in mind you need to be confident in
        whatever swimsuit you're in!
2.  Wear a fun hat. Hats are both good sun protection and a fun beach
    accessory. If you’re feeling self-conscious about your body, hats
    help to draw the eye upward and bring more attention to your
    face.[1]![](Look-Slim-in-a-Swimsuit-Step-7.jpg "fig:Look-Slim-in-a-Swimsuit-Step-7.jpg")
3.  Paint your nails and toenails. Try out a bright summer color that
    will stand out, like yellow or orange. Getting a manicure and
    pedicure will make your nails pop, and also get rid of unwanted
    flaky skin on tricky spots like the bottoms of your feet, palms and
    cuticles.![](Create-a-Home-Spa-Treatment-With-Nail-Polish,-Jojoba-Oil-and-Apricot-Exfoliator-Step-8-Version-3.jpg "fig:Create-a-Home-Spa-Treatment-With-Nail-Polish,-Jojoba-Oil-and-Apricot-Exfoliator-Step-8-Version-3.jpg")
4.  Try out a new hairstyle. Between sun, ocean water, and sand, your
    hair is inevitably going to get messy at the beach. Why not prepare
    at home by giving yourself a cute hairstyle that lends itself to
    frizz and mess? Top knots and side braids are casual, cute, and
    naturally cut down on frizz and sun
    exposure.[2]![](Dye-Your-Hair-Multicolored-Step-15.jpg "fig:Dye-Your-Hair-Multicolored-Step-15.jpg")
    -   If your hair starts to feel dry after a few days at the beach,
        go heavy on the conditioner and purchase a leave-in cream with
        SPF.[3]
    -   For the adventurous, throw on a colorful headband or scarf to
        take your hairstyle to the next level.
5.  Bedazzle yourself. Jewelry at the beach is eye catching and makes
    you stand out. Wear a long, delicate necklace, a leather bracelet to
    class it up, and a pair of sunglasses that flatter your facial
    features.![](Look-Slim-in-a-Swimsuit-Step-8.jpg "fig:Look-Slim-in-a-Swimsuit-Step-8.jpg")
    -   Pick out a colorful beach bag with modern print to glamorize the
        process of lugging around towels and other beach necessities.
    -   Kaftans are chic and act as useful cover ups when the sun gets a
        little too overbearing.[4]
6.  Stand up straight and with confidence while on the beach. The best
    accessory anyone can have at the beach is confidence. Try practicing
    a few mindfulness exercises a day such as meditation or yoga to feel
    more comfortable and relaxed in your own skin. And don’t forget to
    smile and have a good time at the beach. If you act confident,
    you’ll feel
    confident!![](Act-Like-a-Rich-Daddy's-Girl-Step-5.jpg "fig:Act-Like-a-Rich-Daddy's-Girl-Step-5.jpg")

### Getting in Shape

1.  Develop a cardio routine. To look good at the beach it’s important
    to feel fit and toned, and cardio is a great way to burn extra
    calories. Working in about 45 minutes to an hour of cardio 4-6 days
    a week will help speed up your metabolism. Cardio also releases
    hormones that decrease stress and appetite and boost your overall
    positivity![5]![](Look-Slim-in-a-Swimsuit-Step-9.jpg "fig:Look-Slim-in-a-Swimsuit-Step-9.jpg")
    -   Be sure to pick an activity that you enjoy. Running, biking, and
        swimming are all fun cardio exercises for some, but if these
        aren’t for you, check to see if any zumba or spin classes are
        going on in your gym or neighborhood.
2.  Incorporate strength workouts. The best way to get that toned body
    you’ve always wanted is to start including strength based exercises
    into your weekly workout routine. Strength training increases lean
    muscle mass, reduces body fat, and burns calories. Aim to do
    strength exercises 2-4 times a week, depending on your level of
    fitness.[6]
    ![](Be-an-Elvish-Person-Step-14-Version-2.jpg "fig:Be-an-Elvish-Person-Step-14-Version-2.jpg")
    -   There are many ways to strength train. Lift weights, do yoga, do
        bodyweight exercises (push ups, pull ups, squats) – even
        ditching your car and walking back from the store with heavy
        groceries is a great strength activity![7]
    -   There’s a misconception that lifting heavy weights will make
        women too bulky. Straining your muscles is in fact the only way
        to get them the stronger – the unwanted bulk comes from eating
        too many calories. Next time you’re in the gym, ask a friend or
        trainer to show you how to do deadlifts, squats with weight, and
        kettlebell swings. These are both excellent workouts that will
        tone up your whole body.
3.  Work your core. Adding a substantial amount of core to your workout
    will help your abs ready for swimsuit season. Be sure to do a
    variety of high intensity workouts. Mountain climbers count as both
    cardio and abs, and holding side and front planks for 30-60 seconds
    will target your abs, back and
    shoulders.![](Take-Care-and-Manage-Curly-Hair-Step-8.jpg "fig:Take-Care-and-Manage-Curly-Hair-Step-8.jpg")
4.  Cut out carbs. Replacing unhealthy carbs such as sugar and starch
    (breads, pastas, pastries) with healthier alternatives reduces
    appetite, burns fat, and makes you feel and look more fit. Fill your
    diet with lots of lean protein (poultry, fish, legumes, and eggs)
    and as many vegetables as you’d like, and you’ll see and feel the
    results.[8]![](Look-Slim-in-a-Swimsuit-Step-10.jpg "fig:Look-Slim-in-a-Swimsuit-Step-10.jpg")
    -   Cutting carbs doesn’t mean completely eliminating them. The most
        important change you can make to your diet is getting rid of
        those processed foods that don’t provide your body with
        nutrients. Eating whole grains high in fiber such as oats, brown
        rice, farro, or quinoa in moderation will help you feel full and
        keep your diet balanced.
5.  Drink lots of water. Dehydration causes water retention, making you
    look unnecessarily bloated, puffy, and fatigued. Be sure to drink
    six-eight cups of water a day, and try cutting out diuretics (coffee
    and alcohol) a few days before you hit the beach to make your body
    as hydrated as
    possible.[9]![](Have-Clean-and-Natural-Skin-Step-9.jpg "fig:Have-Clean-and-Natural-Skin-Step-9.jpg")

### Revitalizing Your Appearance

1.  Give your body a full exfoliation. Exfoliating your skin removes
    flakiness and gives you a healthy glow. Try an exfoliating body
    scrub in the shower and a deep pore cleansing clay mask for your
    face and neck. Be sure to
    moisturize!![](Bathe-Safely-With-Newly-Pierced-Ears_Cartilage-Step-13.jpg "fig:Bathe-Safely-With-Newly-Pierced-Ears_Cartilage-Step-13.jpg")
    -   If you don’t have a body scrub, try mixing brown sugar with any
        body lotion for a homemade exfoliant. Apply to your skin in a
        circular motion and then rinse off in a warm shower.[10]
    -   Be sure to exfoliate 24 hours before the beach to give your body
        time to recover from potential inflammation.[11]
2.  Make sure to remove all unwanted body hair. Getting a wax or shaving
    at home will eliminate body hair to get you looking great in a
    bikini. If shaving at home, be sure to lather up on shaving cream
    and use a good, 3-4-blade razor to avoid unsightly cuts or razor
    burn.![](Find-Swimwear-for-DD-Cup-Step-2.jpg "fig:Find-Swimwear-for-DD-Cup-Step-2.jpg")
    -   For those opting for a wax, be sure to book an appointment a few
        days before you hit the beach to give inflammation time to heal.
3.  Apply sunscreen of at least 30 SPF. Use sunscreen all over your body
    and face to avoid a burn. Sun damage also can cause wrinkles, so
    it’s important to lather up even if you’re working on a tan. Look
    for moisturizers, make up, and lip balm with a little added SPF to
    get some extra
    protection.![](Achieve-Lighter-and-Spot-Free-Skin-Step-12-Version-2.jpg "fig:Achieve-Lighter-and-Spot-Free-Skin-Step-12-Version-2.jpg")
4.  Get rid of body acne. Sweat and dirt in your pores can easily turn
    into unwanted pimples and blackheads. If you struggle from body or
    facial acne, use a body wash that contains salicylic acid to
    maintain blemish free
    skin.[12]![](Get-Rid-of-Acne-Fast-with-Honey-Step-6.jpg "fig:Get-Rid-of-Acne-Fast-with-Honey-Step-6.jpg")
5.  Apply a self-tanner for a bronzed, beach babe look. This should be
    applied after you moisturize. It usually takes between 5-7 days for
    skin to peak, so plan accordingly.[13] There’s no need to use a
    self-tanner, but many find it boosts confidence in the early beach
    season when skin is still lighter from winter. Remember, pale skin
    is beautiful
    too!![](Be-Visual-Kei-Step-4-Version-2.jpg "fig:Be-Visual-Kei-Step-4-Version-2.jpg")

##

-   Make sure all makeup is waterproof.
-   For a natural beauty therapy whilst at the beach, you can give your
    body an exfoliation with sand and rinse with pure ocean water.
-   Spray an anti-frizz treatment in your hair and then leave au
    natural. Low maintenance should be the main aim at the beach.
-   Be sure to apply sunblock regularly to avoid sunburn. It is always
    better to be pale than sunburnt!
-   For a more subtle tan, mix self-tanner with your moisturizer for a
    lighter radiance.
-   Get six to eight hours of sleep per night to boost your metabolism
    and feel fresh at the beach.
-   Smile and be confident. You will look a million times better if you
    are happy with yourself!

## Warnings

-   Don't forget to maintain a weekly exercise regimen and a healthy
    eating plan to make sure you look great in your bikini!
-   Don't forget to have a shower before you head for the beach...[body
    odor](Eliminate_Body_Odor "wikilink") on a hot summer day is a real
    turn-off.
-   Exfoliants can fade or even streak your tan, so be careful.
-   Exfoliating and rinsing with ocean water can in turn make the skin
    more susceptible to dryness and the bacteria and microorganisms that
    populate both the sand and ocean water. Be sure to use lotion and
    antibacterial soap on your feet and the rest of your body once you
    get home.
-   Shave *before* you use self-tanner or it will come off in the places
    that you shaved.
