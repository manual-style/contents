Who doesn't want to feel/look cute and hot in the summer? Everybody,
right? By the end of this article, you are ready to go!

## Steps

1.  Wear sunglasses. You always need to wear sunglasses. Go for one that
    fits your face shape. If you have a face that is more round, go for
    glasses that have edges, like a square. The other way around if you
    have an edgy
    face.![](Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Your make-up. So you wanna look as sun-kissed as possible, and you
    do it by keeping your make-up natural. Start with moisturizing your
    skin in the morning, and then put on very little concealer that
    matches your skin tone. Also, make sure your blush is light and
    blended in with your skin. Put a maybe light color eyeshadow on your
    eyelids that match the color of your eyes.

3.  Green eyes goes with a soft pink wine color or
    brown.![](Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Blue eyes go beautifully with
    brown.![](Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Hazel eyes are a beautiful when done with purple and
    pink.![](Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_5.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Brown eyes: You can pretty much do every color on this one.

7.  Gray eyes are beautiful with black, but you can also go with
    pink.![](Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_7.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Lips. Now when it comes to lips, you wanna have a cute color, and
    not a fierce red. Go for peach or rosy lip
    gloss.![](Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_8.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_8.jpg")
9.  The lashes. This is a part that is often forgotten. You need at
    least two coats of waterproof mascara if you are planning to swim.
    Do it from root to top, and while applying it, do it in a zigzag
    way, since this will make it look fuller and
    longer.![](Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_9.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_9.jpg")
10. Tops. I personally would advise a strapless if you wear strapless
    bikini's, or else you can see the non - tanned stripes, which looks
    kind of not done. Button ups are cute, and so are spaghetti
    tops.![](Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_10.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_10.jpg")
11. The bottom. Okay, so you don't want to go to the beach with skinny
    jeans, because A: they are a Don't on the beach, and B: they are
    very hard to get the sand out off. So don't wear them. Wear short
    boyfriend jeans or a cute white skirt. For a real beach outfit, I
    would wear a red strapless top with a short white skirt and sandals.
    Wear some hoops, but don't make the jewelry to
    overdone.![](Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_11.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_11.jpg")
12. Shoes. Or lets just say sandals or flip flops. Never wear heels in
    the sand. Never, ever do that. You will not be able to walk, and it
    isn't sexy to see you trying to go forward with a red
    head.![](Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_12.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_12.jpg")
13. Flirt. Smile and wave, always works. When you know him. When you see
    a guy that you don't know, but do want to get to know, look down
    when he is about to pass you, and look up to him. When you look up,
    your eyes look bigger. Brush your hair out of your face, sit at the
    beach or at the side of the pool with your feet dangling in the
    water, which is absolutely cute and
    irresistible.![](Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_13.jpg "fig:Look_Cute_at_the_Beach_Step_13.jpg")

## Tips

-   Don't overdo the flirting. Please, don't. If he shows no interest,
    don't try to get it, because he will only think you are a prep who
    needs him to occupy herself.
-   Did you know that many guys think girls that smile are cuter?
-   Don't sit on the beach with your oversized sunglasses and a book if
    you are looking for guys. You will make a brick wall around you if
    you do it like that. Just go to the beach with a couple of friends,
    and smile.
