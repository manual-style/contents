What’s better than spending a day at the beach, relaxing in the sun, and
dipping into the warm water? Looking good while you do it, of course!
[Choose a swimsuit](Choose_a_Swimsuit "wikilink") that accentuates your
body’s beauty and spend some time prepping your skin for the sun before
heading out to the beach.

## Steps

### Choosing a Swimsuit

1.  Choose a suit with wide straps and underwire if you are apple
    shaped. Look for suits that will provide enough support for your
    bust so you’ll be comfortable and fashionable while you’re at the
    beach. Opt for a suit with thick straps rather than string ties or
    no straps at all. Try to find a suit that has details at the waist
    line for added
    definition.[1]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_1_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_1_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   Also look for high-cut legs if you are apple shaped to help
        accentuate your legs and lengthen your body.
2.  Highlight your waist and curves if you have an hourglass shaped
    body. Make sure to choose a suit that has enough underwire or bust
    support if you need, and choose a suit that accentuates your waist
    to draw attention to your curvy, proportional
    figure.[2]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_2_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_2_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   Skirted suits also look nice on the hourglass shaped body, as do
        suits with belts.
3.  Buy a solid-colored or vertically striped suit if you are petite.
    Choose a sporty one-piece suit to elongate your body. Vertical
    stripes will also create the illusion of elongating your torso. Look
    for suits that have high-cut legs to make your legs appear
    longer.[3]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_3_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_3_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   Being “petite” generally means that you are 5’2” or under and
        that you have a smaller framed body.
4.  Wear a color or pattern blocked suit if you are pear shaped. Look
    for a suit with a solid colored bottom and a brightly colored or
    patterned top. This will draw the eye up and will create a more
    balanced look between your shapely waist and your
    top.[4]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_4_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_4_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   You could even get a two piece suit and mix and match the tops
        and bottoms to create different beach outfits. Focus on black or
        navy blue bottoms and then have fun choosing differently
        patterned tops!
5.  Get a suit that creates curves if you are rectangular in shape.
    Choose suits with asymmetrical straps, ruffled tops, ruched
    waistlines, and horizontal stripes. These details will draw the eye
    and create the illusion of curves and will make your body look
    softer.[5]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_5_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_5_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   Being rectangular in shape means that your body isn’t very curvy
        because your hips and waist are about the same size.
    -   Boy shorts also look good on people with a rectangular body
        shape.

### Picking out Swim Shorts

1.  Get short to mid-length shorts without long drawstrings if you are
    short. Avoid choosing shorts that are baggy or wide in the legs or
    ones that extend past your mid-thigh area. Longer shorts on shorter
    legs can make you look shorter than you actually are, as can long
    drawstrings.[6]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_6_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_6_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   If you do find shorts you like but that have long drawstrings,
        try tying a bigger knot with them or even tucking them inside
        your shorts to keep them out of the way.
2.  Choose longer shorts with a drawstring if you have a larger belly.
    Pick shorts that come below your mid-thigh or down to your knees to
    help elongate your body and pull attention away from your belly.
    Invest in shorts with a drawstring rather than ones with an elastic
    waist so you can adjust the waistband to fit more
    comfortably.[7]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_7_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_7_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   Avoid any shorts labeled “tailored” or “tapered.”
3.  Look for shorts that have wide legs if you have thick quads. Stay
    away from tailored or tapered shorts and choose ones that have
    either drawstrings or a relaxed elastic band. Board shorts are good
    options if you have wider legs as they tend to be roomier all the
    way through the
    legs.[8]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_8_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_8_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   As far as length goes, feel free to wear short to mid to long
        shorts—whichever you feel the most comfortable in.
4.  Buy short swim trunks if you are tall and lean. Accentuate your long
    legs and your torso by wearing shorter trunks when you’re at the
    beach. Try to choose a suit that has a pattern to provide some
    contrast from your body, and opt for a pair with drawstrings so you
    can adjust the waistband
    easily.[9]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_9_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_9_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   Look for a inseam for your shorts.

### Taking Care of Your Skin

1.  [Exfoliate](Exfoliate_Your_Body_for_Soft_Skin "wikilink") your skin
    for a healthy glow. A few weeks before you start hitting the beach,
    add exfoliating into your skincare routine. When exfoliating, use a
    gentle, circular motion to slough off dead skin from your feet to
    your legs, and all the way up to your
    shoulders.[10]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_10_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_10_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   Hydrating and exfoliating will help brighten your skin before
        you head off into the sun.
2.  Take care of body hair by [shaving](Shave_Your_Legs "wikilink"),
    trimming, and [waxing](Wax "wikilink"). Remove unwanted hair from
    your legs, armpits, and bikini area. You can shave these areas
    yourself, or book a waxing appointment. Try to shave, trim, or wax 2
    to 3 days before you go to the beach so your skin will have time to
    heal from any
    irritation.[11]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_11_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_11_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   After you shave, apply a moisturizing lotion to reduce
        irritation and the chance of pesky ingrown hairs appearing.
3.  Apply [self-tanner](Apply_Self-Tanner "wikilink") or get a [spray
    tan](Get_a_Good_Spray_Tan "wikilink") to combat pasty skin. If you
    have pale skin or an uneven skin tone, invest in a good self-tanning
    lotion or oil or schedule an appointment for a spray-tan. When
    applying self-tanner, make sure to follow the instructions on the
    bottle for the best results. If you’re getting a spray-tan, schedule
    your appointment for several days before your first beach
    trip.[12]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_12_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_12_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   Exfoliating before apply self-tanner helps remove dead skin and
        makes the application more even.
    -   Some well-reviewed self-tanners are: Tan-Luxe Wonder Oil,
        Sephora tinted self-tanning body mist, Banana Boat summer color
        self-tanning lotion, and the TanTowel to-go kit.
4.  [Moisturize your skin](Moisturize_Your_Skin "wikilink") to get rid
    of flaky, dry patches. During the weeks preceding your beach trip,
    take a few minutes to apply moisturizing lotion to your entire body
    after each shower. Don’t forget to moisturize your feet, elbows, and
    knees,
    too!![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_13_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_13_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   Visit your local drugstore or go to a salon to check out
        different moisturizers. Look up reviews online if you’re
        uncertain of which lotions are the best.
    -   Don’t forget to stay hydrated! Getting enough water helps
        hydrate your skin and keeps it looking healthy.
5.  Treat cellulite through exercise and special lotions. Invest in a
    cellulite-reducing lotion 4-6 weeks before beach season, and apply
    it regularly after you shower. You can also start doing some
    [targeted body-weight
    exercises](Get_Rid_of_Cellulite_With_Exercise "wikilink") to help
    tone up the affected
    areas.[13]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_14_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_14_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   For body-weight exercises, implement them about 4 weeks before
        summertime and repeat them every other day for maximum results.
6.  [Hide spider veins](Hide_Leg_Veins "wikilink") with waterproof
    concealer. Apply a yellow or orange waterproof concealer overtop of
    spider veins to mask their appearance. Try to apply this before
    heading to the beach so it has time to dry. For a more permanent
    solution, you could even look into getting sclerotherapy done, which
    is an injection which helps clear up spider
    veins.[14]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_15_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_15_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   After applying the concealer, check to make sure the makeup is
        blending in with the rest of your skin and that there are no
        obvious makeup lines.
7.  Use cocoa butter to help reduce stretch marks. Apply cocoa butter or
    other topical oils to your stomach, sides, legs, and arms as needed
    after you shower. Make sure to stay hydrated, too, as water will
    help your skin heal. You can also apply waterproof makeup to your
    stretch marks before heading to the
    beach.[15]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_16_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_16_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   Keep in mind that most people have stretch marks, whether just
        from growing, exercising, having children, or gaining weight. If
        you do have them, know you won’t be the only person at the beach
        with them!
8.  Choose [natural looking
    makeup](Apply_Makeup_for_a_Natural_Look "wikilink"), or go barefaced
    to the beach. Apply a tinted moisturizer with SPF to your face the
    morning before you go to the beach. The sun is good for your skin
    and can help clear up acne, too, so you don’t want to cover it up
    too much with concealer or foundation. If you regularly do your
    [eyebrows](Fill_in_Eyebrows "wikilink"), go ahead and still apply
    them before going to the beach to help you look fresh and
    awake.[16]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_17_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_17_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   If you do want to wear eyeshadow and mascara, look for
        waterproof options so you don’t have to worry about your making
        getting smeared if you go into the water.
    -   If you’re worried about your skin getting too shiny while you’re
        out, apply some powder to your t-zone.
9.  Remember to [apply sunscreen](Apply_Sunscreen "wikilink") before and
    during your trip. Apply a thick layer of sunscreen to your face and
    any area of your body that will be exposed to the sun. Start
    applying the sunscreen at least 20 minutes before you’re actually
    going to be in the sun for maximum protection. Refresh your
    sunscreen every 90 minutes, or sooner, if you go into the water and
    aren’t using waterproof
    sunscreen.[17]![](Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_18_Version_2.jpeg "fig:Look_Good_at_the_Beach_Step_18_Version_2.jpeg")
    -   When purchasing sunscreen, look for a broad-spectrum lotion or
        spray that protects against UV-A and UV-B rays. At a minimum,
        get SPF 15, though if you can, SPF 30 or 45 is recommended.

## Tips

-   Dressing for your body shape can help you feel more comfortable
    while you’re at the beach, but remember, in the end it’s most
    important that you like and feel good in what you’re wearing! If
    that is something different than what the style guides suggest, that
    is okay!
-   Consider getting a manicure and pedicure or [doing one at
    home](Give_Yourself_a_Manicure "wikilink") before heading to the
    beach.
-   Invest in some fun beach accessories like a sunhat, a swimsuit
    coverup, sunglasses, and fun sandals to help you look good at the
    beach.
