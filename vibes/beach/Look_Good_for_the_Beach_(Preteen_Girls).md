Are you a preteen girl? You see all these teenagers walking around in
they're super hot bikinis and you wonder 'How can I look that pretty as
a kid?' Easy. Read this article to continue.

## Steps

1.  Act your age. Don't act older. There's time until you become a
    teenager, so act your own age and wear appropriate
    clothing.![](Look_Good_for_the_Beach_(Preteen_Girls)_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Good_for_the_Beach_(Preteen_Girls)_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Have a healthy body. If possible, start exercising 2-3 months before
    the summer. Drink lots of water for smooth soft skin. You're too
    young to wax/shave so just have a tan if that is natural for your
    skin. Go for a fun glowing skin look by moisturizing and washing
    your face everyday for about 3-4 weeks before the summer. Please be
    happy with your body type, though. Do NOT starve yourself to make
    your stomach flat. There is no mold for a "nice
    body."![](Look_Good_for_the_Beach_(Preteen_Girls)_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Good_for_the_Beach_(Preteen_Girls)_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Go shopping with friends or your mom. Buy some nice summer clothes
    and a bikini, bag, hat and swimming top to match. If you prefer a
    one-piece suit, that's fine. Modest is hottest, so wear what you
    feel most comfortable
    in.![](Look_Good_for_the_Beach_(Preteen_Girls)_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Good_for_the_Beach_(Preteen_Girls)_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Baggy tops. Wear your bikini under a baggy top. You can buy them in
    many shops. Try for a see-through baggy top so every one can see you
    pretty

5.  Prove it. Prove that you came to the beach to have fun. A smile is
    the best accessory anybody can have. So laugh, jump and swim with
    confidence.![](Be_an_Average_Teen_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_an_Average_Teen_Step_6.jpg")

    like.Be yourself and have
