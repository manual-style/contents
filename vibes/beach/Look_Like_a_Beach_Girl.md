### Clothing

1.  Choose an outfit. There are different styles of clothing to wear.

    you:![](Wear_a_Beach_Coverup_Step_9.jpg "fig:Wear_a_Beach_Coverup_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Option #1: Bikini bottom and top with see through skirt,
        sunglasses, and flipflops or sandals (optional- straw hat or
        beach hat).
    -   Option #2: Daisy duke, bikini on top, sunglasses, bare foot, and
        shimmer lotion.
    -   Option #3: A bikini- bottom and top.
    -   Option #4: Super loose open back shirt or sweatshirt, jean
        shorts (with thin fashionable belt), and bikini under.
2.  Wear cover when going to the beach. If you live near a beach, you
    might consider wearing your bikini top under your regular shirt and
    letting the straps show. Otherwise classic attire would be Bermuda
    shorts, graphic T's, bright colors (such as turquoise, hot pink, and
    yellow) and flip-flops.

1.  Choose a style that suits you. Consider the
    following:![](Braid-African-American-Hair-Step-15.jpg "fig:Braid-African-American-Hair-Step-15.jpg")
    -   Classic loose and messy french braid or regular braid.
    -   Messy top knot bun (with sunglasses).
    -   Loose beach waves with your hair out and free.
2.  Get some blond streaks. You don't need to have blond hair to look
    like a California beach girl. Use Sun-In or lemon juice to put in
    your hair before you go outside; this will gradually help lighten
    your hair. This is fine for goes for blonds and brunettes. You can
    do it all over or in streaks. Red hair and darker hair is fine too,
    the beach doesn't
    discriminate.![](Balayage-Step-6.jpg "fig:Balayage-Step-6.jpg")

### Fixing Your Face

1.  Go for the natural look. If you have dark makeup on or bright blond
    hair when three days ago you had brown hair, it does *not* look
    natural. Stay true to your hair color. If you are accustomed to
    wearing dark make-up, like a lot of Cali beach girls, then be sure
    to purchase it in
    waterproof.![](Apply-Makeup-for-a-Beauty-Pageant-Step-23.jpg "fig:Apply-Makeup-for-a-Beauty-Pageant-Step-23.jpg")
2.  Apply a small amount of blush to the apples of your cheeks to give
    you a flushed look. Add some chap-stick, a coat of clear/light pink
    lip gloss, and a small amount of black eyeliner (optional). Keep it
    looking clean, so go easy on the
    eyeliner.![](Apply-Makeup-for-a-Beauty-Pageant-Step-10.jpg "fig:Apply-Makeup-for-a-Beauty-Pageant-Step-10.jpg")
3.  Take care of your teeth. Brush them at least twice a day, and make
    them look naturally white (remember to smile). Floss daily, use
    mouthwash, and carry around mints for fresh breath.Take care of your
    skin. Wear lots of sunscreen whenever you go outside. Exfoliate and
    wash your face regularly. If you can, get a natural tan or at least
    make it *look* natural. Keeping your skin acne free is also a
    necessity.![](Clean_Your_Teeth_After_Wisdom_Teeth_Removal_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Clean_Your_Teeth_After_Wisdom_Teeth_Removal_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")

### Enjoying Being a Beach Girl

1.  Get out there and enjoy the beach activities. Don't be so caught up
    in how you look that you fail to enjoy the activities on offer, from
    swimming and building sandcastles to boating and rescuing stragglers
    in the
    ocean.![](Go_Boating_With_Your_Dog_Step_2.jpg "fig:Go_Boating_With_Your_Dog_Step_2.jpg")

    life to the
    fullest!![](Be_Girly_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Girly_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
