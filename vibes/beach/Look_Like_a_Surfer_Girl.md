The surfer girl look can be fun for a costume or just a style to adopt
if you live in a sunny area. If you want to look like a surfer girl, you
will need beach style clothing like shorts and a jumper dress. You can
also accessorize with things like sunglasses. Opt for minimal makeup and
hair that looks a little wet.

## Steps

### Selecting Clothing

1.  Try using a bikini top as a shirt. A bikini top may seem like an
    unconventional item to wear as clothing, but you can find a way to
    make one work as a shirt. You do not have to wear a real swimsuit,
    but go for something like a tube tank-top or crop top with a
    bikini-like
    feel.[1]![](Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_1_Version_4.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_1_Version_4.jpg")
    -   This can be paired with high wasted shorts or a nice jacket.
2.  Invest in a solid pair of shorts. Shorts are a staple of the surfer
    girl style. You should have at least a few pairs of shorts in your
    wardrobe if you want to look like a surfer
    girl.[2]![](Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
    -   The surfer girl is meant to be laid back. Therefore, you should
        look for shorts that do not look new or expensive.
    -   Stop by a local thrift store. You are bound to find a few pairs
        of shorts there that work with the surfer girl style.
3.  Have a knit jumper for cooler weather. A jumper dress looks
    something like a pair of overalls. You should opt for one if you
    want to adopt the surfer girl style. It works well because surfer
    girls are often hopping in and out of the ocean and may throw on a
    light dress to pop into a store before returning to the beach. Go
    for a knit dress, as this gives you a lot of exposure to
    air.[3]![](Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   You should search thrift stores for a jumper dress, as clothing
        that looks worn adds to the laid back surfer mentality.
4.  Wear sandals or wedges. Sandals and wedges should be a staple of
    your wardrobe if you want to look like a surfer girl. Invest in a
    variety of bright, colorful pairs of these types of
    shoes.[4]![](Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   You can also go for flip-flips for the surfer girl feel.
5.  Wear plaid. As the surfer girl culture is sometimes thought of as
    somewhat tomboyish, plaid should be a staple in your wardrobe. Opt
    for plaid button down shirts, which can easily be worn over a
    tank-top or
    bikini-top.[5]![](Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")

### Picking Accessories

1.  Wear sunglasses. If you want to look like a surfer girl, sunglasses
    are a must have. You should have several pairs of sunglasses of
    different colors and styles for a variety of
    outfits.[6]![](Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_6_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_6_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Keep in mind, the surfer girl culture is not overly concerned
        with materialism. Designer sunglasses may not mesh as well with
        the surfer girl look.
2.  Try a trucker hat. The surfer girl look is a little tom boyish by
    nature, so a trucker hat can help solidify the look. If you wear
    your hair in a mermaid braid, a trucker hat can fit in nicely with
    your
    style.[7]![](Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you're not a fan of trucker hats, you could wear something
        like a baseball hat instead.
3.  Invest in a waterproof watch. A waterproof watch can give you a
    surfer girl vibe, as it has a kind of casual, tomboyish appeal. It
    also reflects the fact that, as a surfer, you spend a lot of your
    time in the
    water.[8]![](Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Carry a beach or tote bag. As a surfer girl, a typical purse may
    seem a little too fancy. Opt for something more casual, like a beach
    bag or a tote bag, to carry your things. This can help you look like
    a relaxed surfer
    girl.![](Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")

### Styling Your Hair and Makeup

1.  Use sea salt spray to create a wet look. Surfer girls often have
    wet, wavy hair. To achieve this, mist your hair with a matte hair
    spray to get it a little damp. From there, douse your hair in some
    sea salt spray. Then, you can use your fingers to bunch your hair to
    create messy
    waves.[9]![](Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If your hair is already damp, just use the sea salt spray.
    -   You should avoid using sea salt spray, however, if you were
        actually at the beach, as too much salt could damage your hair.
2.  Braid your hair. A long braid can give your hair a mermaid vibe. If
    you have longer braid, try braiding it into a single long braid that
    hangs over your shoulder. This is a great look to pair with
    hats.[10]![](Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Use bronzer. You want the sun-kissed look of someone who spends a
    lot of time on the beach. Bronzer can help you achieve this. You can
    dust your face with a layer of bronzer to give yourself a believable
    tan.[11]![](Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you actually do spend a lot of time on the beach, use
        sunscreen under your bronzer and choose a bronzer with SPF
        protection.
4.  Opt for neutral tones with makeup. Surfer girls spend a lot of time
    in water. Therefore, elaborate makeup isn't exactly realistic.
    Neutral tones that match your natural skin work
    best.[12]![](Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Surfer_Girl_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you use foundation, use only a light amount that matches your
        skin.
    -   Stick to neutral tones of eye shadow and lipstick, if you use
        them at all.
    -   Minimize your use of things like eye liner or mascara. If
        they're used, use them very lightly.
