Do you ever feel like dressing like you are a swimmer, whether you swim
for fun or competitively? This article will provide steps to help you
look like a swimmer.

## Steps

1.  Do your hair in a way that is easy for you. For example, you could
    have your hair in a loose bun. This makes it easier to stuff into a
    cap, If your hair is short, you can pull it half up with a clip like
    Christine M. does. Hair is something that you can have fun with, so
    try out new
    things!![](Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Keep makeup to a minimum. A little mascara and a touch of shadow is
    alright to wear! Big heavy makeup is not recommended because the
    water will cause it to smear. Lip balm is recommended, as it is
    perfect for when you are on the
    go.![](Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Be prepared to shave, and to shave often. Shaving is a must for a
    swimmer. Some coaches like you to shave rarely so that when you
    shave for the big meet you will really "feel" the water. In
    consideration, some girls don't like to do that, especially since
    the suit shows all! Before a big meet, a recommend saving the
    shaves, but a must is a must, so its alright to shave
    often!![](Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Be prepared to shop! Clothes are great to show style, especially for
    swimmers! At meets they sell shirts and sweatshirts, and wearing
    those to school are great! Also, wearing shirts from Kiefer, Swim
    Outlet, etc. are great as well. Most swimmers like to be
    comfortable, so PINK (from Victoria's Secret) items are great as
    well. Style sense is up to you, but make sure to wear some things
    with swimming
    spirit!![](Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Get the right kind of footwear. Flip flops are a must in the
    swimming world! If you are young, Crocs are perfect. Also, many
    girls enjoy Uggs after swim practice at night in the winter. It
    always is nice to feel the fur on your feet when you are cold. Gym
    shoes are a must for working out. Try New Balance, Nike, and
    Adidas.![](Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_5.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Wear the suit that works for you. For suits, many swimmers enjoy
    Speedos, Dolphin Uglies and TYR suits. For competition you can buy a
    tech. suit, but that is optional, and good for big Christmas
    present!![](Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_6.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Attitude, Swimmers are very laid back people, but they make great
    friends. Don't be afraid to just be yourself and go with the
    flow.![](Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_7.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Swimmer_Step_7.jpg")
