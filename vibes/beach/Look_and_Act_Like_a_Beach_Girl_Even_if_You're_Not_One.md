Want to look and act like a beach girl? Even if you don't have a beach
in your area, this article will teach you how. In the article you can
learn to be one at little or no cost!

## Steps

1.  Wear Summer styled clothing, but don't change your personal style to
    fit the look.Wear things that say California, beach & summer but not
    everyday, or else people will see right through you and remember to
    dress for the weather. Wearing perfume for fragrances that smell
    good is great! Perhaps try a beachy scent including notes like
    coconut, tropical fruit, summer flowers, Try flip flops, sandals, or
    slip on sneakers instead of high top sneakers, boots and shoes with
    heavy fabric. Try leather or faux leather shoes, worn or distressed
    fabric and light thin fabric sneakers and warm or neutral colours

2.  Beach waves can be very summery Try braiding your hair overnight for
    beachy waves Natural hair styles and simple loose styles like messy
    buns, simple braids or even a plain ponytail give a great beach
    look.

3.  Smiling and laughing is a great way to look like you're always
    having fun. Don't laugh at people, laugh at yourself. Tell a joke if
    you need to, it's an excuse to laugh. And if you are trying to
    impress someone, smile and them and hold their gaze. Try it with
    strangers first, or even your family. Then use it a school.

4.  Last but not least, lets state the obvious. Go to the beach! If you
    don't live near the beach you could take swimming lessons, take
    beach holidays or volunteer to work at an animal rescue with fish
    and other aquatic animals if there is one in your area.
