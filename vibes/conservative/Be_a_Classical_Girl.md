Has mom tried convincing you to be a bit more like a lady? Consider it
as advice or something new to try. Who knows? This could be a whole new
you! Here are the steps if you're interested!

## Steps

1.  Act like a lady, you're not little
    anymore.![](Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_1.jpg")
    -   Take etiquette classes, read etiquette books, or even learn
        etiquette online. Any lady knows the proper way to act in every
        situation.
    -   Mind basic manners, such as not laughing or talking when eating,
        saying "Please" and "Thank you", and respecting elders.
2.  Practice good
    posture.![](Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_3.jpg")
    -   Sit straight up, put your legs and your hands down. Keep feet
        flat on the ground, or you may cross them at the ankles.
    -   Stand with your head, shoulders, hips, and ankles in a straight
        line. Imagine a string pulling your body straight up. When
        walking, cross one leg slightly in front of the other as if
        walking on a line.
3.  Speak like a
    lady.![](Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_4.jpg")
    -   Do not speak loudly, it can be considered rude. Speak at an
        audibly, but not excessively loud. Enunciate and exude
        confidence with your words.
    -   Improve your vocabulary. This shows you are educated. Learn new
        words every day and actively use them when you speak. Also be
        sure to practice proper grammar and spelling.
4.  Never run! Walk at a comfortable pace, taking small steps instead of
    wide ones and walking as if gliding through the
    air.![](Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_5.jpg")
5.  Be friendly to everyone around you, always smile, have a nice
    attitude and never
    cuss.![](Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_6.jpg")
    -   If you do not like someone, remain civil and courteous to them
        and treat them with respect, but do not act as if you are
        friends with them.
    -   Remember that there is a reason behind the things people do. For
        example, if you do not like a girl because she is an "attention
        seeker", keep in mind that her attention seeking behavior may be
        due to the fact that she might have been bullied or ignored in
        the past.
6.  Dress like a lady. Dress modestly and femininely. Wear colors such
    as light pinks, creams, white, black, dark reds, mauve, navy,
    purples, and grays. Floral prints are also great options. Cotton,
    satin, velvety and sheer materials make you appear ladylike.
    -   Wear skirts. The best lengths are from mini to knee length.
        Pleated, A-line, circle, and pencil skirts are recommended.
    -   Wear sweaters. Cardigans and pullovers are classic, and look
        great with collared shirts underneath. Turtlenecks are a great
        choice for colder weather. You can also wear pea coats, blazers,
        fake leather jackets, or other chic outerwear to keep you warm.
    -   Accessories can add a special touch to an outfit. A bag to carry
        your things is important. For school, choose a backpack with
        good support to keep from hurting your back. A simple cross-body
        bag can keep your important things near you at all times. A
        pearl necklace or a simple silver or gold chain looks
        elegant.![](Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_7.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_7.jpg")
7.  Shoes can make or break an outfit. It's recommended to have at least
    three basic pairs: one for sports or active wear, one for school or
    work, and one for special events.
    -   Sports shoes should be a good quality. They should be
        breathable.
    -   Black or white shoes match almost any outfit.
    -   Try not to wear heels very often. They are bad for your health.
        If you do decide to wear them, keep them 4 inches or under.
8.  Wear your hair anyway you like. Always condition it, and try to
    avoid heat styling or using many alcohol filled or drying products,
    as these things can damage your hair. Keep it natural colors, and if
    you choose to dye it, dye it black, brown, blonde, or a natural
    shade of red. You can also highlight it. Comb with a wide toothed
    comb when it is wet, and if you have curly or wavy hair, do not
    brush it when it is dry or it will become frizzy. Avoid perms and
    relaxers.![](Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_8.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_8.jpg")
    -   If you want wavy hair without heat, put it into to two side
        braids or two french braids before you sleep.
    -   If you have frizzy hair, put a leave-in conditioner or serum
        into you hair and put it into a ponytail or bun before you
        sleep.
    -   If you have afro-textured hair, wear protective hairstyles or
        let your hair be natural. Some examples of protective styles are
        cornrows, twists, and braids.
9.  Keep makeup appearing natural. Some concealer under the eyes and on
    blemishes should be enough skin coverage for most girls. If you do
    need more coverage, wear a BB cream. Blend it into the neck to avoid
    a visible difference where your face ends. If you'd like to keep
    skin matte, use translucent powder.
    -   Eyeliner should be pencil and look as if it is barely there. If
        you decide to apply makeup to your eyebrows, use a pencil or
        powder and make it look natural by using little product. Lip
        balm or gloss keeps lips
        hydrated.![](Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_9.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_9.jpg")
10. Stay healthy. Eat well and eat good portions. You can find out how
    many calories you need in a day online. Try to eat that many
    calories to maintain your weight. Do not go on starvation diets.
    Exercise 60 minutes a day with cardio and strength training. Don't
    smoke, drink, or do drugs.
    -   Don't forget your mental health. If you are dealing with a
        difficult situation or are not feeling well, talk to a parent,
        counselor, or other trusted adult. Develop healthy coping
        methods, and do your best to refrain from engaging in harmful
        behavior such as cutting, isolating yourself, or self
        starvation.
11. Groom yourself well. Keep facial hair away with plucking or waxing.
    Shave, use a hair removal cream, or wax body hair. Daily showers are
    a must.
    -   Take care of your skin. Wash with a gentle cleanser made for
        your face. If you have acne, use one with salicylic acid. More
        aggressive acne can be treated with adapalene. Use a toner after
        washing, the a moisturizer, serum, or ampule. You can also layer
        these products. Exfoliate two to three times a week. Use
        hydrating or detoxifying masks. Don't forget to exfoliate and
        moisturize the skin on your body as well.
    -   Keep nails trimmed and clean. You can paint them simple colors
        or have cool designs. It's better to have short nails as they
        are less likely to break and stay cleaner.
12. Smell good. Use deodorant. Scented lotions and body wash can be
    used. For perfume, choose a scent that is floral, vanilla-scented,
    or sweet smelling. One or two sprays is enough.
13. Be organized, don't leave your room or your working area messy.
    Clean after every mess, and volunteer to clean other things in your
    home as well. Keep your bag and other belongings organized and
    uncluttered.![](Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_10.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classical_Girl_Step_10.jpg")
14. Keep good grades and aim high. A lady is well educated. Try to learn
    new things in your free time, and develop an interest in things like
    coding, science, literature, music, and more.
15. Develop your talents. Play an instrument, draw, make websites,
    design fashion. Find an activity you like and aim to be one of the
    best at it.
