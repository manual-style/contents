Being "a lady" is about showing that you have class, manners, and good
breeding. Being a classy lady doesn't mean that you should be snobby or
stuck up, but that you should have dignity, consideration, and
moderation in your daily actions. If you want to know how to be a classy
lady, just follow these steps.

## Steps

### Looking Classy

1.  [Improve your posture](Improve_Your_Posture "wikilink"). Having good
    posture is an important part of being classy. Make sure to keep your
    back straight, whether you're sitting down or standing up, and to
    avoid slouching at all costs. Slouching is a sign of laziness and
    bad manners, so make sure you keep your spine straight and your head
    up as much as you
    can.[1]![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Try doing this when you're by yourself, too, so you get used to
        doing it in front of others.
2.  [Maintain good hygiene](Maintain_Good_Hygiene "wikilink"). This
    means showering every day, and always wearing clean clothes, without
    stains. If you're doing something where you'll get dirty, change
    right after. If you're in a situation where you'll get sweaty (e.g.
    a dance), bring an extra shirt just in
    case.![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Be well-groomed. Brush your hair several times a day, if need be,
    and be prepared to put your hair up again if bits are falling out.
    Don't brush your hair in public, though, because it could be seen as
    undignified; wait until you're alone in the bathroom to do
    it.[2]![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Wear classy makeup (optional). If makeup is your thing, then you
    should apply it appropriately. For day-wear, [natural-looking
    makeup](Apply_Makeup_for_a_Natural_Look "wikilink") is the best.
    Little or no makeup is better than smudged makeup. Remember that too
    strong or poorly applied makeup has a tendency to look
    cheap.![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  [Dress elegantly and modestly](Dress_Like_a_Lady "wikilink"). The
    key word here is to dress with dignity. This does not have to cost
    very much. Keep your clothes in good repair. Anything ripped, or
    revealing could potentially be seen as inappropriate although this
    depends on the event or the look you are going for. It is more
    important that the clothes fit you well, are wrinkle-free,
    appropriate for the occasion, and cover all the essential
    bits.[3]![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
    -   This means not wearing anything too short (short skirts or
        shorts), too translucent, or anything that exposes your belly.
    -   If you really wish to wear something a little revealing (deep
        neck, bare shoulders, or a high cut on the skirt), reveal one
        thing only. For example, an evening top with a low neck should
        be accompanied with a long skirt/trousers and have proper
        sleeves that cover the shoulders.
    -   Remember that, when in doubt, it's better to be a little bit
        overdressed than a little bit underdressed. If you're in doubt
        about what to wear to an occasion, it's better to look a little
        nicer than the other guests than to look like you didn't put as
        much time into your looks as the others.

### Acting Classy

1.  Always use refined language. Don't swear or use crude expressions.
    Profanity is one of the least lady-like
    traits.[4]![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you feel that your conversation becomes very dull without the
        use of profanity, remember that this is just temporary. As you
        substitute in non-profane expressions (of which there is a
        virtually limitless supply), you will find your language
        becoming more specific, more expressive, and more interesting.
2.  Be an articulate speaker. If you want to sound classy, then you have
    to [speak clearly](Stop_Mumbling_and_Speak_Clearly "wikilink"),
    avoid mumbling or talking too loudly, and be grammatically correct.
    A classy lady speaks with confidence and talks clearly enough for
    others to understand her. Avoid saying "um," or "like" every two
    seconds, because that will make you look
    unrefined.![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For example, say "Hi Jade, did you finish your homework for
        Science?" instead of saying "Sup Bro, did yo' finish the
        homework cuz I didn't!", the latter being grammatically
        incorrect.
    -   Read regularly to improve your vocabulary and range of
        expression.
3.  Be considerate of others. This is the key to being classy, and
    without this, you will easily be mistaken for a snob. Be
    particularly attentive to the needs of the elderly and remember that
    nobody is beneath your notice. Always [be
    polite](Be_Polite "wikilink"). Classy ladies do not say anything
    hurtful or offensive to other
    people.[5]![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you have to confront someone or put them in their place,
        speak the truth as you see it, but in moderate language and
        without recourse to shouting. It is important to find the right
        time and place for such confrontations.
    -   If you want to be a classy lady, then you should treat waiters,
        strangers, friends of friends, or neighbors with the same level
        of respect you would give to your close friends.
4.  Make people comfortable. Classy ladies are social and at ease with
    others. The key to doing this lies in making the people you meet
    feel at ease and accepted. If this is not easy for you, work on
    [improving your social skills](Improve_Social_Skills "wikilink"),
    and on [being
    charismatic](Be_Charismatic "wikilink").![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Improving your
        [conversational](Have_a_Great_Conversation "wikilink") skills is
        a great way of putting people at ease, and making an impression
        as a well-bred and well-informed lady.
5.  Perfect your etiquette. A good start is to always [be
    polite](Be_Polite "wikilink") and to say thank you once too often
    rather than too little. A firm grasp on etiquette is also helpful if
    you get nervous in social situations, because you'll always know how
    you're supposed to
    act.[6]![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_10.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Learn [dinner etiquette](Act_at_a_Dinner_Party "wikilink"),
        party etiquette, workplace etiquette, and dating etiquette to
        become more ladylike.
    -   Remember that it is really poor etiquette to comment on or make
        a fuss about other people's lack of etiquette or manners. Unless
        the situation really warrants it (their behavior may cause harm
        to themselves or others, or is on the way far side of moral and
        acceptable behaviour), graciously overlook their gaffes and
        shortcomings.
6.  Avoid gossiping about others. Malicious gossip or speaking badly of
    people behind their back is not very lady-like. Though you may be
    angry at someone or feel wronged, gossiping about it to a third
    party will not solve your problems. If you want to be a classy lady,
    then you have to restrain yourself and avoid saying anything
    negative about other people unless you want to cause trouble for
    yourself.[7]![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_11.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_11.jpg")
    -   Keep your Facebook posts classy, too. Stick to the positive
        instead of ranting about "some people" who have done you wrong.
7.  Stand up for yourself with dignity. Being classy and polite does not
    in any way mean being a pushover or voicing opinions that are not
    your own. If you deem that your opinions may be too forceful or may
    be hurtful to those present, do not lie, but change the topic to
    something else. If someone asks an impertinent question, do not feel
    obliged to answer - make a joke, or endeavor to turn the question
    around.![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_12.jpg")
    -   When you do stand up for yourself, state your case without
        resorting to name-calling or getting overly emotional.

### Going the Extra Mile

1.  [Be well-read.](Be_Well-Read "wikilink") Read novels to find
    role-models for etiquette and good manners. Jane Austen is
    exceptional in her shrewd portrayal of good and bad manners and
    morals, and a must-read for anyone wishing to be a classy lady.
    Reading classic novels also has the benefit or making you a
    well-informed lady, and there is nothing classy about
    ignorance.[8]![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_13.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Being well-read will also make you able to make more
        sophisticated conversation.
2.  Find classy friends. If you're really determined to be classy, then
    you have to seek out classy company. If your friends are bringing
    down your level of classiness or not supporting your new mindset,
    then you may want to seek out other people who help you become your
    true classy lady self. These people should be confident,
    self-assured, and maybe a little bit older and more mature so you
    can learn from
    them.![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_14.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_14.jpg")
    -   Your friends should lift you up, not bring you down, so you
        should hang out with people who make you want to be *better*
        than you actually are.
3.  Be a conscientious citizen. Part of being classy means being a good,
    conscientious citizen. What the heck does this mean? A number of
    things. Don't leave your shopping cart hanging out in the parking
    lot after you've put your groceries in your trunk; return it to the
    cart aisle. Let pedestrians cross in front of you when you're
    driving. Hold the door for the elderly, even if you're in a
    rush.![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_15.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_15.jpg")
    -   If you've dropped something in the supermarket, clean it up or
        tell an employee what happened. Don't just walk away from your
        mess.
4.  Drop the habits of an unclassy lady. If you're really committed to
    being classy, then you have to get rid of a few things that may be
    making you look less classy than you really are.[9] Here are some
    good things to
    avoid:![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_16.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_16.jpg")
    -   Loudly smacking your gum
    -   Loudly chewing your food
    -   Burping in public
    -   Getting too drunk in public
    -   Giving people the finger
    -   Cursing
    -   Rolling your eyes
    -   Farting in public
    -   Picking your nose
    -   Kissing in public
5.  [Accept responsibility for your own
    actions](Accept_Blame_when_You_Deserve_It "wikilink"). Being able to
    own what you've done in your life is the height of class. It's not
    classy to play the victim, blame all your problems on someone else,
    or to say, "I would have been able to do thing X if only Y
    hadn't..." Stop whining or making excuses and understand that life
    is what you make of it and that you have the power to be as classy
    as you want and to have a life as good as you want it to
    be.![](Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_17.jpg "fig:Be_a_Classy_Lady_Step_17.jpg")
    -   It's not classy to complain about all of the things you don't
        have. It's classy to admit that you have a lot of work to do to
        become the person you really want to be.

## Tips

-   Keep your face clear and your hair shiny.
-   Reading and/or watching period novels and dramas can be a great
    inspiration. However, remember that today things are no longer as
    stiff and formal as they once were.
-   It's about [being proper](Be_Proper "wikilink"). Education and
    kindness are an important part of classy.
-   If you're in school, [get good grades](Get_Good_Grades "wikilink").

## Warnings

-   [Don't be a snob](Not_Be_a_Snob "wikilink") or act like younger
    people, or people in the service industries, are inferior. You
    should always be [nice](Be_Nice "wikilink") and
    [friendly](Be_Friendly "wikilink") to everyone.
