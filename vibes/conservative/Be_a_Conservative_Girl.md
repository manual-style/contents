Although the term ‘conservative’ is often applied to a person’s
political leanings, there are actually a number of different ways you
can be a conservative girl. For instance, you might choose to dress
conservatively even if you lean to the left politically—especially if
you’re traveling to a place where you’ll be expected to dress modestly.
Similarly, you might choose to live a conservative lifestyle, even if
you dress radically. However you choose to embody being conservative,
remember, the important thing is to always be true to yourself!

## Steps

### Dressing Conservatively

1.  Opt for clothing that covers your body from the shoulders to the
    knees. When you’re dressing conservatively, it’s important not to
    show too much skin, especially your shoulders, cleavage, midriff,
    and upper legs. If the weather is hot, opt for loose, flowy clothing
    to help keep you cool, rather than skimpy clothing that will leave
    you
    exposed.[1]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Short sleeves are usually fine when you’re dressing
        conservatively, but if you’re in doubt whether that’s
        appropriate, opt for an elbow-length or long-sleeved shirt to be
        on the safe side.
    -   In some places, skirts that stop just above the knee are
        considered conservative. However, in some cultures, showing your
        knees or even your ankles would still be considered
        revealing.[2]
2.  Add layers if you need a little more coverage. If you’re concerned
    that your favorite clothes show too much skin, mix-and-match them
    with layering pieces to help you cover up. Layers are also good if
    your clothing is sheer or
    transparent.[3]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
    -   For instance, you can wear a cami underneath a V-neck shirt to
        ensure you don’t show too much cleavage, and a long tank top is
        a great option if you think your shirt might ride up and expose
        your midriff.
    -   You can also layer a lightweight shirt, blouse, or scarf over a
        pretty spaghetti-strap dress to cover your shoulders and chest.
3.  Avoid wearing clothes that fit very tightly. Sometimes, you can show
    too much of your figure even when you’re completely covered up. If
    you want to dress conservatively, avoid styles that fit tightly
    around your bust, waist, or hips. However, you don’t necessarily
    have to wear shapeless, baggy clothes, either. Instead, stick to
    styles that skim lightly over your figure. Not only will this be
    more comfortable and modest, but it tends to be a more flattering
    look, as
    well.[4]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   If you’re wearing leggings, yoga pants, or another style of
        pants that fit snugly to your body, opt for a long tunic or a
        blouse that covers your crotch and rear.
4.  Wear mostly neutrals with a few pops of colors. Dressing
    conservatively typically means gravitating toward tasteful neutral
    shades like black, white, beige, tan, blue, gray, and ivory.
    However, if you love bright colors, you don't have to stop wearing
    them! Just wear one brightly-colored piece at a time, and keep the
    rest of your outfit toned
    down.[5]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   For instance, if you’re going to work, you might wear a grey
        blazer, slacks, and shoes, with a magenta blouse. On the other
        hand, you might opt for a white blouse and add color with a
        statement necklace, instead.
5.  Keep your accessories minimal. If you want to look conservative,
    don’t pile on all of your accessories at once. Instead, stick to 2
    or 3 pretty pieces when you’re getting dressed, like a string of
    pearls, a simple ring, and a nice
    watch.[6]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
    -   It’s okay to use bold jewelry to add pizazz to your outfit, but
        stick to one statement piece at a time. If you’re wearing a
        chunky, colorful necklace, for instance, you might skip wearing
        earrings, or just wear a pair of subtle studs.
6.  Stick to practical footwear. For the most part, it’s prudent to
    avoid stiletto heels or flashy footwear that’s hard to walk in.
    Instead, opt for tasteful flats or low pumps, although ankle and
    knee-high boots can look conservative depending on how the rest of
    your outfit is styled.
    [7]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_6_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_6_Version_3.jpg")
    -   For instance, knee-high boots would be the perfect way to
        complete a fall outfit if you were wearing a knee-length skirt,
        dark tights or leggings, and a sweater.
7.  Wear your hair well-groomed in a classic style. There’s no one
    perfect haircut that will make you look conservative, but avoid
    getting a severe cut, like a close-cropped style or a style that’s
    shaved on one side. However, styles like a sleek, straight bob,
    loose waves, a low bun, and long curls can all be well-suited for a
    conservative girl, as long as you keep your hair clean and neatly
    styled each
    day.[8]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_7_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_7_Version_3.jpg")
    -   If you color your hair, opt for natural-looking shades,
        including highlights, rather than bold colors like green, pink,
        or purple.
8.  Opt for [light, tasteful
    makeup](Apply_Makeup_for_a_Natural_Look "wikilink") if you wear any.
    You won’t look very conservative if you wear a full glam look in the
    daytime. Instead, stick to a simple routine, such as concealer,
    tinted moisturizer, mascara, blush, and lip
    gloss.[9]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_8_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_8_Version_3.jpg")
    -   It’s okay to wear a little more makeup for special occasions.
        For instance, you might add eyeshadow, eyeliner, and lipstick to
        your normal makeup routine if you’re going on a date or
        attending a wedding.
9.  Cover up any tattoos if you have them. Visible tattoos don’t look
    very conservative, so if you already have them, try to cover them
    with makeup or your clothing. If you don’t have any tattoos, or if
    the ones you have are easily covered, avoid getting anything new
    that would be hard to cover up, like tattoos on your hands, face,
    forearms, or
    chest.[10]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_9_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_9_Version_3.jpg")
    -   For the most part, visible piercings wouldn't be considered
        conservative. However, a small, tasteful nose ring might be an
        exception, depending on your personal style.

### Having a Conservative Lifestyle

1.  [Go to bed early](Go_to_Bed_Early "wikilink") and rise early each
    day. If you want to live a conservative lifestyle, it won’t do to
    stay up all night partying (or watching cat videos). In order to be
    at your most productive during the day, go to bed at a reasonable
    hour, and try to stick to the same bedtime each night. Then, wake at
    the same time every morning, even the
    weekends.[11]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_10_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_10_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Keeping a regular routine will help you sleep better at night.
2.  [Eat a healthy diet](Eat_Healthy "wikilink") full of lean proteins,
    fruits, and vegetables. You can apply conservative living to
    everything, even to the way you eat, so try to avoid making a habit
    of binging on indulgent treats. About half of what you eat should be
    nutritious fruits and vegetables like leafy greens, avocados,
    apples, and legumes. Another quarter should be lean proteins like
    chicken, turkey, tofu, and fish, and the final quarter should be
    whole grains, like wheat bread, quinoa, and brown
    rice.[12]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_11_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_11_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Preparing your meals at home is a great way to have more control
        over the foods that you eat.
3.  Avoid drinking alcohol excessively, if at all. Drinking too much
    alcohol can be bad for your health, but it can also lead to reckless
    behavior and a lapse in judgment. If you want to maintain a
    conservative lifestyle, it’s important to avoid this loss of
    control. If you do want to enjoy any alcoholic beverages, do so in
    moderation.[13]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_12_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_12_Version_3.jpg")
    -   For instance, if you have a glass of wine with dinner, ask for a
        glass of water after you finish it. If you’d still like another
        glass when you finish the water, then it’s fine.
4.  Take dating slowly. To be conservative in your romantic life, take
    your time before committing to a relationship with another person.
    Make sure that you only date someone because you really like them
    and can imagine yourself being with them in the long term. Also,
    avoid rushing into a physical relationship with anyone to avoid the
    appearance of being
    promiscuous.[14]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_13_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_13_Version_3.jpg")
    -   If you’re already in a relationship, take some time to evaluate
        whether the two of you have the same long-term goals and values.
5.  Consume thoughtful media that promotes family values. These days, it
    can be hard to avoid depictions of sex and violence in TV and
    movies, and social media can be full of a steady stream of content
    that’s opposed to a conservative lifestyle. Try to tailor what
    you’re watching and consuming so you’re only taking in wholesome
    entertainment, as much as possible.[15]
    .![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_14.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_14.jpg")
    -   For instance, you might unfollow anyone on your friend list who
        regularly posts memes that you find offensive.
    -   You might also avoid watching movies that are rated R,
        especially if they got that rating because they’re bloody, have
        foul language, or are filled with nudity.
6.  Be prudent with your finances. Being financially conservative is
    smart for everyone, but it can be hard to do. [Make a
    budget](Budget_Your_Money "wikilink") and stick to it. Each time you
    get a paycheck, pay your bills before you make any purchases, so
    you’ll know exactly what you have left over. Then, set aside a
    little of what’s left in a savings account so you’ll be prepared in
    case of an unforeseen
    emergency.[16]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_15.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_15.jpg")
    -   Also, try to get in the habit of limiting any unnecessary
        purchases.

### Being Politically Conservative

1.  Understand that you don't have to support every conservative cause.
    You can consider yourself politically conservative without
    necessarily agreeing with everything that would be considered
    conservative. There’s no one right way to be a conservative, so take
    some time to learn about different issues, and evaluate your beliefs
    to determine which ones you support, as well as which ones you
    don’t.![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_16.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_16.jpg")
    -   For instance, social conservatives typically believe that
        abortion should be restricted or banned, and that gay marriage
        should not be legal. However, you can be politically
        conservative—which means you believe in things like less
        government interference and a free market economy—without
        necessarily being a social conservative.
2.  Champion causes that promote individual liberty. Political
    conservatives believe that your individual freedoms are the most
    important thing that needs to be protected. That means you would
    oppose any laws that allow the government or other people to
    infringe on your
    freedom.[17]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_17.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_17.jpg")
    -   For instance, most political conservatives oppose strict gun
        control laws that might impede the 2nd Amendment right to bear
        arms.
3.  Support initiatives that limit the government's role. One of the
    most universal beliefs among conservatives is that a smaller
    government is more efficient and effective. This might mean limiting
    laws that regulate environmental policies, for instance, or
    supporting privatized healthcare.[18]
    ![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_18.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_18.jpg")
4.  Study and support the free market system. If you’re an economic
    conservative, you believe that a free market promotes competition.
    You likely also believe that such competition leads to a healthier
    economy, with more jobs overall, as well as a higher standard of
    living for society as a
    whole.[19]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_19.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_19.jpg")
    -   This would also involve being against social programs that
        inhibit a free market, like universal healthcare.
5.  Emphasize personal responsibility over social support or government
    regulation. In addition to having individual liberty, as a
    conservative, you will also likely believe that each person should
    be responsible for their own actions. This might mean holding people
    accountable for things they’ve done wrong, but it also might mean
    being opposed to certain social
    programs.[20]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_20.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_20.jpg")
    -   For instance, you might support the death penalty for certain
        crimes, but you might be against programs that allow people to
        stay on welfare for long periods of time.
    -   You might also oppose amnesty for immigrants who came into the
        country illegally, even if you support immigration reform that
        would allow people an easier path to become citizens of your
        country.
6.  Place a high priority on traditional values. Typically,
    conservatives see themselves as being responsible for holding up
    traditional morals and conventions. For instance, you might be
    opposed to abortion or gay marriage, or you might support
    legislation limiting the kind of content that can be shown on
    websites that cater to young
    children.[21]![](Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_21_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Conservative_Girl_Step_21_Version_2.jpg")
    -   You might also oppose any interpretations of the Constitution
        that you don’t feel accurately represent the Founding Fathers’
        original intent.
