Being country isn't about wearing certain clothes, listening to specific
music, or talking in a particular manner. Instead, it's about adopting a
certain attitude, working hard, and learning new skills. Living in the
country can be the greatest adventure of your life, especially if you
take a few steps to adopt the lifestyle.

## Steps

### Dressing Country

1.  Opt for a functional pair of fancy cowboy or cowgirl boots. Boots
    should be functional first and foremost because they are meant to
    protect your feet and ankles as you ride. However, you can also have
    a fancy pair for going into town. Whatever kind you choose, they are
    the perfect complement to any
    outfit.[1]![](Be_Country_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Boots can be made from anything, including leather, snakeskin,
        and even ostrich.
2.  Get a pair of long jeans. Jeans should gather on top of your boots.
    That's because if you get on a horse, you don't want the bottom of
    your jeans to lift above the tops of your boots. The jeans should
    also be boot-cut, meaning they fit over your boots but still stay
    close to your
    legs.[2]![](Be_Country_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Wrangler jeans are a good option because the seams are on the
        outer edges rather than the inside. That means they won't chafe
        as much.
    -   You can also opt for overalls if you prefer.
3.  Tuck in a button-down shirt. A button-down shirt is the perfect
    complement to a good pair of jeans. Long-sleeve is traditional, but
    you can wear short-sleeve if that's more comfortable. Plaid is
    always a good choice, but you can also wear prints or plain colors
    if you'd
    like.[3]![](Be_Country_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   It's important to tuck it in if you want the classic country
        look.
4.  Try a loose dress over skinny jeans and boots. Another classic look
    is wearing a maxi dress or a shorter dress over skinny jeans. If you
    opt for skinny jeans, though, make sure to tuck them into your boots
    instead of the other way
    around.[4]![](Be_Country_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Any kind of dress will work for this look, really, but aim for
        one that has a loose fit over the bottom half of your body.
5.  Add accessories like belts and hats. A hat isn't strictly necessary,
    but it's a good way to top off your outfit. The only option is a
    western-style cowboy hat, which helps to keep the sun off while
    you're outside. Suede or leather are your best choices. A leather
    belt is also a good addition in brown or
    black.[5]![](Be_Country_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
    -   A large belt buckle with a western theme is optional but fun.
6.  Dress how you want and be comfortable. Sure, you can don a pair of
    cowboy boots, jeans, and a button-down shirt, but really, life in
    the country is about being practical and comfortable. You don't need
    to worry about designer labels (unless it's that fancy brand of
    cowboy boots). Just dress how you want instead of trying to impress
    people with fancy
    labels.[6]![](Be_Country_Step_6_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_6_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Keep in mind, though, that if you wear stilettos and a short
        black dress to the grocery store, you might stick out a little
        bit.

### Working on the Country Attitude

1.  Relax and appreciate the small things. While you can go to a fancy
    new restaurant or a hip club every night, you need to learn to slow
    down and be grateful for the small joys in life for a country
    attitude. Make yourself some fresh lemonade, plant some lovely
    smelling flowers, or take a walk through the country or a park. Pet
    your dog or just cook yourself a fresh meal with ingredients from
    your garden or the local farmer's market. It's these little things
    that make country life
    special.[7]![](Be_Country_Step_7_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_7_Version_3.jpg")
2.  Greet neighbors and strangers alike. In the country, life is a
    little slower, and people tend to be a little nicer. It's common to
    wave to your neighbors and to hold a conversation with the clerk
    while you're checking out at the grocery store. Don't be afraid to
    say hello or strike up a conversation when you meet
    people.[8]![](Be_Country_Step_8_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_8_Version_3.jpg")
3.  Embrace the quiet and solitude. While many small-town communities
    are close-knit, you're still going to be spending a lot of time on
    your own. Be ready to entertain yourself with books and hobbies,
    while enjoying life with your family, if you have one. If you don't
    live in the country, try embracing solitude in your city life by
    spending time alone in your home or out in
    nature.[9]![](Be_Country_Step_9_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_9_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Spend time outdoors enjoying the view and take in the night
        stars!
4.  [Reduce and reuse](Reduce,_Reuse,_and_Recycle "wikilink")
    everything. When you live in the country, it takes more work to get
    the things you need. You learn to be resourceful and reuse the
    things you have so you don't have to run into town every few
    minutes. Don't have a flowerpot? Use that old bucket you had for
    washing your car. Need a food dish for your dog? Cut up an old
    coffee container and wash it out
    thoroughly.[10]![](Be_Country_Step_10_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_10_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Plus, when you live in the country, you may not have trash
        pickup. You'll want to reduce your waste as much as possible!
        That same principle is just as smart if you live in a city.
5.  Get involved in town and community events. Many people who live in
    the country get involved in their local communities, and you can do
    the same. Try going to local festivals that are unique to what's
    grown in the area, such as a watermelon festival or even a sorghum
    festival! Your area may have events that cropped due to people who
    immigrated to the area, such as Italian, Polish, German, or Greek
    festivals. Alternatively, try participating in events at your
    library or going to political events. Your local church or community
    center may have community events,
    too.![](Be_Country_Step_11_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_11_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Keep an eye out when you're in town. You're sure to see posters
        for local events!
6.  Be kind to your neighbors. In the country, everyone tends to look
    out for one another, and you can do the same. Check in on your
    neighbors when they're sick, for instance, or invite them over for
    dinner. Alternatively, share your bounty with them. Maybe you have
    an abundance of herbs growing on your windowsill or you just made
    your grandma's molasses
    cookies.[11]![](Be_Country_Step_12_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_12_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Sharing with your neighbors is a country tradition! Plus, it's a
        great way to meet people and make friends with those who live
        nearby.
7.  Enjoy the views and wildlife with friends and family. There are many
    ways to enjoy the outside world, from having a barbecue to hosting a
    bonfire! You can also take hikes or go fishing. Just take time to be
    outside and enjoy nature. Being together with friends and family is
    a great way to create bonds that will last a
    lifetime.[12]![](Be_Country_Step_13_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_13_Version_3.jpg")

### Learning Relevant Skills

1.  Try your hand at [canning](Can_Food "wikilink") and
    [jam-making](Make_Jam "wikilink"). Canning and jam-making are
    popular in the country because it's an easy way to save an
    overabundant harvest for later. When canning, always boil your lids
    and jars first so they're sterile. Fill up the jars with what you're
    canning, making sure the liquid comes up to about from the top of
    the jar. Use a clean rag to go around the top before putting the
    lids on. Use canning tongs to set the jars in water and boil them
    for the recommended time to complete the canning
    process.[13]![](Be_Country_Step_14_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_14_Version_3.jpg")
    -   How long you process the jars depends on what you're canning.
        After you've removed the jars with tongs, listen for the "ping"
        of the lids, which means they're popping down and sealing the
        jars.
2.  Learn to [sew](Sew "wikilink"). You can of course still buy your
    clothes from the store, but sewing your own clothes or linens can be
    a fun country pastime since you don't have quick access to the
    store. Watch some videos online or take a course on how to use a
    sewing machine. After that, try reading a pattern. Start with
    something basic, like a pillow, before jumping into something like a
    shirt or
    dress.[14]![](Be_Country_Step_15_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_15_Version_3.jpg")
    -   For a simple sewing project, place 2 squares of fabric together
        with the wrong side out. Sew around the outside from the edges.
        Leave unsewn and turn it inside out. Stuff the inside, then use
        a [slip stitch](Slip_Stitch "wikilink") to finish your pillow.
3.  [Plant a garden](Plant_a_Garden "wikilink"). Gardening is a
    long-standing country tradition since you have the space to grow
    your own food. To start a garden, begin your seeds in potting soil 2
    weeks before the last frost, which you can look up online. Till an
    area in a sunny location in your garden and mix in some compost for
    fertilizer. Plant your seedlings in the garden once they reach ,
    noting how far they should be spaced apart on the seed package. Keep
    your garden watered throughout the
    summer.[15]![](Be_Country_Step_16_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_16_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Some vegetables will be ready to harvest in mid-summer, such as
        tomatoes and lettuce. You can also plant lettuce at 2 different
        times so you have it available for longer.
    -   Try veggies like tomatoes, cucumbers, watermelon, and lettuce.
4.  Raise chickens or other farm animals. Raising animals is popular in
    the country because you have the space and time to do it. Farm
    animals can be a source of food (chicken eggs) and milk (goats or
    cows). Research the animals you'd like to raise, and then put
    together a proper habitat for them. You'll also need to research
    food, medical care, and
    supplements.[16]![](Be_Country_Step_17_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Country_Step_17_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Chickens and ducks are both easy to raise, though chickens will
        need a coop to roost in at night. Goats and cows will need to be
        milked each day and will also need a habitat.
