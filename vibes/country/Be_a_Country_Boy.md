This is how to become a blue jean wearing, pickup truck driving, country
boy. There's a difference between country boys, rednecks, and cowboys.

## Steps

### Wear the right clothes

1.  A suit and tie aint gonna cut it if you wanna be a country boy. Try
    Levi's, Wrangler, or a brand like that. Blue jeans are your friends,
    they are durable and take beatings. You will also want some tee
    shirts and quality jackets. Along with a worn hat and some
    comfortable footwear. You can try some Romeo's.

### Drive the right automobile

1.  You will never see a true country boy driving a Prius or Smart Car.
    Country boys are often spotted in pickup trucks, most commonly Ford
    or Chevy. Maybe even GMC.

### Live in the right parts

1.  If you wanna be a country boy, you gotta live in the country. Small
    towns and farm lands are the best spots to live. Whether you live on
    a ranch or on a farm, or even a rambler, you can be a country boy.
    But no living in the city.

### Know how to take care of yourself

1.  Country boys know how to take care of themselves. Whether it's
    fixing your truck up or defending your home, be prepared. Country
    boys usually carry a reliable pistol at all times, and have a few
    rifles in the house.

### Act like a country boy

1.  You gotta be a country boy, to be a country boy. You gotta work
    hard, act tough, and always find ways to succeed. Rain or shine,
    you're out in the field working on something.
