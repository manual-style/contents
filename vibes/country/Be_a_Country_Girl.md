Do you look up to Kacey Musgraves, Carrie Underwood, Kellie Pickler, or
Miranda Lambert? Are you wondering what it is really like to be a
country girl? Being a country girl is a combination of mastering a
mentality and perfecting a look, although no two country gals are the
same. Follow these simple steps to get closer to what it means to be a
country girl!

## Steps

### Appearance

1.  Get the hair! Country girls love braids, volume, and curls. Your
    hair should be long, wavy and natural, preferably. Curly/wavy is
    preferred, but if it's straight, that's fine too. Country girls
    either have brunette, or red hair, or blonde (whatever your natural
    color is). Leave all the pink, purple, metallic and silver to the
    city
    girls!![](Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Get the boots. Every country girl needs her boots! Have ones
    specially made for you or get some from your local store. Every
    country girl owns **camo** for hunting and owns a pair of either for
    riding, show, or
    work.![](Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Practice good hygiene. When country girls aren't outside working and
    getting dirty, you can bet they're **clean**. Just because they work
    and sweat doesn't mean they can't smell like a tulip when the sun
    goes down. Shower regularly, brush your teeth twice a day, and don't
    forget to floss. Use deodorant and only one spritz of a flowery,
    summery, light
    perfume.![](Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Keep your makeup natural and minimal. You shouldn't look fake. Just
    fresh and pretty. If you do need a little coverage, a few drops of
    tinted moisturizer will even out your complexion without looking
    caked.![](Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_4.jpg")
    -   Dark circles are not fresh looking, so apply a light-reflecting
        concealer close to the lash line if you have them. Dust a little
        powder on top to set.
    -   Curl your eyelashes. If you are blessed with naturally dark,
        long lashes, stop here. If not, apply 1-2 coats of brown mascara
        to the upper lashes only.
    -   Apply a neutral blush to the apples of your cheeks. Use what is
        left on the brush after doing your cheeks to sweep on your
        forehead, nose, and chin.
    -   Finish off the look with a clear or neutral gloss on the lips
        (no shimmer, please).

### Activities

1.  Spend lots of time outdoors. Country girls don't waste their lives
    inside watching TV and on the computer! They work hard, and they
    work for a reason. When they're not, they're outside with friends,
    being carefree, or simply lying in the sun, taking in some vitamin
    D!![](Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_5.jpg")
    -   A lot of country girls work on farms. This means bailing hay,
        milking cows, building fences, tending to livestock. You don't
        need to live on a farm to be country, but it certainly helps.
    -   When not working, a country girl might simply like to take a
        hike, hang near a watering hole, or just be outside. Country
        girls are all pretty self-sufficient, which means that they
        learn to do things without much technology and without the help
        of others.
    -   Lots of country girls go hunting, mudding, fishing, camping,
        horse riding, 4-wheeling, and most importantly, dancing! These
        are things that teens who live in the South do nearly *every*
        weekend.
2.  Know and participate in sports. Country girls usually like watching
    and playing football, and often like horses. This doesn't mean they
    can't be girly though! Girlishness actually complements your country
    girl attitude. Country girls can also be very girly and, when
    accessorizing, get shiny and pink things,
    too.![](Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_6.jpg")
    -   Get involved with football. Country girls love their
        **football**, especially college football. Make sure you watch
        the games and know who your favorite team(s) is/are! If you
        don't have one, just go for your home team.
    -   Learn to enjoy some traditional games. Cornhole, horseshoe
        pitch, and stock-car driving, to name a few, occupy a special
        place for a lot of country girls.
3.  Never turn down an opportunity to get down in the dirt. Country
    girls are also hard workers not afraid to get dirty. Go outside and
    mow the lawn or help your dad on the car,
    etc.![](Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_7.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_7.jpg")
4.  Learn to love animals. Have a lot of pets. Good country dogs are
    types of bloodhounds, coonhounds, retrievers, cattle dogs, and
    collies, to name a few. Basically any hound is
    great.![](Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_8.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_8.jpg")
    -   Don't just get an animal for the sake of having one. If you
        decide to get a pet, know that your responsibility is to take
        care of it and nurture it to adulthood, not abandon it as soon
        as it stops being cute and fluffy.
    -   Dogs make a great hunting partner. If you're hunting turkey,
        grouse, duck, or quail, think about convincing your family to
        get a hunting dog to assist you. It's rewarding for the dog and
        gives you a hunting companion.
5.  Know your stuff. Go to school and try to get good education. Learn
    all about the animal kingdom, too. Know the name of at least five
    mountains, lakes or farms. If you want to pursue a career off of
    being country, study biology, agriculture,(farming) zoology
    (animals), or marine
    biology.![](Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_9.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Country girls might not know anything about operas or be
        "sophisticated," but that doesn't mean they are dumb. In fact,
        country girls know a lot of practical knowledge and are very
        connected to nature. Don't play shallow or dumb just because you
        think that's what country is — it isn't!
    -   Part of the education of a country girl is knowing how things
        work. Whether it's fixing the carburetor, plant hybridization,
        or just knowing how to prepare a perfect fillet, being “country
        smart” is all about knowing what's around you and how it works.

### Attitude

1.  Mind your manners. "Yes, ma'am" and "No, sir" should always be in
    your vocabulary, right between "please" and "thank you." Don't talk
    southern if that's not your real voice—it'll come off as fake and
    possibly insulting. A girl from Alaska can be just as country as a
    girl from Alabama, even without the
    accent.![](Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_10.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_10.jpg")
2.  Learn to love country music like Miranda Lambert, Josh Turner,
    Trisha Yearwood, Tim McGraw, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Kellie
    Pickler, Toby Keith, Jason Aldean, Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan,
    Alan Jackson and Billy Ray Cyrus. These all should be household
    names to
    you.![](Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_11.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_11.jpg")
    -   Concerts are great places to listen to live music and hang out
        with friends. Try to go to a few shows to get a feel for what
        country music sounds like up close and in person!
3.  Be sure to hold your own. Country girls are mild-mannered, polite,
    and easy-going if you had to generalize; but they don't tolerate
    foolishness and they certainly aren't afraid to tell things like
    they are. Learn to trust your convictions and stand by
    them.![](Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Faith is a cornerstone for many country girls, but it doesn't
        need to be. Many country girls are devout believers who go to
        church every Sunday and have a strong relationship with their
        congregation. If this is you, that's great; keep doing what
        you're doing. If that's not you, don't feel like you need to
        force it. Be yourself and good things will come.
    -   Country girls respect their boys, but don't let them take
        advantage of anything. Country girls are sweet, sensitive,
        self-sacrificing. But they also demand loyalty and respect back
        from their men.
4.  Be proud to be a country girl. Be proud of who you are and where you
    come from. People will respect that. If people say, "I hate the
    country," don't get flustered or upset, but be friendly and act
    nice, so others will have nothing to hold against you. If you find
    out that they are putting you down, still try to act nice, but don't
    act
    rude.![](Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_13.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Girl_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Country girls are bubbly, bright, strong-willing, funny, and
        down-to-earth people. Plus country girls are all full of fun and
        they love goofing around, especially if they're around sand,
        water and a sunset with a few beach chairs.
    -   Be humble. Don't be arrogant. Country folk are kind,
        warm-hearted, and generous. Practice giving to other people not
        expecting anything in return. Practice giving people the benefit
        of the doubt.
    -   Be fun and funny. Humor sure can keep you happy if you’re blue.
        Crack a funny joke every now and then! And don't be afraid to
        crack one about yourself sometimes; it shows you don't take
        yourself too seriously.
    -   Be adventurous. Spend time outside and get to know the world.

## Tips

-   If you love amusement and/ or theme parks then that's ok, you can
    still love amusement and theme parks and still be a country girl.
-   Go to state parks or national parks near you whenever you have time.
    This is a very good opportunity to spend time outdoors and you might
    even learn something about certain animals.
-   If the weather outside is nice enough try going outside to read a
    book, this is a fun activity to do in your free time and it even
    gives you an opportunity to be around nature.
