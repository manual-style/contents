A cowgirl was traditionally a girl or woman who herded cattle and worked
on a ranch, but being a cowgirl today is so much more. Being a cowgirl
is about knowing your cowgirl roots, [dressing like a
cowgirl](Dress_Like_a_Cowgirl "wikilink"), and acting like a cowgirl.
Following these steps will get you on the path to earning your cowgirl
credibility.

## Steps

### Adopting the Culture

1.  Learn cowgirl history. Knowing the origins of the cowgirl is
    essential to becoming a modern
    cowgirl.![](Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Cowboys and cowgirls originated in Texas.
    -   Although cowgirl history is not documented as well as cowboy
        history, we know that cowgirls existed during the Golden Age of
        the cowboy (1866-1886).[1]
    -   While the men were either at war or driving thousands of cattle
        up north, cowgirls worked on the ranches, riding horses and
        caring for livestock.
    -   The modern cowgirl may also herd cattle and work on a ranch or
        farm, but cowgirl life today also involves riding in rodeos.
2.  Find out if this is the right choice for you. Becoming a cowgirl
    requires a great deal of hard physical work and commitment, and
    therefore isn't for
    everyone.![](Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
    -   You should be willing to learn how to do physical things like
        riding a horse and roping cattle.
    -   If you don't like working with animals, being outside, or
        getting dirty, you might want to rethink becoming a cowgirl.
3.  Visit a cattle ranch. Learning how to work with cows is a
    traditional part of being a cowgirl, hence the title
    “cowgirl.”![](Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Look online for a local farm or ranch that allows visitors, and
        see what it's like to work in there for a day. You can also
        volunteer at a farm or ranch to learn the basics.
    -   Many cattle ranches also offer tours that teach you about living
        and working with cattle.
    -   You can learn a lot about cattle: how to [feed
        cattle](Feed_Cattle "wikilink"), how to [herd
        cattle](Herd_Cattle "wikilink"), how to [wean
        cattle](Wean_Cattle "wikilink"), even how to [butcher
        cattle](Butcher_Cattle "wikilink").

### Dressing Like a Cowgirl

1.  Know that it's not just about looking good. Cowgirls do hard,
    physical work, and their clothing needs to be functional, not just
    stylish.![](Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Many of the stylistic elements associated with being a cowboy or
        cowgirl actually have a practical origin.
    -   Because cowgirls work with large animals, they will often be
        covered in dirt, blood, spit, and snot. It may sound gross, but
        it is a reality of the lifestyle.[2]
    -   There is a lot of stylish, practical cowgirl clothing available
        online or at Western clothing stores.
2.  Get the cowgirl basics. There are some items of clothing that every
    cowgirl needs in her wardrobe both for work and for
    play.![](Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Denim jeans - they are comfortable, durable, wash easily, and
        protect your legs from getting cut or chafed. Boot cut jeans are
        best when you're wearing cowgirl boots.
    -   Long-sleeved shirts - they can be worn all year long. In the
        summer, cowgirls will wear breathable, long-sleeved shirts to
        protect their arms while they're out in the hot sun all day. In
        the winter, a thicker long-sleeved shirt helps keep the cowgirl
        warm.
    -   Boots - these are essential to a cowgirl's wardrobe. They were
        created to easily and comfortably fit into stirrups, protect the
        wearer from scratches and snake bites, and provide traction when
        leading horses or cattle, but are now made to be more stylish as
        well.
    -   Hats - they will protect a cowgirl's face from getting burned,
        and also protect her eyes from the sun.
    -   Dresses and skirts - they can be in any style, but good, clean
        denim is always in style for a cowgirl. Part of the fun of
        cowgirl fashion is wearing pretty dresses and cute denim skirts
        out to a concert, steak dinner, or the rodeo.
    -   Nice boots - they should be more decorative and a maybe a little
        less functional than your work boots, because you'll be wearing
        them out to dinner or parties.
3.  Dress for the situation. Like anyone else, cowgirls don't dress the
    exact same way for every occasion. Knowing what is appropriate to
    wear in different situations is important when it comes to cowgirl
    fashion.![](Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_6_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_6_Version_3.jpg")
    -   A cowgirl isn't going to wear a fancy dress out horseback riding
        or cattle-roping, just as she wouldn't wear dirty jeans and
        muddy boots out to a nice dinner. Gauge what attire is
        appropriate for the situation.
    -   Variety is important. Buy plenty of jeans and shirts for
        everyday wear, but also have dresses, nice shirts, dress pants,
        nice jeans, and fancy shoes in your closet for nicer occasions.
    -   Make practicality your first concern with everyday dress, and
        style your second concern.

### Acting Like a Cowgirl

1.  Learn to [ride a horse](Ride_a_Horse "wikilink"). A horse is the
    cowgirl's closest companion, so an important step in acting like a
    cowgirl is learning to horseback
    ride.![](Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_7_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_7_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Taking horse-riding lessons from a professional is the safest
        bet for beginners.
    -   Many cities offer a variety of horseback riding classes suited
        for every age and experience level.
    -   Know which type of riding lessons you want to take. Some
        different styles of riding are Western, Endurance, Saddle seat,
        and Racing.[3]
        -   Western style is the most appropriate for a working cowgirl.
2.  Learn to [rope cattle](Rope_Cattle "wikilink"). After you've
    mastered Western style horseback riding, you can learn how to rope
    cattle while
    riding.![](Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Cowgirls spend time on the ranch maneuvering cattle. Using a
        lasso to rope cattle and wrangle them is sometimes necessary.
    -   Often, professional horseback riding coaches will also train you
        how to ride and lasso.
3.  Learn to [barrel race](Barrel_Race "wikilink"). Modern cowgirls
    often participate and compete in rodeos, and barrel racing is the
    most popular event for
    women.![](Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Barrel racing can actually be a money-maker for an experienced
        cowgirl. Some cowgirls even compete in rodeos for millions of
        dollars.
    -   Cowgirls may also compete in cattle-related events like calf and
        steer roping.
    -   Rodeo competitions are for cowgirls at very high skill levels
        only, so if you're just starting out as a cowgirl, don't think
        about entering a competition.
4.  Have fun with it. Being a cowgirl is about hard work, but it is also
    about having
    fun.![](Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Cowgirl_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Remember that horses are also pets, and you can have fun riding
        and caring for them. They offer companionship and love, just
        like any other pet, and can become your new furry best friend.
    -   Going to rodeos, taking lessons, and meeting girls with similar
        interests are all great parts about being a cowgirl. Making new
        friends and having fun doing what you love is a cowgirl
        necessity.
