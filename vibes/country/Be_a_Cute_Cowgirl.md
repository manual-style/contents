Would you like to be a cowgirl? Ride into the horizon on horse-back?
Well just follow these simple and easy steps and you could become
something that belongs "in the wild, wild west!".

## Steps

1.  Have the right clothes. Clothes are a huge deal and play an
    important roll in being a cowgirl. Cowgirls wear light tartan,
    usually red but you can have another color if you really want. Maybe
    some light blue jeans, ripped at the knee and grass stained for
    authenticity. High, shin high, boots with animal prints on them are
    a must and even better if you have the sound cowgirl boots make when
    you walk. Wear a stylish belt, no patterns or color. Maybe a brow or
    a black, it has to be a dark color. You could complete the cowgirl
    look by buying a belt buckle and displaying it so that everyone can
    see its fine beauty.

2.  Make up naturally. A cowgirl's makeup looks natural and they don't
    use too much, not like typical rich, city kids. Wear some light
    foundation maybe some blusher or some lipstick. Don't go over the
    top, make it look like you have no makeup on whatsoever. Natural is
    key to success!

3.  Pay attention to the hair. The hair plays a major part in this so
    pay attention. Most stereotypical cowgirls have huge curly or wavy
    hair but if you have short/straight hair mess it up a bit so it
    looks cute and rebellious.

4.  Play with dirt. Cowgirls are not afraid to get down and dirty. They
    wrestle and play fight but they are very, very picky about
    cleanliness afterward so make sure to perform proper hygiene.

5.  Be loyal with cowboys. Cowgirls are very loyal to their cowboys and
    don't go moseying of and getting other guys. They stick to the one;
    plain and simple. Also they aren't afraid to kick some nasty butt to
    stick up for someone Be fearless but know when to back down, even
    walking away is a strong move.

6.  Keep your own accent. Whatever you do don't fake a southern accent.
    It will make you sound tacky and fake and people will laugh at you.
    Use your real voice, be true don't fake it.

7.  Respect others. Cowgirls are very respectful, they use their
    manners, treat others the way they want to be treated. They are down
    to earth, sweet gals but they are not afraid to stick up for someone
    in a jam. Don't seek revenge either.
