Have seen a lot of "How to Dress Country" or "How to Act Country"
Wikihows lately. Lets just make one thing clear, COUNTRY IS IN YOUR
BLOOD NOT YOUR CLOSET!!!!!!!!!

## Steps

### Backwoods Girl

1.  If you are a backwoods girl, you probably hunt, fish, mud, and ride
    fourwheelers and dirtbikes, and take long walks through the woods.
2.  The "Real" backwoods country girl has shot a gun multiple times and
    has guns in the houseThe "Fake" backwoods country girl probably has
    never shot a gun before
3.  The "Real" backwoods country girl knows how to hunt. This means she
    knows how to field dress a deer, harvest the meat to eat, knows what
    is in season and what is out of season She knows what a good buck
    looks like and what a bad one looks like.The "Fake" backwoods
    country girl probably doesn't hunt. She probably accuses the other
    hunters of killing innocent animals. If she does not do this, she
    would probably spoil the venison or fowl. She would probably not
    know how to tag the deer, or scream at any tactile touch with the
    dead animal.
4.  The "Real" backwoods girl rides a fourwheeler or a dirtbike and
    knows how to take care of it. She knows how many CCs her ride has,
    she knows what the throttle is, what the torque is, and is not
    afraid to get her ride dirty and muddy.The "Fake" backwoods girl
    probably has only ridden a dirtbike once and it was probably not
    even hers. She probably doesn't know how to do something as basic as
    an oil change.
5.  The "Real" Backwoods girl walks in the woods on an almost daily
    basis, and hangs out down by the river. She isn't afraid to get mud
    on her boots, or even walks barefoot in the woods just to be outside
    in nature. The "Fake" backwoods girl probably spends her time inside
    on social media feed and YouTube. She probably owns cowboy boots,
    but refuses to walk in the woods in them, or doesn't even have woods
    to walk in and struts down the street in her pink camo.

### The Farm Girl

1.  If you live on a farm, you are definitely a country girl. No
    questions asked.
2.  The "Real" farm girl spends hours and hours working in the fields
    and tending to her animals. In her spare time she probably is in
    rodeo or showing at the county fair.The "Fake" farm girl probably
    has never even ridden a horse, does not get her hands dirty
    (literally) doing work on the farm planting, mowing, feeding, and
    doing the unmentionable work. She claims she rides but doesn't.

### Things both types of country girls know how to do.

1.  Start a fire.Not just with a match or a lighter, but knows the
    structures of a fire, what you need to make a fire, and kindling.
2.  Drive a ManualIf you are driving a tractor, your tractor is going to
    have manual shift. The same thing as most Jeeps and Trucks. If you
    are driving a truck to haul things around, you need to know how to
    drive it. If you are mowing your fields or oversized yard, you need
    to know how to stick shift.
3.  Plant A GardenAll country girls know how to garden. Whether you have
    fields of crops, or you are growing vegetables and fruits and herbs
    to go with your hunted meat. All country girls know how to plant a
    seed, where the best place to plant it is, the best times to water a
    plant, how to water it, how to harvest it, etc.
4.  PreservingAll hunters and farmers know how to preserve meat, grown
    plants, and baked goods so they will last a long time. Whether it be
    with condamints, or water.
5.  Hooking up a trailerWhether you are hooking up a horse trailer to go
    to the county fair, or competition, or you are going some place to
    ride but don't have room in the back of your truck for an extra
    dirtbike or fourwheeler, or you are hooking up the family pop up
     for some good old camping, a country girl knows how to do these
    things. This means, knowing what type of  hitch to use, the depth of
    the hitch, etc.
6.  If you call yourself country but cannot do at least 4 of these
    things, you probably are acting "fake"

### Wardrobe

1.  If you wear an oversized belt with sparkles and rhinestones, that
    you bought at the mall, you probably aren't country. Because a
    country girl would know that an oversized belt is needed for
    oversized belt buckles, which are won as prizes at the county fair
    and rodeos.
2.  If you buy jeans pre-ripped, you probably aren't country. Jeans are
    common sense clothes. They are sturdy for when you are doing work so
    your legs don't get hurt. They are for when you horse ride and you
    fall and don't scrape up your legs as bad, so you don't hurt your
    legs riding, and so you don't use up nice clothes when hunting or
    walking in the woods. Ripped jeans do not give you the protection
    your legs need.
3.  If you where a flannel shirt but don't work on a farm, and call
    yourself country, you aren't country. Flannel is common sense. It
    keeps you warm when it is cold and cold when it is warm. It is
    durable and comfortable.
4.  Cowboy BootsIf you wear cowboy boots with a steel toe, know that the
    steel toe is there to protect your toe when dropping heavy objects,
    and farm equipment on your foot. Cowboy boots have a low heel for
    when putting heels in the stirrups of a horse so your feet stay and
    don't fall out.

## Tips

-   Being country has nothing to do with liking a certain type of music
-   There is a difference between a cowgirl and a country girl
-   Country does not matter by the types of car you own
-   Country girls use their manners. (Please, Thank You, Ma'am, Sir)
-   Country Girls were taught to be sheepdogs. They don't judge, but
    they don't stand around doing nothing. They defend themselves and
    stand up for what they believe in.

## Warnings

-   No Warnings. Just be careful when calling yourself country. The real
    country people were country before it was cool :-)
