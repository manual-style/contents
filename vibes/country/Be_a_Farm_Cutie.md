## Steps

1.  Style your hair. Try wearing your hair in French braids or ponytails
    with ribbons on them. Wear your hair down with headbands or down
    with twists on the sides. Leave your hair color natural as it
    is.![](Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Get your own fashion. Try some dark wash jeans, and in the warmer
    months, opt for lightweight floral, plaid, and polka dot shirts with
    light coordinating cardigans. In the winter, try pretty, over sized
    sweaters or pastel flannel shirts. As for shoes, look for really
    pretty rain
    boots.![](Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Wear a smudge of makeup. You would only want mascara and lip
    gloss.![](Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Always have school
    spirit.![](Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Work hard in school. Ace all of your
    classes.![](Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Have your own unique personality. Be warm, old fashioned, kind, and
    gentle. Develop a soft spot for animals. Make everyone feel warm and
    welcome around you. Love your family and friends too! Try getting
    them "just because" presents and give lots and lots of love. Do not
    use
    profanity!![](Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
7.  Get involved in sports. Farm, Southern, and country girls love
    sports all the same, especially football. Try cheerleading,
    softball, girl's basketball, etc. If you aren't that athletic, show
    school spirit by at least attending some school
    games.![](Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Master some old-fashioned skills. Pick up hobbies such as sewing or
    crocheting. Learn how to cook the old fashioned and Southern
    way.![](Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Farm_Cutie_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
