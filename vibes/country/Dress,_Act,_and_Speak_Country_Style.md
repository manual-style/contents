## Steps

### Dressing Country

1.  Get the hair. Country hair can be long or short and worn in a simple
    ponytail. Country hair can be any
    style!![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_1.jpg")
    -   Brush your hair every day, no matter how dirty you're going to
        get in the country. Shower every day and keep [good
        hygiene](Maintain_Good_Hygiene "wikilink").
    -   Girls, learn to pull your hair up in a
        [ponytail](Make_a_Ponytail "wikilink"). Gather all your hair
        into one until it looks right and twist a ponytail holder over
        it until the ponytail holds.
2.  Get the right style. A good shirt is a button-up shirt with plaid.
    It can be any color with the plaid style. Orange is highly
    recommended for girls and boys. Denim jeans with a belt if they are
    loose are amazing. Belts are only for if your pants are loose or
    else it will be too
    tight.![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Get a cowboy or cowgirl hat and cowboy or cowgirl boots. They look
    awesome and are very good for the country
    style.![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Be bright and
    happy.![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_4.jpg")

### Acting Country

1.  Listen to country music. It's an important part of acting country
    and adapting a new liking for music. Some popular country singers
    are Carrie Underwood, Taylor Swift (when she was a tiny bit
    younger), Kellie Pickler, Dolly Parton and Garth
    Brooks.![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_5.jpg")
2.  Develop a liking for animals. A lot of country people live with
    animals. Be nice to the animals, take really good care of your pet,
    and do anything you can to help animals that are in danger of going
    extinct.![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_6.jpg")
3.  Learn to ride a horse. This is optional, but good for acting
    country. Lots of country girls and boys like to ride horses and
    horseback riding lessons can help with
    that.![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_7.jpg")
4.  Be hard-working. Country girls and boys aren't the type that go out
    and have fun without getting their work done first! Pitch in around
    the house, be helpful, try to get good grades in school, and do your
    chores.![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_8.jpg")
5.  Be honest. Country girls and boys are usually honest and telling the
    truth is a good thing to
    do!![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_9.jpg")
6.  Wake up early. Lots of country girls and boys wake up from 6:00 A.M.
    This is optional, but better for your system to get an early
    start.![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_10.jpg")
7.  Disconnect. Don't spend as much time on technology as country boys
    and girls are active and out doing things
    more.![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_11.jpg")
8.  [Eat a nutrionally balance
    diet](Maintain_a_Balanced_Diet "wikilink"). Since some country boys
    and girls live on farms or ranches, eat natural foods, such as eggs,
    meat, and homegrown fruits and vegetables. Make sure to drink plenty
    of milk and water as milk provides stronger bones and teeth and
    water helps with health and
    more.![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_12.jpg")

### Speaking Country Style

1.  Have a twang in your voice. Instead of, "You guys rock!", try,
    "Ya'll rock!". Instead of, "I am going to the movies,", try, "Ah am
    going to the
    movies."![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_13.jpg")
2.  Look up videos and listen to songs with country accents. You can
    practice and pick up on the
    vibe!![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_14.jpg")
3.  Practice lots! Practicing makes you better at the voice and helps
    you develop it
    more!![](Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_15.jpg "fig:Dress,_Act,_and_Speak_Country_Style_Step_15.jpg")
