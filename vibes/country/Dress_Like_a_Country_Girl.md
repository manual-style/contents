Whether you're striving for authenticity, visiting the wide open spaces
of rural America, or simply want to inject a new sense of style into
your daily wear, adopting the country girl style can be fun, freeing,
and simple to master. Follow these steps to look as though you've
stepped right off the set of *Nashville*.

## Steps

### Before you Begin

1.  Determine your reasons for adopting a country style. Do you require
    a more utilitarian, functional style? Do you prefer a sexier look to
    hit the club circuit? Is it the wholesomeness of country dress that
    fits your personality? Knowing what your intentions are will help
    you personalize your
    wardrobe.![](Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Start small. A different top, some new boots, or the right skirt
    will put you on the right path. It can be jarring to adopt a new
    look overnight. Ease into it, experiment to find out what works for
    you and what should be left on the sale
    rack.![](Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_2.jpg")

### Building the Outfit

1.  Choose a color scheme. Country style utilizes a lot of reds and
    blues. Lighter colors are usually better in a sunnier climate. Brown
    leather is often better than black. Match, but create contrast. If
    necessary, use a color wheel to determine what works
    best.![](Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_3.jpg")
    -   Darker shades are less suited for warm climates but hide dirt
        well. Plan accordingly.
2.  Wear a simple, casual top. A plain colored tee or a well-fitting
    button-down top are simple and effective. Sleeve length, neckline,
    and material are all factors to consider. Women's tops are highly
    variable, and you can show off as much or as little skin as
    necessary to suit your individual style.[1]

    -   For the tried-and-true cowgirl, nothing beats a snap-button
        plaid or red-and-white checkered shirt. Graphic tees can be
        stylish, but choose a design carefully, and don't make the
        mistake of assuming that a beer logo or a Confederate flag
        automatically makes the wearer country.
3.  Put on a good pair of jeans. Nothing says country quite like blue
    denim. Straight or boot cut jeans work best. Levi's and Wrangler are
    classic western brands that won't break the bank. Gold or white
    threading complements a good pair nicely. Avoid elaborate, flashy
    designs. Jeans with lower rises are a safe choice. High rises are
    more traditional and difficult to pull off in a non-work setting.[2]
    ![](Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_5.jpg")
    -   For an especially hot summer day, opt for a pair of short jean
        shorts.
4.  Try on a dress or skirt. Thin cotton or cotton blends will be the
    most versatile, but denim works here as well, and can be very
    traditional. Light, tan, or pale colors are safe. Floral patterns
    also work well. Skirts should stop an inch or two short of the knee,
    but can occasionally go longer. Long summer dresses can be useful on
    a windy day.[3]

5.  Wear the boots. There's no replacement for cowboy boots. Heels are
    simply too burdensome for trying to navigate through fields of dried
    dung. It's difficult to go wrong with the color and style: tall,
    short, buckle, no buckle, ornate or minimal embroidery all work
    exceptionally well. (Short boots are best worn with shorts or
    skirts, however). Have at least several pairs to swap out in
    different colors and styles. Leather is essential, and plastic
    should be reserved for nights out on the town.[4]
    ![](Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_7.jpg")
    -   You can find boots in just about every price range, but expect
        to pay at least $200 for a quality, lasting pair.

### Completing the Look

1.  Keep your hair long. Straight, wavy, curly, it doesn't matter.
    Solid, natural colors only. No
    highlights.![](Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_8.jpg")
2.  Accessorize. For jewelry, try a pair of tasteful chandelier or stud
    earrings in both classic and unique styles, and a matching cross
    necklace. Gold works as well as silver. Bandanas are versatile and
    instantly, recognizably
    country.![](Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Don't commit the sin of too much jewelry. You shouldn't be
        inviting comparisons to Mr. T.
3.  Cowboy hats are optional. So are belts featuring large
    buckles.![](Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_10.jpg")
4.  Apply a tinted moisturizer in lieu of foundation. Apply a coral
    blush with a slight bronze undertone for a sunkissed look on the
    apples of your cheeks. Apply one coat of brown mascara and a sheer
    lip gloss. No heavy eyeliner. Black mascara is fine. For eyeliner,
    use something that will highlight your eyes. If you have blue eyes,
    use black or navy blue. For green, use brown or an emerald color.
    For brown, brown or black works
    great!![](Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_11.jpg")
    -   Just as with jewelry, keep it tasteful and understated.
5.  Don't overdo the perfume. A couple sprays is plenty. Country girls
    have a light, flowery
    smell.![](Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Country_Girl_Step_12.jpg")

## Tips

-   Never underestimate the power of pride, confidence, a disarming
    demeanor, and a warm smile.
-   Borrow from the icons. Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood, Connie
    Britton, Kellie Pickler, Dolly Parton, Miranda Lambert, Fay Hield,
    and Laura Bell Bundy all exemplify country in their own way.
-   Go further than skin deep. Open yourself to new opportunities and
    experiences to embody the country lifestyle. Country clothing was
    made to be worn outdoors.
-   Take a trip to fashionable Southern locales to pick up on dress and
    mannerisms of the region. Nashville, Atlanta, and Dallas all feature
    distinctive styles.
-   Use the internet. Sites like Polyvore, Chictopia, Pinterest, and
    Tumblr are all great resources for visualizing limitless outfit
    combinations.
-   Country girls don't usually wear big earrings. You should wear
    studs, crosses, or small hearts. Don't have a wardrobe full of pink
    camo. Camo is only good for hunting. Tennis shoes are fine to have.
    Remember above all country girls like to keep things simple.
