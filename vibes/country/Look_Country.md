When putting together a country-themed outfit, there’s a fine line
between modern touches of country style and Grand Ole Opry caricature.
So how can you dress with a country flair without going full-on Dolly
Parton? Use these tips and tricks to carry off a stylish look with just
the right amount of country inspiration.

## Steps

### Looking Country for Men

1.  Look for the right bottoms. Country style is all about the jean, but
    jeans aren’t your only option for
    bottoms.![](Look_Country_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   For men, jeans are definitely the primary option for
        bottom-wear, but dark-colored jeans or corduroys can also be
        part of a country-inspired look, particularly if you’re trying
        to dress up your look.
    -   When looking for pants, look for a close fit with legs just wide
        enough to accommodate some cowboy boots. No skinny jeans or
        baggy pants.
2.  Find the perfect shirt. Certain cuts and prints unequivocally evoke
    country style--your job is just to choose
    one.![](Look_Country_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Long-sleeved button-down shirts are as much an integral part of
        the country look as blue jeans. If you want a country-inspired
        look for your shirt, look for plaid, embroidered, or checkered
        button-down shirts.
    -   If you want to dress up your country look, go for button-down
        shirts with pearl snap buttons.
3.  Put a hat on it. Cowboy hats are easily the most classically
    identifiable feature of a country-inspired
    look.![](Look_Country_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   For men, simple, solid colored felt or straw cowboy hats are the
        go-to. Some hats might include some subtle detailing, but
        generally you want to aim for simplicity.
    -   To get the right fit, look for a hat that fits one to two
        finger-widths above the eyebrows and ears and sits securely, but
        not too snugly, around your head.
    -   A nice, clean, crisp cowboy hat works for a dressed-up look as
        well.
4.  Find your footwear. Of course the most country-inspired footwear for
    both men and women is the cowboy
    boot.![](Look_Country_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   The boot style of choice for men is your standard roper boot
        with a flat heel and square or rounded toes (pointed toes are
        somewhat of a no-no in certain circles).[1]
    -   If you’re going out, wear a dark-colored pair of clean,
        sharp-looking boots.
5.  Get your belt on. Thick leather belts with chunky belt buckles are
    important center pieces of country-inspired
    style.![](Look_Country_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Black or brown leather belts with a chunky silver buckle are
        staples of country style. More elaborate belts may feature studs
        or tooled leather, but often the buckle is the true star.
    -   Big, unmistakable belt buckles are one of the more fun aspects
        of country style, but use some restraint when going that route.
        If you’re going to wear a loud buckle, tone down the rest of the
        outfit to avoid looking overdone or costumey.
    -   If you already have several distinctly country-style elements in
        your outfit (fringed vest or skirt, pearl-snap shirt, etc.), opt
        for a more toned-down belt and buckle. An understated
        three-piece silver buckle, for example, adds country appeal
        without overwhelming the outfit.
6.  Pick the right jewelry. When it comes to country style, silver is
    always the
    go-to.![](Look_Country_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   The jewelry options for men are generally fewer than for women.
        When looking for jewelry, opt for chunky silver rings or perhaps
        a more subtle silver necklace.
    -   As an alternative to jewelry, a bandana worn tied around the
        neck or folded into a shirt pocket can give a taste of country
        to an otherwise plain outfit.
7.  Throw on a vest or jacket. The right vest or jacket can add subtle
    country style to an outfit, so keep an eye out for flattering
    styles.![](Look_Country_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Look for a country-inspired sport or leather jacket to add a bit
        of edge to an everyday ensemble.
    -   Wearing a nice classically cut vest can also be a good option if
        you’re dressing up a bit for a night out.
8.  Keep your hair simple. Men’s hairstyles are about as simple as it
    gets: short and basic cuts are the way to
    go.![](Look_Country_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Because country style is about the hat more than the hair, a
        country-inspired hairstyle should be something that works easily
        with and doesn’t steal any thunder from a cowboy hat.

### Looking Country for Women

1.  Look for the right pants or skirt. Women have a few more options in
    this realm than men, including skirts and
    shorts.![](Look_Country_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Jeans are still the classic choice when it comes to a country
        aesthetic, though the jeans for women are often a bit flashier
        than their male counterparts. Studs and sparkles on the front
        and/or back pockets are popular with the younger and trendier
        country fashion set, and close-fitting, curve-hugging boot-cut
        jeans are preferred.
    -   Short-shorts, cut-off denim shorts, denim skirts (long and
        short), and floral, flowy skirts are all options as well. Bonus
        points if they come in American flag or hunting camo print.
2.  Choose the right shirt. Women’s tops feature diverse colors, styles,
    and prints. Some prints, like rustic florals, plaids, or embroidery,
    are a particularly identifiable as
    country-inspired.![](Look_Country_Step_10.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_10.jpg")
    -   Long-sleeved button-downs are also the most classically country
        option, though rolling the sleeves of your long-sleeved shirt is
        a commonly acceptable element of the country look.
3.  Wear a loose, airy dress. Country style favors airy summer-style
    dresses that have a loose sway to
    them.![](Look_Country_Step_11.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_11.jpg")
    -   Choose a dress with a loose fit or with a bodice and flowing
        skirt. Both fit the classic country profile.
    -   Look for dresses with light, floral prints, studded or fringed
        detail, lace, or leather belted accents.[2]
    -   If you’ll be going out, look for a dress with particularly nice
        embroidery detail and/or beading.
4.  Get some great boots. For women, the choice of cowboy boots is
    nearly endless and covers a range of styles, from tooled leather
    boots with a squared-off toe to floral embroidered boots with a
    pointed toe. Have fun mixing cowboy boots with dresses, skirts, and
    jeans to add a taste of country to otherwise standard
    outfits.![](Look_Country_Step_12.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_12.jpg")
    -   There’s some debate as to whether boots can be worn over rather
        than under jeans. The more style avant-garde have opted to
        experiment with wearing your boots over your pants, but if you
        want to play it a little safer, stick to wearing your pants over
        your boots.
    -   If you’d prefer to expand beyond boots, flip-flops and sandals
        with studs, charms, and sparkles are also options.
    -   If you’re going out, you can pair a nice set of cowboy boots
        with a nicer dress for a more casual elegant look, or you can
        opt for a pair of boots with a higher heel, higher shaft, and/or
        finer detailing to dress up a look.
5.  Get yourself a hat. A cowboy hat will instantly countrify any
    ensemble and can be a lot of fun to
    wear.![](Look_Country_Step_13.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_13.jpg")
    -   The cowboy hat options for women are largely the same as for
        men--felt or straw, solid colors--but there’s a bit more leeway
        in terms of adornment.
    -   Women’s hats may include more elaborate studded details,
        turquoise accents, or rhinestones for added flash.
    -   If you’re dressing up for a night out, it’s best to leave the
        hat behind. Unlike for men, cowboy hats will most likely dress
        down a woman’s outfit. Opt instead to wear your hair up or in
        loose waves.
6.  Wear a bandana. Bandanas are conventionally associated with the
    country look because cowboys and ranchers would wear them on trail
    rides to keep dust out of their noses and mouths, but modern country
    fashion now incorporates bandanas in a range of
    ways.![](Look_Country_Step_14.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_14.jpg")
    -   Wearing a bandana loosely tied around your neck or over your
        hair can add a touch of country whimsy.
    -   You can also look for bandana-print shirts, skirts, and dresses
        that pay homage to cowboy style.
7.  Find a great belt. Women’s belts come in two main styles: classic
    and modern. Classic belts are worn through your belt loops, while
    modern belts are meant to be seen and are worn over shirts, dresses,
    etc.![](Look_Country_Step_15.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_15.jpg")
    -   Adding a classic belt with a chunky buckle to a pair of jeans or
        shorts gives an instant country feel to most any outfit. Wearing
        a thick belt with a large buckle over a button-down shirt or
        loose sweater is a more modern way to embrace country style.
    -   Big elaborate belt buckles are definitely a fun part of country
        style, but use some restraint if you go with a statement belt
        buckle. Tone down the rest of the outfit to avoid looking
        overdone or costumey. That is, if you already have several
        distinctly country-style elements in your outfit (fringed vest
        or skirt, a cowboy hat, etc.), opt for a belt with a more subtle
        buckle.
    -   A classic three-piece silver buckle, for example, can add
        country appeal without overwhelming the outfit.
8.  Add some jewelry. When it comes to country-inspired jewelry, go
    chunky or go
    home.![](Look_Country_Step_16.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_16.jpg")
    -   Look for chunky silver jewelry, especially with turquoise
        accents and floral motifs.[3]
    -   As with belt buckles, don’t go overboard with your jewelry
        choices. If you opt to wear a big statement piece of jewelry and
        keep the rest of your outfit somewhat subdued to avoid looking
        overdone.
9.  Throw on a vest or jacket. Depending on the vest or jacket, it can
    add anything from a subtle hint of country inspiration to
    unmistakable country flair to an
    outfit.![](Look_Country_Step_17.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_17.jpg")
    -   For women, loose, fringed vests can add major vintage
        country-chic to an outfit,[4] while denim jackets can bring
        casual country flair to a dress or skirt.
10. Keep your hair simple. For the most part, country-style hair is
    simple--the old-school mountain of teased hair has long since been
    eclipsed by more stripped-down modern
    styles.![](Look_Country_Step_18.jpg "fig:Look_Country_Step_18.jpg")
    -   Feminine styles are the way to go. Long, loose waves work well
        alone or under a cowboy hat for a soft, romantic look, while
        side braids and low ponytails work similarly well under hats.

## Tips

-   If it features American-flag print, it will work with country style.
-   Plaid can't go wrong with this look.
-   Be sure you find pants that are long enough to cover the tops of
    your boots when you sit.
-   If you’re going with fringe, stick to one fringed accessory at a
    time--any more and you risk looking a bit cheesy.[5]
