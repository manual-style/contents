Movies, television, and even books have kept the cowboy style part of
our popular culture for well over a century. Generally valuing function
and comfort over aesthetics, our American cowboy is heavily influenced
by the Mexican and Spanish *vaquero*[1] term which were the original
cowboys of the past. There are a number of things you can do to adopt
the cowboy style as your own. Just how cowboy you want to go is up to
you but everyone can find something they like about being a cowboy.

## Steps

### The Basic Cowboy Look

The basic cowboy look includes the bare essentials – all the must-have
items that immediately say “Cowboy” to anyone who passes you on the
street.

1.  Get a pair of boots. One of the most identifiable elements of the
    cowboy style is a good leather boot with a hard wooden heel (Not
    actually wooden, is stacked leather). They can take some getting
    used to, since the heels and sharp toes are designed for fitting a
    \[stirrup\] on horseback. If you’re the kind of cowboy who doesn’t
    use his boots for much more than walking down the street, there are
    plenty of intricate and comfortable designs
    available.[2]![](Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_8.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_8.jpg")
2.  Slip on a pair of jeans. When a cowboy is working, he needs pants
    that are both comfortable and durable. Most cowboys favor simple
    jeans, with straight legs or boot
    cuts.![](Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_4.jpg")
3.  Don a hat. A hat is more than just an accessory for a cowboy – it
    performs essential functions. A cowboy hat is traditionally worn to
    keep a cowboy’s head cool, to keep the sun off of his face, and to
    keep flying dirt out of his eyes. Fancy designer hats are readily
    available, but a real cowboy prefers an old, worn in hat, whose
    shape has been formed only over years of hard and constant use. For
    a true cowboy hat, look for the Stetson or Bailey brands. Choose a
    beaver fur felt hat for cold weather, and a straw hat for the warmer
    seasons.[3]![](Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_1.jpg")

### The Advanced Cowboy Look

The advanced cowboy look takes a little more commitment – and a little
more courage. Not for the faint of heart, these additions to the basic
cowboy look will make you stand out in a crowd.

1.  Wear a Western style shirt. To advance your cowboy look, find a
    long-sleeved, button-down shirt, preferably with a plaid pattern.
    Thicker shirts, of course, can be worn in winter, and thinner shirts
    when it’s warm. Some cowboys do opt for a simple T-shirts, but
    rarely while working in the sun. Either way, the look should be
    rugged. Designer cowboy shirts might include some light embroidery,
    or a chest flap that snaps closed on one
    side.[4]![](Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_7.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_7.jpg")
2.  Get a good belt and an even better buckle. Many cowboys prefer wide
    leather belts with large metal buckles, which are often made of
    silver or brass. These may have "western" themes, or the cowboy’s
    initials, or they may just advertise for a favorite tobacco or beer
    company.![](Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_5.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_5.jpg")
3.  Grow a mustache or a beard. Cowboys are like any other group of
    people - some wear facial hair, some don't. But working cowboys, who
    are often on the job from sun-up to sundown, don’t have much time
    for
    shaving.![](Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_2.jpg")

### The Extreme Cowboy Look

If you opt for this look, your life is probably already pretty cowboy.
Out in the rest of the world, you’re sure to turn lots of heads.

1.  Go outside. Cowboys work outdoors, not in corporate offices, so
    their skin is tan, leathery, and coarse from wind and sun, which
    they often see twelve hours a day, six or even seven days a
    week.![](Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_9.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_9.jpg")
2.  Skip the manicure. Cowboys don't spend a lot of time working on
    their fingernails, or trying to keep their hands baby-smooth and
    soft. Cowboy work makes for rough callouses and dirty nails. Cuts,
    bruises, and scars are regular sights on hands that spend their time
    working with fences, lassos, horseshoes, and other rough
    materials.![](Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_10.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_10.jpg")
3.  Get a duster. A duster is a long leather jacket, usually with large
    buttons, and sometimes with fringe in various spots. The duster is
    most appropriate during cold weather or while traveling. Like most
    things cowboy, the larger buttons are practical – they’re much
    easier to use with gloves on. A sturdy leather vest is a good
    substitute when the weather is
    warm.![](Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Strap on the chaps. Chaps are perhaps the most extreme of all the
    cowboy wear. Chaps provide extra protection and while working on
    horseback and at the rodeo.[5] It’s not advisable to wear chaps in
    many other settings. The same probably goes for
    spurs.![](Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_6.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Cowboy_Step_6.jpg")

## Tips

-   Learn to be a gentleman who respects people, nature and animals.
-   Don't be afraid to get your clothes dirty. Theres never been a real
    cowboy with clean clothes, especially boots.
-   Wear a cowboy hat or keep one in your truck
-   Cowboys don't wear large clothes. Due to their work routine, tight
    jeans fit better for them.
-   Get out and meet some real cowboys, not just actors. You’ll find
    great things that will help you move past the stereotypes.
-   Learn to ride a horse. It’ll break your clothes in, help get them
    dirty with dust and it’s just plain fun.
-   Develop your own style. Just because cowboys aren’t overly concerned
    with style, doesn’t mean they don’t have likes and dislikes, or that
    they all look the same.
-   Attend a local rodeo. Events such as the Big City 'Stampedes'
    (Houston, Calgary etc), NFR's and the PBR's have more Urban and
    Wannabe Cowboys than actual 'working' cowboys.
-   Don’t call yourself a cowboy. Most cowboys don’t use the name much.
    And even if they do, they’ve earned the name.
