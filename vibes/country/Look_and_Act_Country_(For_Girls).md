Country fashion is comfortable, neat and stylish all rolled into one.
Add in country grace and manners, and it's a style many are opting to
adopt, showing off openly their love of and pride for all things
country.

## Steps

### Getting the country fashion style

1.  Find some "country looking" clothes. Wearing denim (jean material)
    is always good and slightly loose jeans. Most importantly, country
    girls like looking casual and comfy, and they don't wear really
    tight clothing.
    ![](Look-Country-Step-5-Version-3.jpg "fig:Look-Country-Step-5-Version-3.jpg")
    -   Choose plaid shirts. These can be sourced from anywhere, such
        Walmart, online, etc.
    -   Wear plain colored shirts, or shirts with minimal designs.
        Country girls don't go "all out" with wacky patterns.
    -   Another country thing is "Guy Harvey shirts."
2.  Try to get a pair of hard sole shoes. For example: cowgirl boots,
    they are always nice to have and get a pair of rubber boots in case
    you want to work outside.

    -   Take your shoes off when you have a chance; bare feet are also
        acceptable for the country style.
3.  Get utilitarian gear. Every country guy or girl owns camo for
    hunting. She also owns a pair of good boots, either for riding,
    show, work, or
    hunting.![](Choose-an-Airsoft-Sniper-Rifle-Step-4-Version-2.jpg "fig:Choose-an-Airsoft-Sniper-Rifle-Step-4-Version-2.jpg")
4.  Look for country brands. At your local western store, they'll have
    brands like Dixie Girls and Guy Harvey. Be sure to buy both casual
    and show clothes, style very being country too! Be sure to find your
    signature look. Also you can visit cabelas.com countrygirlstore.com
    drysdales.com cavenders.com for more clothing
    options.![](Look-Country-Step-15.jpg "fig:Look-Country-Step-15.jpg")
5.  Choose suitable accessories. Country girls are actually very
    girlish. When accessorizing, choose shiny things. Pink is also
    okay.![](Look-Country-Step-14.jpg "fig:Look-Country-Step-14.jpg")
6.  For girls, country girls usually wear minimal make-up. A small bit
    of eye liner, lip balm, and one to two coats of mascara (if you
    already have dark eye lashes, skip the eye liner) is the most you'll
    need. Cover up is okay too if you really need it. Don't overdo it,
    or else you'll look too preppy and people will think you're a
    poser.![](Be-Like-Spencer-Hastings-from-Pretty-Little-Liars-Step-3-Version-2.jpg "fig:Be-Like-Spencer-Hastings-from-Pretty-Little-Liars-Step-3-Version-2.jpg")

### Being country

1.  Be proud to be a country girl. When people say, "I hate the
    country," don't get flustered or upset, but be friendly and act
    nice, so others would have nothing to hold against
    you.![](Avoid-Being-Pressured-Into-Sex-Step-6.jpg "fig:Avoid-Being-Pressured-Into-Sex-Step-6.jpg")
2.  Be thoughtful, kind and pleasant towards others. Personality
    matters. You don't need to have an accent to be country, but you
    need to act like you're southern. Be happy/bubbly (even if you're
    having a bad day) and smile at everyone. Use southern hospitality,
    and plenty of
    niceness.![](Fall-in-Love-With-a-Nice-Person-Step-6-Version-2.jpg "fig:Fall-in-Love-With-a-Nice-Person-Step-6-Version-2.jpg")
3.  Use your manners. Always say "please" and "thank you". Always say
    "yes ma'am" or "no
    ma'am".![](Determine-Why-Someone-Is-Treating-You-Poorly-Step-6-Version-2.jpg "fig:Determine-Why-Someone-Is-Treating-You-Poorly-Step-6-Version-2.jpg")
4.  Reach out to others. Country girls have big hearts. They love
    volunteering and helping their community. And they love their
    country.![](Help-Flood-Victims-Step-5.jpg "fig:Help-Flood-Victims-Step-5.jpg")
    -   Feed the homeless. Take along your home grown and baked produce.

### Pursuing country activities

1.  Learn the country music. Every country girl loves to listen to and
    play country music.First of all,learning to play the guitar is the
    right way to play country
    music.![](Be_a_Country_Singer_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Country_Singer_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Pursue activities and sports that country girls usually like. These
    include watching and playing football, fishing, and Mudding. This
    doesn't mean they can't be girlish though! Girlishness actually
    complements your country girl
    attitude.![](Cast-a-Fly-Fishing-Rod-Step-8-Version-2.jpg "fig:Cast-a-Fly-Fishing-Rod-Step-8-Version-2.jpg")
3.  If you're old enough to drive, a truck or Jeep Wrangler is the most
    "country you can get," "jackin" it up too (getting lifts). i.e. Ford
    F150, GMC Sierra, Chevy S10, Bronco,
    Blazer.![](Make-Your-Truck-Be-Cool-Step-4.jpg "fig:Make-Your-Truck-Be-Cool-Step-4.jpg")
4.  If you're in high-school, take shop and/or agriculture and FFA is a
    good club to join too. Also, if you're not in high school(or just
    don't want to join high school clubs, check out girl scouts or a 4H
    club in your
    area)![](Console-Someone-Who-Had-a-Miscarriage-Step-20.jpg "fig:Console-Someone-Who-Had-a-Miscarriage-Step-20.jpg")
5.  Country people are also hard workers and love to get dirty. Go
    outside and mow the lawn or help your dad on the car
    etc.![](Drive-a-Tractor-Step-6.jpg "fig:Drive-a-Tractor-Step-6.jpg")
6.  Learn to cook. The kitchen is the most sacred place in the house.
    Country folks love to cook from fried food, smoked food, breakfast,
    and
    dessert.![](Cook-a-Deer-Roast-in-a-Slow-Cooker-Step-20.jpg "fig:Cook-a-Deer-Roast-in-a-Slow-Cooker-Step-20.jpg")

### Compassionate country

1.  Learn to love animals. Just about every country girl loves horses.
    Dogs and cats make good pets, in pairs or threes. If you've lots of
    space, consider fostering animals
    too.![](Break-a-Horse-Step-11-Version-3.jpg "fig:Break-a-Horse-Step-11-Version-3.jpg")
2.  Treat your man right. If you want to date a country man, make sure
    you treat him great and with respect. But don't be his doormat.
    Never take any crap from him, and make sure he treats you with just
    as much respect. If he doesn't, he's not worth a girl like
    you.![](Help-Someone-Overcome-a-Heroin-Addiction-Step-7-Version-2.jpg "fig:Help-Someone-Overcome-a-Heroin-Addiction-Step-7-Version-2.jpg")

## Tips

-   Don't be afraid to get dirty.
-   Acceptance into the "country" group is not quick or easy, so be
    patient. Most have known each other their whole lives.
-   Don't change who you are! This is simply a guide, not a set of
    rules. You can tweak this as well.
-   Sing country music or just listen to it, it will show people your
    true colors!

## Warnings

-   If you are a city girl, it may be hard to change. Make sure the
    change is slow, or else you may be seen as a poser. People will
    notice a big change if you switch too fast, and will think "that's
    weird she is being something she's not."
