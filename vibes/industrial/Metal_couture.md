**Metal couture** is a type of adornment or
[fashion](fashion "wikilink") item, made of [metal](metal "wikilink"),
generally made as [art](art "wikilink"), for [fashion
photography](fashion_photography "wikilink") or high-end couture
[catwalk](catwalk "wikilink"). The pieces are generally larger and more
significant than [jewellery](jewellery "wikilink"), and are generally
worn (either as headpieces or more like clothing), rather than
decorating the body like jewellery. In differentiating metal couture
from jewellery, as one-off pieces, and generally not practical or useful
for the wearer, they are more akin to art,[1] than a standard item of
jewellery. They may cover the torso, the neck, the head, or any part of
the body. While they can be defined as "a form of jewellery",[2] they
can also simply be defined as "fashion designs made from metal".[3][4]
Metal couture can stretch the concept of what is basically metal art, to
the point that the metal becomes clothing, somewhat but not exactly the
same as wearable art.[5]

[Designers](Designers "wikilink") who create metal couture may be called
"metal couturiers" or "metal couture designers". The designers generally
come from a background in jewellery, or in some cases, may have skills
in some other form of [sheet metal](sheet_metal "wikilink") work, for
example the skills used to decorate and create historical metal
[armour](armour "wikilink").

Because of the size of the pieces, they are generally not made of
[precious metal](precious_metal "wikilink") as jewellery would be, as
this would make them prohibitively expensive. Various types of
[metal](metal "wikilink") are used for making metal couture, including
[steel](steel "wikilink"), [stainless
steel](stainless_steel "wikilink"), [copper](copper "wikilink"),
[aluminium](aluminium "wikilink"), but may include other materials.
Metal couture was first featured in [fashion
shows](fashion_shows "wikilink") in the early 2000s, in both mainstream,
high-end couture and [alternative
fashion](alternative_fashion "wikilink")/[subcultural](subcultural "wikilink")
fashion shows.[6][7]

Some metal couture has featured in product promotional photography,
[stage shows](stage_show "wikilink"), [art
installations](art_installations "wikilink") and the
[catwalk](catwalk "wikilink"). Other items have featured in
[film](film "wikilink"),[8] stage, and the video clips of performers
including [Beyoncé](Beyoncé "wikilink") and [Lady
Gaga](Lady_Gaga "wikilink").[9][10][11][12]

An early metal couturier was [Paco Rabanne](Paco_Rabanne "wikilink"),
who used metal in [clothing](clothing "wikilink") for his designs, for
[film](film "wikilink") and major fashion labels in the 1960s.[13] Other
metal couture designers include [Spain](Spain "wikilink")'s Manual
Albarann, who has had his work featured in cinema
(*[Maleficent](Maleficent_(film) "wikilink")*), on stage and in [music
videos](music_video "wikilink"). The jeweller William Griffiths has
featured metal couture, including metal underwear and metal corsetry, in
fashion shows in London and Melbourne.[14] Laurel De Witt's label
Laureluxe has featured her work in a number of fashion shows in New
York.[15][16] Melbourne-based Bernard Lyons, under the label Assassinus,
has had metal couture designs featured regularly in [alternative
fashion](alternative_fashion "wikilink") shows in
[Australia](Australia "wikilink") since 2005.[17][18] Jared Holland's
Exosthetik studio in [Auckland](Auckland "wikilink"), [New
Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink"), specialising in complex electrolytic
etching, has featured his work in fashion shows and made pieces for the
music industry.
