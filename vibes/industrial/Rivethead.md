A **rivethead** or **rivet head** is a person associated with the
[industrial dance music](industrial_dance_music "wikilink") scene.[1] In
stark contrast to the original [industrial
culture](Industrial_music "wikilink"), whose performers and
heterogeneous audience were sometimes referred to as "industrialists",
the rivethead scene is a coherent [youth
culture](youth_culture "wikilink") closely linked to a discernible
fashion style. The scene emerged in the late 1980s[2] on the basis of
[electro-industrial](electro-industrial "wikilink"),
[EBM](Electronic_body_music "wikilink"), and [industrial
rock](Industrial_metal "wikilink") music. The associated dress style
draws on military fashion and [punk
aesthetics](Punk_fashion "wikilink")[3] with hints of [fetish
wear](fetish_fashion "wikilink"), mainly inspired by the scene's musical
protagonists.

## Origins of the term

Initially, the term *rivethead* had been used since the 1940s as a
nickname for North American [automotive](Automotive_industry "wikilink")
[assembly line](assembly_line "wikilink")[4] and steel construction
workers[5] and hit the mainstream through the publication of [Ben
Hamper](Ben_Hamper "wikilink")'s *Rivethead: Tales From the Assembly
Line*,[6] which is otherwise unrelated to the subculture.

Glenn Chase, founder of San Diego label [Re-Constriction
Records](Re-Constriction_Records "wikilink"), is responsible for the
term's meaning in the 1990s.[7] In 1993, he released *Rivet Head
Culture*, a compilation that contains several electro-industrial and
industrial rock acts from the American [underground
music](underground_music "wikilink") scene. In the same year, industrial
rock group [Chemlab](Chemlab "wikilink") − whose members were close
friends of Chase − had released their debut album *[Burn Out at the
Hydrogen Bar](Burn_Out_at_the_Hydrogen_Bar "wikilink")*,[8] which
includes a track called *Rivet Head*. Chemlab singer Jared Louche said
he did not remember where the term came from, although he stated that
this song title was in his mind for years.[9]

## Music

The rivethead scene is remotely related but not directly connected to
the industrial music culture. [Industrial
music](Industrial_music "wikilink") is a genre of experimental and
avantgardist music, intertwined with graphical visualization (mostly
with disturbing graphical content).[10] The absence of conventional song
structures, such as rhythm and melody, is a main characteristic of the
genre, whereas the music preferred by the rivethead scene includes
several danceable and song-oriented styles that are sometimes considered
*"post-industrial"*.[11] Like [post-punk](post-punk "wikilink"), the
term *post-industrial* describes a musical genre that developed
distinctly from its roots and turned into several strands of sound,
namely [electro-industrial](electro-industrial "wikilink"), [electronic
body music](electronic_body_music "wikilink"), and [industrial
rock](Industrial_metal "wikilink"), often referred to as [industrial
dance music](industrial_dance_music "wikilink"). Those styles differ
from traditional industrial music regarding aesthetics, sound, and
production techniques.[12][13]

## Aesthetics

The rivethead dress style has been inspired by
[military](military "wikilink") [aesthetics](aesthetic "wikilink"),
complemented by fashion "that mimics the grit and grime of industrial
sectors in major metropolitan areas"*.*[14] Additionally, it borrows
elements of punk fashion, such as a fanned and dyed [Mohawk
hairstyle](Mohawk_hairstyle "wikilink"),[15] and [fetish
wear](fetish_fashion "wikilink") such as black leather and PVC tops,
pants and shorts (primarily worn by females), partly supplemented with
[modern primitive](modern_primitive "wikilink") body modifications such
as [tattoos](tattoo "wikilink") and
[piercings](Body_piercing "wikilink").

Occasionally, rivetheads emphasize a
[post-apocalyptic](Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction "wikilink"),
[dystopian](dystopia "wikilink") influence, often inspired by movies,
e.g. *[Mad Max](Mad_Max "wikilink")* (1979), *[Escape from New
York](Escape_from_New_York "wikilink")* (1981),
*[Gunhed](Gunhed_(film) "wikilink")* (1989), *[Death
Machine](Death_Machine "wikilink")* (1994), and *[Strange
Days](Strange_Days_(film) "wikilink")* (1995). Several movies, such as
*[Hardware](Hardware_(film) "wikilink")* (1990), *Strange Days* and
*[Johnny Mnemonic](Johnny_Mnemonic_(film) "wikilink")* (1995), feature
music tracks by [Ministry](Ministry_(band) "wikilink"),
[KMFDM](KMFDM "wikilink"), [Diatribe](Diatribe_(band) "wikilink"),
[Stabbing Westward](Stabbing_Westward "wikilink") and other bands
associated with the rivethead culture.[16][17][18] Other influences
include sci-fi archetypes such as [Lupus
Yonderboy](Lupus_Yonderboy "wikilink") of the [Panther
Moderns](Neuromancer "wikilink") and
[Razorgirl](Molly_Millions "wikilink") from the
[cyberpunk](cyberpunk "wikilink") literature (characters from the
[Sprawl trilogy](Sprawl_trilogy "wikilink") by [William
Gibson](William_Gibson "wikilink")). ![](Sascha.jpg "fig:Sascha.jpg"),
one of the most influential persons in the rivethead music scene since
the 1990s, both musically and visually.\]\]

Below some basic characteristics of the rivethead dress style. As a
divergence from the extravagance of youth cultures such as [New
Romantic](New_Romanticism "wikilink"),
[goth](Goth_subculture "wikilink"), [cyber](Cybergoth "wikilink"), and
[steampunk](steampunk "wikilink"), the idea is to make a statement with
as few fashion components as possible. The rivethead look commonly is
unadorned and epitomizes a direct reflection of the social environment
("street survival wear"[19]).

### Male

-   **Tops**: Black, gray or olive [tank
    tops](Sleeveless_shirt#A-shirt "wikilink"),[20]Jonathan S. Epstein /
    David A. Locher: *Youth Culture. Identity in a postmodern world*,
    Wiley-Blackwell Publishers, 1998, , p. 115
    </ref>

    plain [t-shirts](t-shirt "wikilink"), band shirts, sleeveless shirts
    (sometimes with the sleeves ripped off),
    [tie-dye](tie-dye "wikilink") crinkle or burst pattern shirts; black
    [leather jackets](leather_jacket "wikilink") (frequently painted
    with band [logos](logo "wikilink")), and MA-1 [flight
    jackets](flight_jacket "wikilink").[21]
-   **Pants**: [Cargo](Cargo_pants "wikilink") and
    [BDU](Battle_Dress_Uniform "wikilink") paratrooper pants, ripped
    jeans, vintage shorts, often but not always black or [Woodland
    camouflage](M81_Woodland "wikilink"); usually tucked into boots,
    rolled at the bottom cuffs or worn as cut-off shorts. Black leather
    pants and bondage pants are sometimes worn.[22]
-   **Footwear**: [Combat boots](Combat_boot "wikilink"),[23][24]
    [steel-toe boots](steel-toe_boots "wikilink") or low shoes, such as
    [Dr. Martens](Dr._Martens "wikilink"), Gripfasts,
    [Grinders](Grinders_(footwear) "wikilink") and Underground shoes.
-   **Hair**: Partially shaved
    ([undercut](Undercut_(hairstyle) "wikilink")),
    [flattop](flattop "wikilink"), [Mohawk](Mohawk_hairstyle "wikilink")
    or completely [shaved](head_shaving "wikilink"). Sometimes long hair
    in combination with undercut or [dreadlocks](dreadlocks "wikilink").
-   **Accessories**: [Teashades](Teashades "wikilink") and [Ray-Ban
    Aviator](Ray-Ban_Aviator "wikilink") sunglasses. Battle Dress
    Uniform-style or military belts; bracelets and [dog
    tags](dog_tag "wikilink"); fingerless leather gloves; sometimes
    jewelry that incorporates industrial elements such as nails, screws
    and cogs. Suspenders, or "braces", normally worn hanging off
    trousers or shorts.
-   **Body modification**: Primarily piercings and tattoos.

### Female

Rivetgirls may dress along with the *[femme
fatale](femme_fatale "wikilink")* look:
[sexuality](Human_sexuality "wikilink") as power. Common are fetish
wear, such as black [PVC](Polyvinyl_chloride "wikilink") and
[leather](leather "wikilink") [corsages](Corsage_(bodice) "wikilink"),
[miniskirts](miniskirt "wikilink"), ankle-deep or knee-high [stiletto
heel](stiletto_heel "wikilink") boots;[25] less makeup than Goths[26]
and 1980s New Wave fashion girls, who were also an influence on the
late-1980s/early 1990s rivetgirl style (cf. fishnet tights, stilettos,
Dr. Martens low boots). Often dyed hair (black, sometimes red or blonde)
that is long, short, spiked, partially shaved (see [Maria
Azevedo](Maria_Azevedo "wikilink") of
[Battery](Battery_(electro-industrial_band) "wikilink")[27] and Yone
Dudas of [Decoded Feedback](Decoded_Feedback "wikilink")[28]) or
dreadlocked (see Anna Christine of Luxt[29]). On the other hand, the
female rivethead fashion look may be and often is identical to the tough
style of the male rivetheads ([Tank Girl](Tank_Girl "wikilink")
aesthetic; military wear[30] such as tank tops, paratrooper pants and
combat boots[31]). Kim X, co-founder of California-based music label
[COP International](COP_International "wikilink"), compared the female
rivethead attitude to the [Riot grrrl](Riot_grrrl "wikilink")
movement.[32]

## Comparison with goth subculture

The rivethead scene of the 1980s and 1990s was different from the [goth
subculture](goth_subculture "wikilink") in ideological and musical
terms, as well as in their visual aesthetics.[33] Confusion regarding
the boundaries of those two youth cultures has heightened because of the
late-1990s "multi-subcultural" cross-hybridization, which led people to
incorrectly believe that rivetheads are an offshoot of the goth
subculture. Canadian novelist and author [Nancy
Kilpatrick](Nancy_Kilpatrick "wikilink") labelled this youth-cultural
overlap "industrial goth",[34] as does Julia Borden.[35] ( − *Note*: In
the heyday of the rivethead culture, the term "industrial goth" as a
description of a youth culture did not exist).[36][37][38]

Goths are a [dark romantic](Dark_romanticism "wikilink") outgrowth of
the [punk](Punk_subculture "wikilink") and
[post-punk](post-punk "wikilink") movements that emerged in the early
1980s[39][40][41] while rivetheads developed from the [industrial dance
music](industrial_dance_music "wikilink") scene that came to be in the
second half of the 1980s, hand in hand with the media success of
post-industrial artists such as [Skinny Puppy](Skinny_Puppy "wikilink"),
[Front 242](Front_242 "wikilink"), [Front Line
Assembly](Front_Line_Assembly "wikilink"),
[Ministry](Ministry_(band) "wikilink"), [KMFDM](KMFDM "wikilink"),[42]
and [Numb](Numb_(band) "wikilink"). The rivethead scene shows a
provocative, insurgent as well as socio-critical approach. The Goth
subculture is frequently devoid of any interest in ethical activism or
political involvements.[43]
