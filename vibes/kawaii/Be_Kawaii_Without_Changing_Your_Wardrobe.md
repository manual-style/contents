Being kawaii can be tons of fun, and you don't have to change you
wardrobe or buy all new makeup. By changing your approach to people and
modifying the existing wardrobe you have (without buying new clothes),
you can be kawaii.

## Steps

1.  Act correctly. Always be positive, and be happy and welcoming.
    Welcome new people with a smile, and sometimes a sweet giggle can be
    necessary, too. Just remember, it's okay to be sad sometimes!
    -   If someone is being annoying, stare at them curiously or with no
        emotion, then look away, dropping the subject. Sometimes just
        your eyes can tell someone it's time to stop!
    -   If someone is being mean, then just smile, and wait until
        they're done. Make sure that you do not talk back! Dropping the
        subject is a way to make a mean person bored and not ruin your
        kawaii style.
2.  Update your outfit. To be kawaii, you don't have to change your
    entire wardrobe. Who says you don't look cute as a button in black
    or dark purple? Just mix and match to where you look kawaii in what
    you already own.
    -   Another part of wardrobe, is accessories. Accessories can be the
        final touch to your outfit that wraps it all up and makes it
        look kawaii. Sometimes it's even just a bracelet that completes
        your look and makes you look kawaii.
3.  Put on makeup. When trying to look kawaii, stop wearing certain
    kinds. Most kawaii people wear very little makeup. Lip gloss, and
    mascara are all that are truly needed. But you could probably also
    sneak some of your cheek/skin makeup on, too! Draw more attention to
    your eyes, than to your lips. Of course, though, if you think you
    still look kawaii in your everyday makeup, then go ahead and wear it
    proud!
4.  Do your hair. Try keeping your hairstyle normal, and spruce up your
    hair with a nice bow or headband. There's nothing else to it,
    really.
