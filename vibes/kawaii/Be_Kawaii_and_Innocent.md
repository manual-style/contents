2.  Wear cute clothes and fun bright colors or even go for pastels.
    Things like bunny sweaters, bloomers, kawaii sneakers, and anything
    along those lines works. Find a street fashion that appeals to
    you\~![](Be_Kawaii_and_Innocent_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Kawaii_and_Innocent_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Don't wear too much dark makeup, use softer colors and pastels
    instead. For hair, try a pony if you hair is short. If it is longer,
    just let it flow free!

4.  Don't swear or use foul words and don't hurt others. Kawaii girls
    don't swear like sailors and they don't hurt others on purpose. Be
    polite and say things like "Please" and "Thank
    You"![](Be_Kawaii_and_Innocent_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Kawaii_and_Innocent_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Wash up and stay clean. Good hygiene is very important. Smelling
    like a junk yard(and looking like one too) Isn't kawaii in any way,
    shape, or form. Shower every night with soap, brush your teeth, comb
    your hair, and eat the right
    foods.![](Be_Kawaii_and_Innocent_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_Kawaii_and_Innocent_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Carry around a stuffed animal and a purse or small book bag. This
    adds a cute touch to a person and make you appear innocent and
    almost child
    like.![](Be_Kawaii_and_Innocent_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_Kawaii_and_Innocent_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Find other interests. Join clubs or other activities. Just because
    your kawaii doesn't mean you have to be socially outcast. Join your
    schools anime club, or make one! Be a leader in certain situations
    and show that even though you are kawaii, people and just walk all
    over you. Some club ideas: Math, Reading, Art, Theatre,
    Anti-Bullying.

8.  Be loving and caring. Being rude and just plain mean isn't kawaii.
    Make good for your friends and show respect to everyone, even those
    who are mean to
    you.![](Be_Kawaii_and_Innocent_Step_8.jpg "fig:Be_Kawaii_and_Innocent_Step_8.jpg")
9.  And above all have fun. If your up tight all the time and you don't
    relax, people won't want to be around you. Don't take everything too
    serious, laugh and joke a little, but know when its time to get
    serious.
