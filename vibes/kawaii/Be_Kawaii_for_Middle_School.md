We all want to be kawaii, and middle school may be the perfect time for
you to start being kawaii! Weather you're going from goth to kawaii, or
you just want to be kawaii, you can learn how easily.

## Steps

### Goth to kawaii

1.  If you want to go from goth to kawaii, its a harder process, but
    easy to do still.  Start off slow, and in the end, you'll be the
    most kawaii girl there.
2.  Start with the hair.  The best way to go from goth to kawaii is to
    start with your hair.  If you dyed your hair, wait untill the dye
    fades out, or dye your hair your natural color until your hair
    grows.  The style of hair can stay the same, because some gothic
    hair styles are seen as kawaii.  Examples are:
    -   Long hair with bangs
    -   Medium lenght with bangs
    -   short with bangs
    -   bangs
    -   pixie
    -   bob
    -   short in frount long in back
    -   long in frount short in back
    -   fringe bangs
    -   layers
3.  Make-up.  So, to go to goth to kawaii make-up should start slowly,
    so nobody can say you changed overnight, that'd be pretty
    embarassing.  Start with the lips.  Insted of using a darker color,
    use clear or pale pink.  Dont do much eye make-up, it'll stand out
    to much.  Another thing is to wash your face often, and wear as
    little make-up as possible.  The make-up recomended for being kawaii
    is:
    -   clear mascara
    -   pale pink or clear lip gloss
    -   pale pink blush
    -   foundation (only if needed)
4.  The clothes.  Kawaii is all about the colors and patterns.  Being
    kawaii means to be cute, and that means do what ever you think is
    cute, but some of the most popular kawaii patterns and styles are:
    -   Anime schoolgirl
    -   pink
    -   floral
    -   polka dots
    -   glitter

### Acting Kawaii

1.  Acting kawaii is the biggest part of being kawaii. The best ways to
    act kawaii are to:
    -   Smile (it draws people to you)
    -   talk slower (it means your collecting your thoughts, and
        thinking more, and it makes you seem like you care, which is
        really cute)
    -   show your true emotions (JUstbecause your kawaii doesn't mean
        you can't yell when you get mad)
    -   get cute handwriting (Dot i with a heart, make it either bigger
        or smaller depending on the size it is now, and only do this is
        you know soebody will be reading it)
    -   skip (skipping can make you seem alot happier, and generally
        happier people are cuter, but dont do it all the time, or it can
        be called creepy.)
    -   Don't curse (if you stub your toe, dont yell the f-bomb, insted
        say something like, crap, omg, owwwww, sheet, fork, frick, or
        BEEEEEEEP! any of these can make you seem innocent, which is
        adorable.)

## Tips

-   Be yourself!
-   Only do this is you feel like it
-   don't do this overnight

## Warnings

-   If you're doing this to impress someone, stop and think, this isn't
    the real you, and if they like this you, then they were never worth
    the attention, because they made you change who you are
