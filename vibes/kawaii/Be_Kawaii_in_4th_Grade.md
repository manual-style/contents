It's a child's dream to be Kawaii, and sometimes, you can't find the
right clothes for it. With the right accessories and hair styles, you
will turn heads in school because you are so adorable.

## Steps

1.  Choose the right clothing. Wear a graphic tee with Japanese or
    English words on it, but avoid wearing anything with black or dark
    brown on it. If you can't find a T-shirt with Japanese phrases on
    it, try finding a shirt with Hello Kitty, Doraemon, cute emoticons,
    anime or manga pictures on it. Throw on a rainbow or a light blue
    vest, a pastel or pink coloured sweater, a white cardigan with the
    sleeves rolled up, or just a plain button-up sweater. Make sure to
    stick to innocent colours like pastels, whites, and lights.
2.  Wear the right pants. If you're a girl, put on a cute pink or white
    skirt with ruffles on the sides. Wear knee-high socks or striped
    socks. You can also wear white leggings and shorts with
    ombre-coloured patterns. You can toss on a pair of light coloured
    overalls. For a girly touch, tie cute bowties on each strap with red
    or pink ribbon.
3.  Try the best accessories. This is one of the most vital and
    important steps. Take this opportunity to express your interests and
    personality. A must-have for a girl is a cute headband, preferably
    one with a bow on it. Wear some cute bowtie, diamond, heart or star
    earrings, or you can wear clip-ons. Wear an elegant yet childish
    necklace, like one with a cherry on it or one half of a 'best
    friends' necklace. If it's cold out, wear fingerless gloves or a
    rainbow armband. Toss on a pretty pink watch and a beaded bracelet
    to bring out your personality. Wear silly bands for a childish feel.
    Another way you can achieve this cute look is to tie a bow behind
    your neck with a loose scarf, preferably one with birds or paw
    prints on it. Apply some cute unicorn, rainbow, or butterfly tattoos
    on a part of your body you know will be visible. You should try to
    avoid silver and gold rings, but feel free to wear one with an emoji
    or an emoticon on it.
4.  Style your hair. Hair is a big statement on your body. The hair can
    determine whether you're neat, cute, serious, angry, or tired! Put
    your hair in pigtails, a braided ponytail, bun ponytails, or a sock
    bun. Ultimately, you can dye your hair temporarily with kool-aid,
    and try a pink or a red. Put on some cute kawaii clips and hair
    ties. Find a hairband with a cupcake on it or a penguin on it. Spray
    your hair with hair spray to let your amazing style last.
5.  Shoes are a must! Find some cute flats that areÂ pink, red, purple,
    white, or ultimately, light brown. If you are wearing running shoes,
    wear velcro shoes for a kiddish feel. If you don't want to wear
    velcro shoes, Switch out the laces of your lace shoes with pink or
    ones with patterns on them. Try to find a pair of shoes that lights
    up when it feels pressure. Get ready for a little bit of DIY! Ask an
    adult to hot glue some glue onto the area of your shoe that needs
    some glam. Quickly, sprinkle some colourful glitter onto the glue
    while it is hot. Some stores sell shoes with glitter already on
    them.
6.  Make up and cosmetics. Every girl wants to try some. You don't
    necessarily need this step, but if you want to powder your face,
    apply a very subtle pink blush onto the apples of your cheeks. Curl
    your lashes and coat them with a few coats of mascara. Don't apply
    any eyeshadow, because that look will be too harsh! Use pink lip
    gloss to make your lips shine. Bring the same lip gloss to school
    for touch-ups during the day. Optionally, you can cover up any red
    spots on your face with a concealer or a peach blush or eyeshadow.
    For nails(an unskippable step), apply a cupcake pink on all of your
    nails except your ring fingers. Paint those nails white. Optionally,
    coat cupcake sprinkle nail glitter onto your pink nails, but don't
    use shiny glitter or shiny polish. Feel free to apply nail tattoos
    or stickers and set everything with a clear, fast drying top coat.

## Tips

-   Replace all of your visible band-aids with cute, colourful ones.
-   Apply some roll-on perfume on your wrists and neck.
-   Comb your hair thoroughly before styling.
-   Apply a base coat before applying any nail polish for long-lasting
    nails.
-   Wear a pastel bandanna around your forehead, neck, or wrist.
-   If this is for Halloween or a play, wear a princess crown and hold
    onto a pink scepter with glitter inside it.
-   Avoid high-heels. They are dangerous.
-   Clip your nails for a childish look.

## Warnings

-   Make sure to let an adult use hot glue. It could burn you.
-   Don't wear clip-on earrings for an extended amount of time.
-   Do not tie anything around your neck too tightly.
-   Don't wear high heels. They can twist your ankle.
