Want to look and feel Kawaii even if you lack the confidence to be fully
kawaii or the effort to be a full blown kawaii girl? This article can
show you how to inject a good amount of Kawaii/Gyaru into your everyday
life without going 'all out'.

## Steps

### Feeling The Part

1.  In order to feel Kawaii, you have to have a few things. First, you
    need to be able to do what you want without fear of judgement from
    others; if what you wear makes you feel good, then it's far more
    important than a few people thinking you're weird. Being yourself is
    the most important part of this process.
2.  To truly achieve a carefree mindset such as this, it's important to
    surround yourself with people who don't judge others or people who
    have similar taste to yours. Subtle Kawaii may be for those who do
    not feel completely confident enough to go all out, or for those who
    just want to have a small dose of Kawaii in their everyday life.
3.  Feeling confident is a must. You cannot let other's judgement and
    the way they perceive you stop you from wearing, acting or feeling
    confident.Â If you feel confident in yourself, it will be harder for
    others to bring you down.

### Dressing/Looking The Part

1.  Dressing the part is rather important, as being subtle kawaii means
    you have to add at least a few kawaii accessories to your wardrobe
    or even a few pretty uniforms. Stuff like phone charms, fake/painted
    nails, and having bows or ribbons in your hair styles can achieve
    this sort of look.If you want to take it a step further, adding a
    few seifuku's (Japanese School Uniform) to your wardrobe can add a
    charming yet cute flair that perhaps nobody else at your school
    would have.Seifuku's can easily be found on both Ebay and Amazon,
    and also adding a sweater to a seifuku leads to a kawaii overload.
    For false nails, it can be as easy as just getting some press on's
    from a store or you could get them done at a salon if you want them
    to last longer.
2.  Having a kawaii hairstyle is very easy and also the most easy to get
    away with in a strict school or without looking too odd or out of
    place.Kawaii hairstyles can be pigtails, buns, ponytails and many
    more. Almost all hairstyles can be considered some form of
    kawaii/gyaru/visual kei depending on your cut, bangs, and color.If
    you want to take it a step further and also add a bit more of an
    innocent look, adding hair accessories can be a huge help.Stuff like
    ribbons, scrunchies, and patterned hair clips can add a 'moe' image
    to your look.
3.  In many japanese fashion subcultures such as Ganguro, Gyaru, Kogal's
    and Decora can be seen with extravagant false nails. Of course, with
    subtle kawaii, even just plain pastel purple nails can be seen as
    subtle kawaii.Fake nails are fairly easy to come by in many forms,
    such as the kind you can get at nail salons or even simple press-ons
    you can buy at regular stores like walmart.Depending on your look,
    (Visual kei, decora, etc.) the color of the nails will not matter
    much.It is a good idea to get a color that can go along with many
    outfits, kawaii or not or even just plain french tip nails that go
    with virtually any clothing.
4.  If you want to have more subtle kawaii clothing, simple combos like
    a comfy sweater and a skirt with some knee high socks can be
    amazingly kawaii but subtle enough to be fit for school.If pastels
    are your thing, such styles like fairy kei and hime-gyaru can be a
    good way to express that interest. They can be subtle kawaii as
    well. Finding hime-gyaru and fairy kei items is surprisingly easy,
    as Etsy and Ebay have a lot of used or new items from both of these
    fashion subcultures.Amazon mainly has more pastel goth items than
    they do fairy kei or hime-gyaru, but a few select pieces from the
    site could be suitable for both fashions.Ebay has a LOT of used
    hime-gyaru clothing from lots of different japanese brands, and
    quite a few fairy kei pieces as well. However, if you're looking for
    custom or one of a kind pieces, Etsy would be the place to go.Ebay
    also has a lot of uniform type outfits that come with a shirt,
    ribbon/tie, sweater and skirt which are great for subtle kawaii as
    they look like normal uniforms or regular outfits.

### Smelling The Part

1.  Kawaii girls in general shouldn't smell bad, and having certain
    scents can boost your kawaii factor.Some scents could go better with
    certain fashions, like maybe a forest-y perfume scent for Visual Kei
    and a floral/spring scent for Hime-Gyaru. Of course, this is all up
    to personal preference.
2.  It's recommended that you keep your hair nice and clean at all
    times, as kawaii girls tend to style their hair often and it would
    be unjust to have it dirty.
3.  Makeup is present in almost all Japanese fashion subcultures,
    however, this does not mean that you HAVE to wear it unless you're a
    Ganguro girl. It's important to keep your skin nice and clear, too!
    Washing your face everyday and using face masks is a part of having
    a subtle kawaii-ness.

## Tips

-   Having glasses or short hair doesn't mean you can't have subtle
    kawaii-ness!
-   You can be kawaii no matter your race, gender, or sexuality! Kawaii
    is a fashion that is for everyone.
