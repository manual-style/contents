## Steps

1.  Wear Kawaii clothes. Kawaii God always wears pastel/white clothing,
    so wear pastel colors such as mint, lavender, and pale blue, as well
    as white. Have a cute accessory like a teddy bear or something else
    that looks "childish." Kawaii God wears platform Converse, so get a
    pair of those.
2.  Wear Kawaii makeup. Kawaii Boy wears a soft pink color on his lips
    and cheeks. This is because it makes him look healthier and cuter.
    He wears contact lenses in brown, so buy contact lenses that are in
    the same size as your eye. Contact lenses can irritate your eye, so
    steer clear of cheap ones.
3.  Wear Kawaii hair. Kawaii Boy's natural hair is brown. Brighter hair
    like light brown, blond, or black is cute too but he prefers light
    brown. Cut your hair into a ponytail! Kawaii Boy always has one
    because it looks more childlike.
4.  Be kindhearted. He has a big heart for everyone so be open and be
    nice to everyone you meet or see!. Sadly, Kawaii Boy has a lot of
    "haters." Apparently, these are mostly boys who call him "gay" but
    it doesn't bother him and he keeps on living his life, you should do
    that too! Ignore everything negative like he does. Don't say bad
    words because, as he said, "it's not Kawaii."
5.  Be yourself . Kawaii Boy is himself. He doesn't pretend to be
    another person. He's just like that so don't pretend to be exactly
    like him. Be yourself but you can look like a kawaii boy like him.
