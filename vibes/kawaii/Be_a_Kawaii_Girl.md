Have you ever desired to be just like girls that look like the most
innocent, adorable people on the planet? Read this article to learn how
to be kawaii yourself!

## Steps

### Having Kawaii Attitude

1.  Don't worry about race and ethnicity––these don't matter. Even if
    you are not Asian, you can still be Kawaii. Being Kawaii is more
    than just about race or ethnicity. Your body shape doesn't matter
    either, Kawaii girls can be short, tall, flat, curvy, or skinny!

2.  Get the attitude. Kawaii girls have sweet, nice attitudes that
    everyone loves! They giggle a lot, are super kind to everyone around
    them, never pick fights, and are just pleasant to be around! Kawaii
    is all about being adorable, so find things that you like. Hello
    Kitty is super adorable and loved by many so that's a good place to
    start. Don't just get something because it is Kawaii, get it because
    you like
    it.![](Be-a-Conservative-Girl-Step-9-Version-2.jpg "fig:Be-a-Conservative-Girl-Step-9-Version-2.jpg")

### Looking Kawaii

1.  Get the look. Here's where the innocent, lovable image comes in.
    Kawaii girls dress in bright, frilly clothes that just scream
    "cute!". Think outfits like floral, childish/elegant, scalloped
    designs, patterned overalls, balloon shorts with bows,
    etc.![](Wear-Ankle-Boots-Step-15.jpg "fig:Wear-Ankle-Boots-Step-15.jpg")
    -   Go out shopping find the most adorable clothing you can find.
        Look for colour and cuteness, but, if you don't love and don't
        think it would look good on you, put it back. Don't buy
        something you don't like just because it is Kawaii.
2.  Dress brightly and colorfully. Put lots of key chains and things
    like that on your backpack or purse. Kid Robot has some Kawaii
    stuffed animals. Accessorize well and make sure your outfits look
    good
    together.![](Be-a-Sweet-Lolita-Step-6.jpg "fig:Be-a-Sweet-Lolita-Step-6.jpg")
    -   Try finding old or used clothes and add lace, bows or other cute
        attributes.
    -   Many things that don't seem kawaii can look great with some
        changes. For example, you could add cute animal stickers to
        white sneakers. Try adding lace to a normal skirt.
3.  Do Kawaii makeup. Use black gel and/or liquid eyeliner, pink cream
    blush, sparkly pink lip gloss, and light concealer/foundation. You
    want a clean but innocent makeup look. For a good Kawaii makeup
    tutorial, watch Jemma Kuma's video on Kawaii makeup on
    YouTube.![](Make-Your-Face-Like-Korean-Girls-Step-7-Version-2.jpg "fig:Make-Your-Face-Like-Korean-Girls-Step-7-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Don't do anything sexy if you want to fully follow the kawaii
        style. Don't do smoky eye, for example.
4.  Get your nails done. Look videos up on Youtube if you want a good
    idea for DIY ideas. Often Kawaii girls wear fake, long and
    accessorized nails. This might be too much for you, so you got to
    find out what suits you. Neatly manicured nails are also good and
    can work in lots of
    looks.![](Improve-Your-Appearance-Step-7-Version-2.jpg "fig:Improve-Your-Appearance-Step-7-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Try adding stickers to your nails. Just be careful not to paint
        over them. If would be best to add them after your nails are
        dry.
5.  Keep your eyes as large as possible. In pictures, Kawaii girls
    always have eyes wide open. You can lay an ice-cold washcloth on
    your eyes for about five minutes, then apply some pearly eyeshadow
    to under your eyes, on your crease. Big eyes are cute, but don't
    worry if your eyes aren't
    big.![](Make-Eyes-Look-Bigger-Step-10-Version-2.jpg "fig:Make-Eyes-Look-Bigger-Step-10-Version-2.jpg")
6.  Do Kawaii hair. For hair, think "young child." Pigtails, side
    ponytails, braids, anything you'd see on a student in elementary
    school. Don't forget to add
    bows!![](Have-Wavy-Hair-Without-Using-Hair-Products-Step-3-Version-2.jpg "fig:Have-Wavy-Hair-Without-Using-Hair-Products-Step-3-Version-2.jpg")

### Being Kawaii

1.  Be yourself. Add your own flair to the Kawaii style using whatever
    you like, and make the style your
    own.![](Be-Charming-Step-7.jpg "fig:Be-Charming-Step-7.jpg")
2.  Try watching anime. It is super fun and interesting and there is
    something for everyone. It's not all fighting and things like that!
    For example, try watching Peach Girl. It's
    great!![](Draw-an-Anime-Girl's-Face-Step-8.jpg "fig:Draw-an-Anime-Girl's-Face-Step-8.jpg")
3.  Surround yourself with friends, Kawaii or not. Really, labels don't
    matter at all. All that really matters is how much love and support
    you surround yourself
    with.![](Be-Charming-Step-4.jpg "fig:Be-Charming-Step-4.jpg")
4.  Have Kawaii role models. Look around online for great Kawaii women
    you can look up to. Make sure they make good decisions, are super
    nice and sweet, and use good language, because Kawaii girls never
    curse.![](Be-Charming-Step-11-Version-2.jpg "fig:Be-Charming-Step-11-Version-2.jpg")
    -   Many K-pop and J-pop idols are kawaii or have clothes that could
        be kawaii. Some look cuter than others. You can copy their
        outfit styles, which will make you look more kawaii. Go check
        them out!

## Tips

-   Use cute little smiley faces! Like this for example: {◕ ◡ ◕}. You
    can find lots and lots online!
-   If you just want to follow around people or be "cool" than don\`t
    bother and just find your own style. If you do not enjoy these
    things then please don\`t do this to yourself! If you just love the
    look, you can only follow that if you\`d like.
-   Always have a positive attitude and smile more often.
-   If you want a couple of good role models from anime you could try
    Wendy Marvell or Levi McGarden from the show Fairy Tail.
-   A lot of animes have kawaii characters you could try watching the
    animes they are in such as: K-on, Lucky star, Kaichou wa maid-sama
    and Boku wa tomodachi ga sukunai.
-   Even if you have never watched Clannad, search Nagisa Furukawa. She
    is the absolute definition of kawaii. Never swears, always smiles,
    and is always trying her best to help others be happy. She has a
    sensitive and innocent personality, someone you should definitely
    shoot for if you want to be kawaii.
-   If you don’t have a lot of money to spend on kawaii accessories, try
    making your own cute jewelry out of polymer clay.
-   Try to act as innocent as possible.
-   Have a little bounce in your step when you walk or jump/skip.

## Warnings

-   Even though you're Kawaii, do know that some people are still gonna
    hate, sadly. This isn't a fix for bad social situations. Just rock
    your style and ignore the people drinking Haterade!
-   Don't change your voice just to sound cute. This can come across as
    very unnatural and fake, Kawaii is about being your adorable self!
-   Don't use "desu" after every sentence unless you want to be labeled
    as a poser.
