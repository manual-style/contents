Do you want to be evil? But as kawaii as a button?

## Steps

1.  Whatever you do, do it to the kawaii-est you can! Don't walk with a
    slump after a bad day of school. Walk upright and straight, with a
    pout.![](Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Mix and match. Choose one color, then buy clothes only of that color
    and black. This may be hard, but once you get all of them, it'll be
    so easy to
    dress.![](Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Hair is everything. Try dying your hair black and straightening it.
    It is very dark but cute if you wear a giant pink bow with a skull
    on
    it.![](Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Have a secret talent. If you suddenly show that talent to your
    school or something, that can be very very kawaii, trust
    me.![](Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Make a dark kawaii list. For example these are kawaii: buttons,
    bows, ribbons, over knee socks, dolly shoes, lipstick. When you get
    them in black or wear them with black, you'll look very
    Kawaii.![](Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Do not paste on your make-up and look orange. A little cover-up with
    swirls around your eyes and pink and black checkered lipstick is
    cute and
    Dark.![](Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_6.jpg")
7.  BE kawaii. Sing along (if you suck at singing, hum) to cute songs
    and smile when you are with your friends. When you are at school and
    someone annoys you just stare at them with no emotion and drop it,
    as simple as
    that.![](Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Have a theme. Be very themed no matter
    what.![](Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Tsundere is very cute. Look it up and learn to talk like Rie, the
    queen of
    tsunderes.![](Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Dark_Kawaii_Step_9.jpg")

## Tips

-   This is a 24/7 thing, let your guard down and you're a goner!
-   If being kawaii doesn't click with you, don't worry about it! You
    shouldn't have to work hard not to be yourself. Just being yourself
    will be better than practicing how to not be yourself. You'll be
    better off, believe me.
-   Act nice to animals, and you can be scared of them.
-   Acting evil doesn't mean being evil, watch horror movies or love
    Halloween, or have evil plans, just don't go too overboard.
-   Don't act so scary you scare away children.
-   Red is a good color to pick because it's very popular and cute.

## Warnings

-   If people know you're putting on a cute accent, drop it and practice
    some more.
-   Do *not* beat up people. It's just plain dangerous and almost
    illegal.
-   Yayoi Takatsuki from idolm@ster is not cute whatsoever. Do not try
    to copy her to be cute, she is Genki, not Kawaii, Iori Minase from
    idolm@ster is.
