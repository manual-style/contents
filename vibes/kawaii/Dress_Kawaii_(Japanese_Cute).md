Kawaii is a Japanese word that means cute, and it has its own associated
style. Kawaii people are adorable and fun, and loved by all! Read on to
learn how to be kawaii!

## Steps

1.  Consider your style. This is about being mega cute, colorful but
    sweet and not too noisy. Draw manga and anime, perhaps by [watching
    some YouTube videos](Search_YouTube "wikilink") about it. Discuss
    Japanese culture and clothing with your friends to shape your own
    views. [Play Dance Dance](Play_Dance_Dance_Revolution "wikilink")
    and maybe some calligraphy, and write messages with love, peace
    symbols in Japanese to friends. There are many ways to form your
    style.![](Dress_Kawaii_(Japanese_Cute)_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Kawaii_(Japanese_Cute)_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Consider your clothing. Try to dress colourfully, see cute anime
    pictures, they'll get you in the mood. For anime style, you can wear
    pretty pastels, frills, ruffles and collars can complete a simple
    kawaii look ... casual but cute! As for a fancier lolita-type style,
    try out Japanese pastel skirts that can be found online. Frilly
    collared shirts in colors like pastel pink, white, lavender and
    light blue can set off an adorable lolita outfit. Try out some
    oriental clothing in alternative clothing stores, and don't be
    afraid to try something bold. Shirts with cute graphics and frills
    paired with a pastel tutu and some mary-janes is very cutesy and
    suit this look perfectly. If you don't want to spend too much money,
    you can always try investing in things like socks, tights, headbands
    or even wigs if you are into that.

3.  Change your hair. A lot of times, kawaii-style hair is in cute
    pigtails and braids, so try those out. Try and work your hair into a
    manga or anime inspired hairdo. While bangs are not necessary, they
    set off the look really well and add a lot to the cuteness effect.
    Then a sparkly headband or some glittery clips from a clothing store
    will do. You can also buy pastel lolita wigs from online stores to
    be truly kawaii. Most kawaii girls use wigs because kawaii people
    change their hair color often, and too much hair dye can damage your
    hair. If you don't want to buy a wig and still want to spice up your
    normal hair, a pastel pink or violet purple streak is adorable and
    will fit nicely with the theme. Another hair-dye option is ombre
    which can even be done temporarily with
    Kool-Aid.![](Dress_Kawaii_(Japanese_Cute)_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Kawaii_(Japanese_Cute)_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")

## Tips

-   Don't just dress kawaii, live it. If you don't feel comfortable in
    it, don't.
-   Be yourself too, never become some other character, be you, that's
    the most important tip; if you are not yourself, people will call
    you poser.
-   Cut fringe/bangs. If you don't want to cut your hair, you can buy
    fake fringes/bangs. Fringes make you look innocent, adorable and
    kawaii.

## Warnings

-   People may call you a poser, a player, or some kind of imitation.
    Shrug it off and smile.
-   If you go overboard, be prepared to become accustomed to stares and
    comments. Only be over-the-top if you're sure you can handle it!
