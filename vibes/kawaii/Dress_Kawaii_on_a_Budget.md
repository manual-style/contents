Here is a little tutorial on how to dress kawaii without spending too
much money! Some steps might require some purchases. Should work for
both genders.

## Steps

### What do you already have?

1.  Look through your closet to see if you already have kawaii clothing!
    I suggest looking for things with pastel colours, cute designs, or
    cute patterns.
2.  Now, look through your accessories. Do you have one of those
    rhinestone headbands laying around? You haven't been wearing that!
    Look for flower crowns, cute headbands, pink bows, cute/animal
    earrings and bracelets.

### To the stores!

1.  Go to thrift stores or Goodwill! They have lots of used stuff that
    might be kawaii, and it's really cheap and inexpensive!

### Let's get crafty! (Last part!)

1.  Go on YouTube and look up kawaii clothing DIYs! You can get fabric
    from craft shops for REALLY cheap, as well with thread. I bet you
    could rent a sewing machine- or maybe do it yourself!
2.  Look up kawaii makeup tutorials! Lots of kawaii fashion models use
    eye enlarging makeup to make their eyes look big and kawaii, simply
    using things that you could buy at a local store!

## Warnings

-   If you're also trying to act kawaii, be simple with it. If you go
    too far, you'll annoy people.
