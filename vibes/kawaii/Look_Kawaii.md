fashion is all about finding what makes you feel happy! To look kawaii,
there are a few basic guidelines to follow when you're thinking about
picking outfits, adding accessories, and styling your makeup and hair.

## Steps

### Dressing in Kawaii Style

1.  Wear t-shirts with bold prints and pastel colors. Dressing kawaii is
    a personal process, but you want to make sure you have at least one
    statement piece in every outfit that you create. Find your personal
    balance between comfort and
    fashion.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Graphic t-shirts and sweatshirts make great statement pieces
        that are comfortable. These can range from anime-inspired
        t-shirts with characters printed on them to sweatshirts with
        animal themes. For example, you might want an entire sweatshirt
        made into the face of a panda bear.[1]
    -   Pick pastels. Kawaii style often offsets bold designs with soft
        colors. Try creating an outfit base with creams, ballet pink,
        lavender, light green, and baby blue.
    -   Update classic styles with cute prints. For example, take a
        plain pair of cream Converse shoes and decorate them with
        repeating cute objects like cats or ice cream cones. If you make
        your own clothing adjustments, you’ll have one-of-a-kind pieces.
    -   Add frills. The sweet baby doll look is an important part of
        kawaii styling. Try wearing blouses, dresses, and socks with
        lots of ruffles or pleats.
2.  Follow kawaii blogs, and create a style board. Like any style,
    kawaii changes all the time. Unless you live in Japan, you're not
    going to see a lot of kawaii around you on the streets, so looking
    online can help you update your kawaii
    wardrobe.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For example, current trends in kawaii include pleated,
        school-girl style skirts and chunky sweater layers in the
        classic kawaii pastel tones, like pink, purple, yellow, and
        blue![2]
    -   Search words like “kawaii” and “Japanese fashion” on Tumblr to
        see pages of current images from the kawaii style. Follow blogs
        that strike your eye, and use these as inspiration for creating
        new outfits with clothes you already have.
    -   Make a kawaii mood board online. Use sites like Pinterest or
        Polyvore to keep track of trends you like and to save your own
        ideal outfit combinations.
3.  Choose clothing that doesn't reveal too much. Kawaii clothing fits
    well but still leaves something to the imagination. It retains a
    kind of playful innocence. Kawaii is all about
    balance.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For example, if you want to wear a short skirt, try pairing it
        with thigh-high socks, a long sleeve top, and chunky platform
        shoes.
4.  Layer well. Layering is a key part of kawaii fashion, no matter what
    specific style within kawaii you want to
    achieve.[3]![](Look_Kawaii_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Mix and match sweet patterns with bright colors.
    -   Wear bright leggings or tights underneath ruffled skirts or
        dresses.
    -   Pair a white long sleeve top with a colorful sleeveless dress.
5.  Add kawaii accessories. Cute, fuzzy accessories are a staple of
    kawaii. You can try to let your accessories match your outfit, with
    either the colors being the same or having a matching print. Also
    popular are brightly colored accessories and accessories adorned
    with 'chibi,’ meaning small, adorable depictions of manga or anime
    characters, often with larger-than-life
    heads.[4]![](Look_Kawaii_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Keep a cute Tamagotchi or stuffed animal with you all the time.
        Small Tamagotchi toys can be attached to key chains or
        necklaces, and stuffed animals can peep out of bags. Some
        stuffed animals even have Velcro pads on the end of long limbs,
        enabling them to hang around your shoulder.
6.  Always carry a bag. This is a practical way to carry your stuff, and
    it’s another way to show off your unique
    style.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Use a messenger bag. You can get a plain one and decorate it
        with kawaii pins and patches, or try painting it with fabric
        paints. Messenger bags give you plenty of room to carry around
        your laptop, a notebook, or games.
    -   Find a unique cross-body bag. Many purses exist to fit your
        personal kawaii style. For example, you can find ones with large
        bows, bags made to look like animals, purses shaped like clouds,
        and purses with lots of frills.
    -   Try looking on auction sites like eBay or crafter sites like
        Etsy to find interesting, affordable bags that others won’t
        have.
7.  Curate your possessions. Having cute everyday things that match your
    style is a large part of kawaii
    fashion.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For example, if you're using a plain blue binder and yellow
        pencils at school, this doesn’t fit your aesthetic.
    -   Invest in some cute stationery, bento boxes, and bags. You can
        always order online if things like this aren’t available where
        you live.
    -   If you can’t buy them yourself, ask for kawaii gifts for your
        birthday and major holidays.

### Creating Kawaii Make Up and Hair

1.  Wear base makeup sparingly. Use a light-coverage foundation that
    looks natural.[5] Avoid foundations that look thick or caked. Keep
    blush to a
    minimum.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Focus on the eyes. In kawaii style, you want your eyes to look round
    and wide.[6] Use plenty of black mascara on both your top and bottom
    lashes.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you use eyeliner, use a black liquid liner close to your lash
        line. Don’t bring it out into a cat eye.
    -   Use colorful eyeshadow. Keep your eyeshadows colorful and light.
        Try a light pink, green, or blue. Avoid a smoky eye look, as
        this is more of a sexy style than kawaii.
    -   Use a white or skin-toned pencil to line your waterline. This
        will make your eyes appear brighter and wider.[7]
3.  Wear nude lipsticks. In the kawaii style, lipstick should always be
    pink or coral, never dark. Apply lip gloss
    sparingly.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If your skin is darker, you may want a slightly darker pink tone
        or even purple.
4.  Keep your nails neat and painted. You’ll want to use a clear or soft
    pink polish to accentuate the innocence of your look. The kawaii
    style doesn’t use neon or dark
    colors.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
    -   You should keep your nails short and rounded.
5.  Add perfume. The perfume will add just hint of some extra to your
    stylized but still demur kawaii look. Go for a perfume that is mild
    and slightly sweet or
    floral.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Spritz the perfume on your wrists and neck sparingly.
6.  Try out fringe or bangs. The classic kawaii hairstyle is medium to
    long hair with thick, straight across
    bangs.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you’re uncertain about cutting your bangs, try using a faux
        fringe hair clip.
7.  Consider color. If you want to go all out with your kawaii look, you
    might dye your hair. Classic kawaii hair colors include light pink,
    lavender, or
    white-blonde.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_14_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_14_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Accessorize your hair. In kawaii style, hair accessories can help
    you to stand out even
    more.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_15_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_15_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Look for unique headbands or make some yourself. Think pom poms,
        hearts, stars, animal ears, and glitter.
    -   Try wearing huge bows.
    -   Style your hair into pigtails, and add in hair clips for more
        creativity.
9.  Smile and giggle frequently. This will accentuate the facial look
    you’ve created through your kawaii hair and make up. Nothing says
    kawaii like an adorable
    giggle.![](Look_Kawaii_Step_16_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Kawaii_Step_16_Version_2.jpg")
    -   You should come across like a child who is genuinely amused
        about something.

## Tips

    kawaii.

    extensions.
