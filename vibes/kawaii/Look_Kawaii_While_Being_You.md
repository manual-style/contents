Are you ready for a Kawaii look? Are you afraid that you won't be you
anymore? Ask yourself do I want to be Asian or me? Well, you can do
both! Just follow these steps.

## Steps

1.  Gather any styling tools you MIGHT need, but you don't have to
    unless you want to be a true cutie.
2.  Now makeup. Kawaii is being cute and childish. Kawaii is NOT smoky
    eye looks. That is more punk than Kawaii. Keep the eyeliner to a
    minimum (liquid is a better Kawaii look) and either wear bright
    (NEVER DARK) eyeshadow or none at all.
3.  Don't be afraid to stand out. Once you hit the road and go places
    with Kawaii looks people will make faces but don't get annoyed. They
    are just bullies that want you to be broken, or they wish they were
    you.
4.  Now clothes. You need light clothes NO BLACK OR GRAY! Black and gray
    is more punk (again) than Kawaii. If you want a total Kawaii look
    use a pink shirt and a yellow shirt. Kawaii also is layering so but
    pink leggings under the skirt and yellow undershirt. For shoes put
    some cute pumps on or wedges.
5.  Add some accessories to your hair, put your hair in pigtails or a
    braid then put some bobby pins and clips in your hair.
6.  After you're done, before you take off your look, take some
    pictures!

## Tips

-   Remember you want to keep your personality add some touches to
    anything.
-   Carry a cute teddy bear and put it in a handbag or purse or
    messenger bag.
-   If people want a picture, don't be shy EVER. Strike a pose!
-   Giggle and smile, but don't overdo it.

## Warnings

-   Bullies are out there, but don't stoop down to their level. Try
    shaking it off or saying, "I am rubber, you are glue, whatever you
    say bounces off of me and sticks to you."

## Things You'll Need

-   Accessories
-   Light clothes
-   Anything that YOU think YOU need or anything that completes your
    look
