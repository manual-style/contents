How to pick a cute outfit, do your makeup and hair, and make a good
first impression on your first day of school!

## Steps

1.  Choose a cute outfit. First you will need a cute pair of bottoms. If
    your school has a dress code, wear a pair of skinny jeans, because
    long shorts aren't very pretty, but you can wear them if you like
    them. If there isn't a dress code, wear a pair of denim short
    shorts. Then add a cute shirt. Some styles that are cute right now
    are floaty tank tops, fitted scoop neck tees, crop tops, and graphic
    tees. Then add a cute pair of shoes and some accessories. For
    example, a cute outfit for the first day would be dark skinny jeans,
    a floaty tank top with a little bit of lace detail, over a cami,
    some combat boots or strappy sandals, and a cute necklace and
    earrings. Another cute outfit would be a pair of white denim short
    shorts, a light blue fitted tee shirt, some silver necklaces,
    feather earrings, and strappy sandals. If you don't like either of
    those ideas, you can change them by switching the shoes or the
    bottoms, and adding one of your favorite things to wear, like a
    pretty
    bracelet.![](Be_Cute_and_Fashionable_on_the_First_Day_of_School_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_Cute_and_Fashionable_on_the_First_Day_of_School_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Put on makeup. Natural makeup always looks best, especially if you
    are 10-12 and have just started wearing makeup. To look natural,
    apply some light brown, gold, or pearly white eyeshadow to just your
    eyelid. It should look like a semicircle if done properly. Add some
    mascara, and a little bit of eyeliner if you want to. If you have
    very pale skin, brush on some bronzing powder, and if your skin is
    tanner, add some cream blush. Finish with a little bit of pink or
    clear
    lipgloss.![](Be_Cute_and_Fashionable_on_the_First_Day_of_School_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Cute_and_Fashionable_on_the_First_Day_of_School_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Fix your hair. If you have curly hair, clip the front parts back
    with a clip and let the rest fall over your shoulders. Add some
    mousse or gel to stop frizz, and spray on hairspray and shine spray,
    if you want it. If you have straight hair, you can curl it, which
    looks very pretty, or just leave it straight. Use a flatiron if it
    isn't perfect. then brush it, add some shine spray, and a little bit
    of anti frizz product if you have frizzy hair. Wavy hair is
    beautiful and should be left how it is, but if your hair is thick,
    use a flatiron and some relaxing
    product.![](Be_Cute_and_Fashionable_on_the_First_Day_of_School_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_Cute_and_Fashionable_on_the_First_Day_of_School_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Look and smell nice. The morning before school starts, take a shower
    with cool water (hot water can make your skin red), wash your body
    and face, shampoo and condition your hair with nice smelling shampoo
    and conditioner, and shave your legs and underarms if you are
    allowed to. After you eat breakfast, brush your teeth and floss, or
    chew some gum if you want. Put on deodorant and perfume if you have
    it, and then start getting ready. After your hair and makeup is
    done, get dressed, pack your bag, and go to
    school!![](Be_Cute_and_Fashionable_on_the_First_Day_of_School_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Cute_and_Fashionable_on_the_First_Day_of_School_Step_4.jpg")

## Tips

-   Don't put in too much hair product or your hair will get crunchy and
    start to dry out.
-   If you want to paint your nails, pick a color that matches your
    outfit for your fingernails, and choose your favorite color for your
    toenails
-   Smile!
-   When choosing an outfit, shop at places like Forever 21, Wet Seal,
    Abercrombie Kids, Aeropostale, Hollister, Juicy Couture, Nordstrom,
    Macys, and Marshalls. Those stores are in right now.

## Warnings

-   Avoid shopping at Justice, Gap, or Old Navy. Those stores are mainly
    for elementary schools, and don't fit the style of middle school and
    especially high school.

    beauty, not make you look like a clown.
