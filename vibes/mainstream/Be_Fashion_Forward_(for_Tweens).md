follow these instructions and you'll be sure to feel stylish and proud
in no time!

## Steps

### Wearing the Right Clothes

1.  Get rid of the old clothes you don't need. If you feel like you need
    a change, then it may be because your old clothes are boring. Do a
    closet inventory and get rid of everything you don't like or that
    doesn't fit. This will not only get you more space for new clothes,
    but it will also help you find good clothes that you may have
    forgotten about. Just remember to not get rid of any clothes you
    like because they are "not cool". Your style is your
    choice!![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Go to the mall. Go shopping with your mother or with your good
    friends. Make sure that whoever you're shopping with won't judge
    your style and make you pick what they want; you're trying to be
    original, remember? If you can't find anyone to go with, see if you
    can online shop or go alone. Real life shopping is better, though,
    because you can feel and see the clothing, while you can't do that
    online.![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Pick the right stores. Picking stores that are "cool" won't do you
    any good unless you really like the store. Go to stores that grab
    your attention with clothes that *you* think are cool. Some nice
    stores are: Abercrombie and Fitch, Delia's, Target, Kohl's, H & M,
    and Forever
    21.![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Look for deals. Once you're in a store, look around for deals. It's
    okay to get something a little more expensive, but if it's your own
    money you're using, then you should go for deals and cheaper
    prices.![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Find clothes you like. Don't choose your clothes based on what other
    people think is "fashionable". Choose what you like because you like
    it, not because someone else
    does.![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Be inspired. You can find inspiration from other people, characters,
    places, other time periods, and more. Remember that you're creating
    your own style, so don't ever overdo
    it!![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Choose a variety of clothes. Remember to choose a variety of
    clothes, not just one certain style or type. Choose different
    skirts, dresses, pants, shirts, leggings, coats, and more. Even if
    you're a tomboy, at least trying on a dress or skirt isn't the end
    of the world! You never know—you may like
    it!![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_7.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Try it on. Try on your clothes and show your shopping buddy. A good
    shopping buddy is always honest, and will be sure to tell you if you
    don't look good in something! If something doesn't fit, try it in a
    different size. Never get something you don't completely and totally
    like, or otherwise you won't wear
    it!![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_8.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Wear different types of clothes. Don't keep "sets" of clothes and
    only wear those as outfits. That won't be original at all! Mix
    things up a bit and don't be afraid to take a fashion risk! Try a
    skirt with super skinny jeans, or use your scarf as a
    belt!![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_9.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_9.jpg")
10. Wear your clothes with pride. If someone says your style rocks, look
    them in the eye and say "Thank you!" If someone says they hate your
    outfit, look them in the eye and say 'If i wanted your opinion, I
    would have asked for it," and walk away. *Never* be afraid to be
    you!![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_10.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_10.jpg")

### Wearing Accessories

1.  Wear nice accessories. Try things like belts, scarves, hats, etc.
    You can go shopping at stores that sell clothes or stores just for
    accessories like
    Claire's.![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_11.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_11.jpg")
2.  Do it yourself. Go online and look up some cute DIY accessories such
    as earrings, bracelets, etc. If you know how to knit or sew, use it
    to your benefit and make yourself a scarf or hat! Use your talents
    to your best
    ability.![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_12.jpg")
3.  Wear unique jewellery. If you like jewellery, then you can wear
    earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and more! They don't need to be pure
    24 carat gold; costume jewelry works just as well. If you don't like
    jewellery, then don't wear it! Style can shine without any jewels at
    all!![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_13.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_13.jpg")

### Wearing Makeup

1.  Decide whether or not you want to wear makeup. This is a choice
    between you and your parents. Ask them if it's okay, and if so, do
    it on the weekends if you like. If your school is okay with makeup,
    then wear it if you want! Never overdo it, makeup doesn't make
    beauty. It just lets it shine
    brighter!![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_14.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_14.jpg")
2.  Wear subtle mascara if you want to. Just a little mascara, light
    colored eye shadow, and blush and lipgloss can go a long way. You
    should not wear too much makeup to school, because it will make you
    look fake. Wear a little more makeup than usual to parties and on
    weekends if you
    like!![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_15.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_15.jpg")
3.  Follow the school rules. If your school does have a rule about no
    makeup, then don't break it! You could get in trouble and it would
    *not* end
    well.![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_16.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_16.jpg")

### Keeping Clean

1.  Use shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. You can get these at stores
    such as Bath and Body Works. You can also use Lush facial products;
    they work very
    well!![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_17.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_17.jpg")
2.  Wash your face. You don't need million dollar soaps, but a scrub or
    soap will be good. Make sure it is oil free to prevent acne. If your
    mother has pimple cream, then use
    it!![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_18.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_18.jpg")
3.  Shower every day. If you're a girl over ten, then it's time you
    start showering every day. Use conditioner and shampoo, plus a body
    wash or any other products you
    like.![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_19.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_19.jpg")
4.  Have fun. Keeping clean should be fun! You can use bath bombs,
    sprays, and other fun
    things.![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_20.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_20.jpg")

### Being Confident

1.  Be confident. Remember that confidence is key. The coolest style
    imaginable would not be complete without a proud, smiling face.
    Never be mean, but that doesn't mean giving fake compliments! Always
    be kind, nice, and polite. Say please and thank you, and remember: a
    smile is the *best*
    style!![](Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_21.jpg "fig:Be_Fashion_Forward_(for_Tweens)_Step_21.jpg")

## Tips

-   Don't ever let anyone tell you how to be cool, what you do is your
    choice!
-   Try new things with your hair, like a braid or pig tails!
-   Don't think of this as a 'road to popularity'. Its just a way to get
    in touch with your inner style.
-   If somebody says they think your style is lame just say," I'm
    awesome and I know it so don't be rude."
-   Make sure that the clothes you buy fit your schools dress code.

## Warnings

-   Some people may be rude and jealous, just look them in the eye and
    say 'If I wanted your opinion, I would have asked for it.' and leave
    it at that
-   Your parents may not approve of certain 'looks' you want to try out.
    Respect their wishes and find another way to be original.
