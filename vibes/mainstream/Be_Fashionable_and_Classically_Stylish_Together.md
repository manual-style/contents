Do you want to follow fashion, but retain your dignity? Do you feel as
if dressing classically will make you look old fashioned? Some of
today's trends can be a little obscure, especially when hot off the
catwalk. This guide tells you how to sort out your wardrobe so you can
dress fashionably, without losing your class and style.

## Steps

1.  Send old clothing items to the charity shop, recycle them, or just
    throw them out! They have **no class** and will do you no favours.
    Some things to consider throwing out would
    be:![](Fold_Clothes_for_Travel_Step_4.jpg "fig:Fold_Clothes_for_Travel_Step_4.jpg")
    -   Skirts more than five inches above your knees.
    -   Heels more than three inches high.
    -   Boots higher than two inches above your knee.
    -   Things in fluorescent colours.
    -   Things with clashing prints e.g. lime green and orange is an
        extreme example.
    -   Crop tops and boob tubes, and tops with very low cut chests.
    -   Fishnet tights with large holes.
    -   Anything stained or ripped.
    -   Anything you haven't worn in two years. (You might as well
        spring clean the wardrobe, while you're clearing it out!)
2.  Now that you have done a major clean out, it's time to go shopping!
    Make sure you have these **key pieces** in your
    wardrobe:![](Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Yourself_and_Look_Good_(for_Girls)_Step_1.jpg")
    -   Black/blue/brown/white trousers (all of them) to go with any
        top.
    -   Three or more skirts, different colours.
    -   Three or more jackets, different colours.
    -   Many flat shoes, and two pairs with low heels.
    -   One pair of shoes with a higher heel.
3.  Having these quintessential items helps you stay on track whilst
    dressing in a [classy](Be_Classy "wikilink") way. Here's the fun
    part: You can buy **whatever fashion clothes you want**, from
    whatever store! As long as they aren't any of the things in the
    first list,
    anyway!![](Choose_Your_Prom_Dress_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Choose_Your_Prom_Dress_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Know that classy dressers have presentable legs. You can wear short
    skirts, but make sure your legs are fit to be seen if you aren't
    going to wear tights. That means hairless and with as few bruises as
    possible. It may be you don't want to shave your legs - if that's
    the case then don't have bare legs, as other people will see you as
    unseemly. Skirts with tights are
    fine.![](Layer_Clothes_Step_5.jpg "fig:Layer_Clothes_Step_5.jpg")
5.  Don't show too much skin. Bare skin is not classy, no matter how
    fashionable it may be. This is why you must not wear crop tops, mini
    shorts or miniskirts. It is not trashy to wear shorts with tights,
    as long as the colours don't clash and the shorts aren't too short.
    It is always trashy to wear crop tops. Classy people are far more
    reserved than
    that.![](Appear_Thinner_Without_Losing_Weight_Step_3.jpg "fig:Appear_Thinner_Without_Losing_Weight_Step_3.jpg")
6.  Understand that prints are very fashionable, but it's easy to go
    wrong. Try not to mix prints. Floral skirts should always be worn
    with plain tops. Printed tops should always be worn with plain
    trousers or skirts. And the colors have to complement each other -
    no pink flowery skirts with brown
    jackets!![](Layer_Clothes_Step_6.jpg "fig:Layer_Clothes_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Wear what suits you. It's useless trying to follow fashions for the
    sake of it. To redeem your classic, basic style, know your body
    shape and what colours suit your eye and hair colours. It's easy to
    throw together an outfit that looks great on the mannequin - but
    think. Is a denim waist cost really going to flatter you? Does it
    really go with that black flowery blouse? It may be sometimes that
    the overall effect of an outfit in a picture is nice, but alone the
    clothes don't appeal to you very much. So don't buy
    them!![](Appear_Thinner_Without_Losing_Weight_Step_5.jpg "fig:Appear_Thinner_Without_Losing_Weight_Step_5.jpg")
8.  Think of the classiest person you know. Let's say Audrey Hepburn. If
    she were around today, would she wear the outfit you're thinking of
    wearing? If not it's a good idea to think why, then modify your
    outfit to make it up to
    standard.![](Be_Fashionable_and_Classically_Stylish_Together_Step_8.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_and_Classically_Stylish_Together_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Being healthy and clean will help your classy appearance. Make sure
    you have great skin by drinking lots and using cleansing products;,
    use deodorants and shower or bathe daily! Body odour is not
    classy!![](Control_Your_Hair_Step_1.jpg "fig:Control_Your_Hair_Step_1.jpg")

## Tips

-   The basic rule you need to follow is this: Look smart, but not
    formal. Look intelligent, but not snobby. Look attractive yet subtle
    (never too overt). This is the secret of a classy outfit.

## Warnings

-   Don't go round telling people they look trashy. Classy people don't
    just dress well, they are nice and sophisticated too. Be
    conservative about your attitude as well as your clothes, or people
    will think you're a snob.
-   Don't be too reserved or you'll end up looking like your mother or
    grandmother. Classical doesn't mean old fashioned, it just means
    stylish and appropriate clothing.
-   Similarly, don't follow fashions simply because they're 'in'. Think
    about how you look. If you look trashy, don't buy it. If you can
    imagine yourself bumping into, say, the Queen, or your favourite
    celebrity - would you feel embarrassed? If so, you aren't classy
    enough!
