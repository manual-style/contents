Being fashionable is not always easy. Here are a few steps to feel good
about yourself while being fashionable and neat.

## Steps

1.  Be clean physically. This is a huge part because to feel clean can
    make you feel neat as well. Make sure to shower daily, but do not
    wash your hair everyday because you will dry out your hair and
    increase split
    ends.![](Be_Fashionable_and_Neat_As_a_Child_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_and_Neat_As_a_Child_Step_1.jpg")
    -   When showering, make sure to use a sponge or a little towel and
        apply a shower gel or soap. When washing your hair use a shampoo
        and a conditioner that suits your needs: dry, long term, treated
        hair, etc.
    -   Don't forget to cleanse your face and take off all your makeup.
        This will prevent breakouts.
    -   Don't forget to shave your armpits and your legs when in the
        shower. When you get out of the shower put lotion on your body.
2.  Maintain your look. Always pluck your eyebrows, at least between
    your two eyebrows. Also wax where there is unwanted hair. Waxing
    your legs or arm pits may be painful but it will last 28 days at
    least or you can stick with
    shaving.![](Be_Fashionable_and_Neat_As_a_Child_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_and_Neat_As_a_Child_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Do not wear anything too grown up! Do not walk around in heels,
    fishnet stockings, and a short
    dress.![](Be_Fashionable_and_Neat_As_a_Child_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_and_Neat_As_a_Child_Step_3.jpg")
    -   Have at least 3 pairs of blue jeans. Never get extreme colors
        and stay away from patterns. Blue jeans are versatile and can be
        used in lots of ways.
    -   Get age- appropriate skirts: nothing too tight and have it at
        least the length of where your fingertips touch at your sides.
        Now moving on to shirts!
    -   Don't get anything too low cut. Try to get solid everyday colors
        that flatter your skin. Also get those colors in tank tops.
    -   Also get at least two belts because they are great out fit
        completer. Two more clothing items are sweat pants and sweat
        shirts.
4.  Never dye your hair extreme colors if you are looking for a clean
    look. Try to get a hair cut that will match your face shape as
    well.![](Be_Fashionable_and_Neat_As_a_Child_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_and_Neat_As_a_Child_Step_4.jpg")
    -   Stay away from dying or bleaching hair because it will only
        damage your hair. Don't always wear your hair straight or curly.
        Try many different things and tools.
    -   Try a curling iron, a wand curling iron, and straightening iron.
5.  Wear a simple makeup. Use a little concealer on dark circle and
    pimples. Use foundation if you want a more flawless look and if you
    need it. Then put on a little blush on your cheeks to add color and
    then you are
    done.![](Be_Fashionable_and_Neat_As_a_Child_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_and_Neat_As_a_Child_Step_5.jpg")

## Tips

-   Try to look presentable EVERY day.
-   Shower either in the morning or night. Never let your hair look
    greasy.
-   Try to plan outfits the night before so you don't have to waste time
    in the morning while you could be eating breakfast.
-   Never wear your clothes two days in a a row. It's very nasty.
