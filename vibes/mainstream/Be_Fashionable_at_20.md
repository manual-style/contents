Every wardrobe has gaps, but a wardrobe that can provide a suitable
outfit 95% of the time is a must for women or men of any age. Your 20s
might be a particularly appropriate time to focus on your wardrobe: you
are beginning to have a good understanding of who you are and are not
subjected to the peer pressure and fads that come with high school, and
you (likely) have more disposable income than you ever will again.

## Steps

1.  Understand that creating a strong wardrobe is going to take some
    money. You don't have to buy designer brands, but remember that
    investing in well-made items, especially classic foundation pieces
    like suit jackets etc., means that these pieces will serve you for
    years to come and will look less shabby after a while than if you
    had opted for the cheaper version. Therefore, create a budget:
    earmark funds, based on an assessment of what you need and what you
    would be comfortable spending. This can be a lump sum or a smaller
    monthly amount. Having the money previously set aside will mean less
    guilt when you begin to
    shop.![](Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you find it difficult to spend the money, plan your shopping
        trips around events. Buy something new to wear to the party your
        friend is having next Friday or for the company Christmas party.
        Make sure it is something you can wear in your day to day life
        and possibly blends into your existing wardrobe.
    -   Shop at charity shops; they're cheap and you can find some
        really nice clothes.
2.  Assess your needs. As you go about your daily and weekly routine,
    keep a list of the situations for which you frequently find yourself
    dressing. For example, if you are single and working in an
    administrative setting, you may need to dress for the office, for
    casual weekends running errands, for a date here and there and for
    nights out with the girls. As you find yourself in these settings,
    make mental notes of how others around you are dressing and you will
    get begin to get an idea of the level of formality required for the
    many situations in your life. Based on this, you can flesh out a
    very rough list of what type of completed outfits that you require
    everyday: skirt/blouse/heels for work, jeans/casual sweater/runners
    for Saturdays,
    etc.![](Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Buying only one or two pieces at a time and knowing exactly when
        you will wear them might help your frugal side to justify the
        expense. Plus, the compliments you receive might make you more
        confident in future purchases.
3.  Think about your personal style. Keep an eye on what others in your
    age group are wearing (on the subway, at the office, at the bar) but
    don't just try to copy them. Decide if you do or don't like the
    ruffled bohemian skirt, the flat knee-high boot, or the retro
    sunglasses. Don't be afraid to buy fashionable items if you really
    like them, but don't just buy them because everyone else is.
    Instead, try to get a feel for your own style and view your
    fashion-watching only as potential exposure to new
    ideas.![](Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   There are some basic articles that every woman should have: a
        pant or skirt suit, a pair of heels and a pair of flats, a
        formal dress coat for fall and winter and a decent handbag.
4.  Go shopping. Devote some time when you will not be tired and can be
    out as long as you like, i.e Saturday or Sunday. But remember,
    shopping is supposed to be fun! So if you are feeling overwhelmed or
    frustrated, simply browse and don't pressure yourself to buy. You do
    not yet have a clear enough idea of what you need or
    want.![](Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Ask for help and advice from staff, especially when it comes to
    fittings. An objective eye can help determine if something really
    does fit right or if you just wish it did. Friends are good for this
    too, but make sure they are not just trying to be
    nice.![](Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Bras are an important component to how tops fit. It is important
        to know your proper bra size. Most good lingerie shops and
        department stores should be able to help you with this.
6.  Keep in mind how the pieces you buy will fit in with the rest of
    your wardrobe. Create many outfits from a few basic pieces with
    interchangeable items. Try to maintain an even balance of neutrals
    and
    colors.![](Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
7.  Accessories are your friends. An inexpensive piece of costume
    jewelry or a scarf can brighten up the dullest outfit, giving you an
    opportunity to assert your new-found sense of style. Target (in the
    U.S.), Old Navy and H&M are all great sources of inexpensive costume
    jewelry.![](Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Don't forget the
    shoes!![](Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
9.  Have fun and try new cosmetics. Unless you work in a creative
    setting, keep the daytime make-up understated and pull off funky,
    glam looks at night. Again, discount stores (like pharmacies) allow
    you to experiment. This way, you can find out if blue eyeshadow
    works for you without breaking the
    bank.!![](Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_Fashionable_at_20_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")

## Tips

-   Don't waste your money buying an item just because it is on
    clearance and a "good deal". If it doesn't fit right, doesn't look
    good on you, and you never wear it, it isn't a good deal no matter
    how cheap it is.
-   Watching "What Not To Wear" Can help you find a balance between
    colors and neutrals, tell you what "goes" and what "matches" and
    help you find appropriate clothes for the occasion and for your body
    type. TiVo the shows and watch when alone. Take notes if you really
    have to. Stacey and Clinton will guide you through it. Keep in mind
    that if there's a showing about a someone who wears too much black,
    and you don't, watching it may not be appropriate. Watch showings
    with people who dress similarly too you. You can watch the others,
    but pay more attention to the ones you really need.
-   If you see something that you do not need but you absolutely love
    it, don't buy it right away. If you are still thinking about it in
    three days, you can go back and get it. Impulse buys are tricky:
    sometimes the immediate reaction is unfounded and you might end up
    with something you never wear; however, some things I have bought on
    impulse and ended up wearing for years. Try to develop an informed
    gut instinct and trust it.
-   If you find that you can never get the right size, consider whether
    you should try a specialty store. Don't be ashamed to shop at a plus
    size store: clothes that fit you properly do much more to camouflage
    your weight than clothes that are too small, which simply accentuate
    your measurements. There are stores for tall women, petite women and
    overweight women: use them, and ask for help from the salespeople.
-   Ask people who are of the same proportions as you and who are
    wearing a great item where they shop. Le Chateau occasionally has
    dress pants in a 34" leg.
-   A wardrobe is an ever evolving thing. Make shopping a regular
    activity, and keep your eyes open even when you are not specifically
    shopping for clothes.

## Warnings

-   Don't buy for imaginary situations. For example, if you are a
    student but think that one day you'd like to work in an office,
    don't buy all office wear. But if you are graduating soon and know
    you will be doing interviews, a suit is a must.
