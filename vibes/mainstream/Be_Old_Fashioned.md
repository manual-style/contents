It is not a bad idea to be old-fashioned. It helps you to learn about
history; how people spoke in the past, what they wore and what they ate.
If you want to be old fashioned, just read these steps below.

## Steps

1.  Try to wear old-fashioned clothes. Sometimes it is hard to find
    these sort of clothes, and if you really cannot find any old
    clothes, try to make your own. This is easy and fun, if you know how
    to sew and knit. Finding old-fashioned boy clothes is quite easy
    because all you need is a smart suit. Girls are harder, but you
    could buy a fancy dress
    costume.![](Be_Old_Fashioned_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_Old_Fashioned_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Try and eat old fashioned too. You don't have to entirely stop
    eating things they didnâ€™t have in the era you're trying to emulate,
    but you should try to eat them less. This includes fizzy drinks
    (cola), new sweets (Wham bar). Try to eat old food such as bread or
    cheese and try drinking milk or water more
    often.![](Be_Old_Fashioned_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Old_Fashioned_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Speak in an old fashioned way. If you want people to notice you are
    trying to be old fashioned, try speaking posh. Use words like shall,
    stupendous, flabbergasted, ridicule, marvellous, leisurely, indeed
    and
    'tis.![](Be_Old_Fashioned_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_Old_Fashioned_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Act like a true Victorian. Sit up straight instead of slouching,
    Don't be rude, and if you are make sure somebody gives you a ticking
    off. Make sure no-one whacks you with a cane
    though!![](Be_Old_Fashioned_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Old_Fashioned_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Try to know about old customs and beliefs too. They can help your
    attitude.![](Be_Old_Fashioned_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_Old_Fashioned_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Just try and be yourself. If you think you are a modern person, and
    that you like the way you were made, try and keep it that
    way.![](Be_Old_Fashioned_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_Old_Fashioned_Step_6.jpg")
