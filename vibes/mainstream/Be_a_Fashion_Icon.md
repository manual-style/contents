Being a fashion icon means setting trends and staying stylish for years
to come. Fashion icons are diverse and unique, so it is important to be
authentic as possible when developing your personal style. Becoming an
icon takes hard work, passion, and patience, so never give up during the
process. To become a fashion icon, you should do your research, develop
your style, and work towards success for as long as you can.

## Steps

### Doing Your Research

1.  Learn what being a fashion icon means. Of course, being a fashion
    icon means setting future trends. It also means being timeless in
    your style. Being a fashion icon, however, extends beyond style.
    Icons want to shape and influence culture. So along with
    understanding fashion, stay up-to-date on current events, research
    history, and develop a personal
    philosophy.![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Essentially, your life should be more about fashion to truly be
        an icon. Be interested in things like philosophy, trends outside
        of fashion, and current events.
2.  Write down a list of words you want to describe your look. Take some
    time to consider what look and “vibe” you want to portray. Then,
    write down a list of words that correspond with what type of style
    you’d like to achieve. Some words could be “cute,” “contemporary,”
    or “eccentric.” The words could also have nothing to do with
    looks.[1]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
    -   For example, you could write down words like “space,”
        “architecture,” or “painting.”
3.  Look up fashion icons. You need to be unique to be a fashion icon,
    but it’s also important to be knowledgeable about past and current
    fashion icons. Research a wide array of fashion icons. You can do
    this by googling “fashion icons” and by looking through books on
    fashion history at the library. You don’t have to like the icon’s
    style to appreciate their contribution to
    fashion.[2]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   A few traditional fashion icons are Mick Jagger, Marilyn Monroe,
        Diana Ross, and Marlon Brando.
    -   A few other, more artistic fashion icons are David Bowie, Elton
        John, and Lady Gaga.[3]
4.  Choose your inspirations. Once you’ve done research on fashion
    icons, choose a few icons to draw inspiration from. Even fashion
    icons drew their inspiration from someone or somewhere. You can be
    inspired by an icon, but still be unique. If the icon is from the
    past, read about them and look at pictures. If the fashion icon is
    current, stay up-to-date on their
    style.[4]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   You can stay up-to-date on their style by reading fashion
        magazines and following their social media.
5.  Research fashion history. Beyond knowing about fashion icons, you
    should also learn about fashion history. That includes fashion from
    centuries ago, the past few decades, and today—even though today is
    not technically history yet. You can check out books about fashion
    from the library, take a class at a college, or simply research it
    online.[5]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
    -   You can also watch documentaries and go to fashion history
        museums.
    -   You should draw inspiration from fashion history as well.
6.  Stay up-to-date on fashion trends. Buy magazines like Elle, Vogue,
    and Harper's Bazaar. Look at the pictures and read the articles.
    Mark the pages of what styles you like and create a scrapbook out of
    the magazines for future use. As you stay up-to-date on the trends
    try to predict what trends will happen in the
    future.[6]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_6_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_6_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Choose a few key looks that will suit your lifestyle and body
        type, and implement them into your current wardrobe.

### Developing Your Style

1.  Experiment with your style. Unless you’ve already developed your own
    unique style, you should start and then continue to experiment with
    your style. First, try something you wouldn’t normally wear, like a
    color that you usually don’t like. Then, step up the
    experimentation. For example, you could wear a mechanic’s uniform
    and match it with accessories for a
    day.![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_7_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_7_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Your experiments may ultimately be a failure, but it is
        necessary to fail, even fail many times, on the path to becoming
        an icon.
2.  Put your list of words into action. Go back to the list of words you
    wrote down that you wanted to describe your look. For example, the
    words may have been something like “futuristic” or “renaissance.”
    Now, look for clothing and accessories that would fall into the
    category of “futuristic,” “renaissance,” or whatever your words may
    have been. The clothing doesn’t have to be stereotypical of the
    words. It is all up to your
    interpretation.[7]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_8_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_8_Version_3.jpg")
3.  Take risks. Fashion risks are very important when it comes to being
    a style icon. You can’t be an influencer if you stay comfortable.
    Taking risks helps you grow, stay creative, and ultimately, they get
    you noticed. A couple fashion risks you could try are wearing all
    bright orange or turning pajamas into outwear. In the end, the
    fashion risk should stem from your own
    creativity.[8]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_9_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_9_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Fashion risks will never be something that is currently trendy.
4.  Learn to [make clothing.](Make_Clothing "wikilink") This isn’t
    necessary, but it will help if you want to be truly unique when it
    comes to fashion. Making your own clothing will ensure that no one
    else in the world wears the same thing as you. Start designing your
    own clothes by drawing them or using a computer program. Then, learn
    how to sew your
    creations.[9]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_10_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_10_Version_3.jpg")
    -   If you get good at it, you could start making clothing for other
        people and even create your own clothing line.
5.  Shop at a wide variety of stores. You shouldn’t shop at just one
    place when developing your personal style. If you do, then you are
    essentially a model for a designer. Instead, shop at a wide variety
    of stores. Shop at thrift stores, high-end stores, and even
    department stores. Mix your fashion so the inspiration becomes
    untraceable.[10]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_11.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_11.jpg")
6.  Choose a signature accessory. Many fashion icons have a recognizable
    accessory that makes them easily identifiable. For example, Jackie
    Kennedy Onassis could be identified by her signature gloves. Think
    about something that would pair well with your personal style. You
    could choose big sunglasses, a bow, or a unique
    ring.[11]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_12.jpg")
    -   You could also choose to have quirky socks as your signature
        accessory.
7.  Pick a unique hairstyle. It’s not necessary, but many fashion icons
    have a signature hairstyle that they’ve stuck with throughout the
    years. Betsey Johnson, Anna Wintour, Susy Menkes are a few examples.
    Your signature hair could be bright pink, shaved off, or very
    long.[12]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_13.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_13.jpg")

### Working towards Success

1.  Develop a presence on social media. Having a strong social media
    presence is almost necessary when it comes to being a fashion
    influencer in today’s society. Become active on social media
    platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, and Snapchat. Post your
    daily outfits and even create a fashion blog to give advice to
    others.[13]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_14.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_14.jpg")
    -   Make sure to post at least once a day.
    -   Follow a lot of people at first to try to get yourself noticed.
2.  Get to know other people in the industry. It is important to develop
    relationships with other people that are influential in the fashion
    industry. Reach out to fashion bloggers on social media and attend
    fashion events in attempt to get to know these people. Make sure to
    compliment other stylish people, and they will start noticing what
    you
    wear.[14]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_15.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_15.jpg")
    -   You should also cultivate friendships with people that may be
        successful in the future.
3.  Further your education. Your education should never end if you want
    to be an icon. Always try to stay hungry for more information about
    fashion. If possible, get a degree in fashion or at least attend a
    few fashion classes. If that isn’t possible, continue researching
    fashion and learning from influential
    people.[15]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_16.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_16.jpg")
    -   Learn about fashion forecasting so that you can be ahead of the
        game.
    -   Try to get an internship or study under a designer to learn more
        and cultivate relationships.
4.  Stick with your style. Once you’ve developed a style you love, stick
    with it. A common denominator amongst fashion icons is that they
    didn’t stray from their personal style. They may have slightly
    altered it through the years, but they always stayed
    recognizable.[16]![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_17.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_17.jpg")
5.  Be [confident.](Be_Confident "wikilink") You will experience
    hardship over time, but it is important to stay confident. People
    are more likely to notice you if you appear confident. Plus,
    confidence will boost your determination, and to be a fashion icon,
    you need
    determination.![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_18.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_18.jpg")
6.  Stay [persistent.](Be_Persistent "wikilink") Along with confidence,
    you need to be persistent and patient. You shouldn’t be annoying and
    overbearing, but you should never give up. Don’t give up even if you
    experience multiple failures over many years. Believe that you will
    achieve success in the end. Never be afraid to put yourself out
    there. Fashion icons didn’t become icons
    overnight.![](Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_19.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Icon_Step_19.jpg")
