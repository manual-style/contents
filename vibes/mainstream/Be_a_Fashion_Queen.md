Contrary to popular belief, "fashionable" does not mean a logo tee and
jeans. Fashion is about expressing yourself.

## Steps

1.  Be aware of trends. Read magazines. Make sure that these are
    *fashion* magazines, not entertainment, general interest, or teen
    magazines. Examples include Lucky, Teen Vogue, Vogue, Elle, and
    NYLON. Note items or colors that seem to appear in multiple
    magazines. Remember, the goal isn't to buy the exact items of
    clothing from magazines, but to be inspired to look for something
    similar or to pull things together in a similar way. Read fashion
    blogs and look at photos from runway shows on Style.com for further
    trendsetter information.

2.  Say no to logos. Logos are for boring, unfashionable people who want
    to show off how much their clothing cost. You can wear logos if they
    are on a cute item, or contribute to the overall aesthetic (ie. "See
    by Chloe" written in small gold letters on a leather bag) but don't
    go for anything too obvious like an Ed Hardy
    tee.![](Be_a_Fashion_Queen_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Queen_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Don't be a stereotype. Unfortunately, there is a widely held belief
    that girls who like fashion are dumb or spoiled. You might need to
    work extra hard to convince people that you are indeed intelligent
    as well as
    well-dressed.![](Be_a_Fashion_Queen_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Queen_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Draw inspiration from the past Designers are constantly
    reinterpreting vintage styles and you should do the same. Try a
    vintage scarf with a tee and jeans or a 50's inspired dress for a
    school
    dance.![](Be_a_Fashion_Queen_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashion_Queen_Step_4.jpg")
