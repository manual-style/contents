To have a great fashion sense you need to do all of the below...

## Steps

### color coordinate

1.  In fashion you need to color coordinate. For example, if you are
    wearing a red top wear a skirt roughly the same color and not a neon
    yellow skirt. However, sometimes you can mix and match colours.
    **Shades of colors are very important here.**

### suitable clothes

1.  Always wear suitable clothes for the weather and/or occasion because
    you would look like an idiot if you wore a halloween costume in the
    winter.
2.  Always wear suitable clothes for the weather and/or occasion since
    you would look ridiculous if you wore a halloween costume on
    Christmas

### On Trend

1.  Make sure you are wearing clothes that are on trend. Even though
    it'sÂ  got to stand out of the crowd and look different but if
    everyone has the same coat and yours is different you will feel
    stupid.
2.  It is important to be on trend at all times. Even though it's good
    to stand out from the crowd and be unique if everybody has the same
    coat and yours looks different you WILL get laughed at and feel
    stupid.
