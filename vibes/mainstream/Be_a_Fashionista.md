A fashionista is someone who looks at fashion as a form of art. If you
want to learn to follow fashion and look great, you can learn how to
stay up on current fashion trends, as well as how to build a stylish
wardrobe that will have you turning heads.

## Steps

### Staying Current

1.  Look for fashion inspiration everywhere. Fashion is all around us,
    and by reading, watching and learning new things about the world and
    fashion, you will be inspired and in time become a fashionista.
    Start looking at the world as your canvas and create, whether it be
    by styling different clothing garments together, or sketching ideas
    of clothing garments you'd like to recreate or find in a
    store.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Keep your eyes open for fashion. Fashionistas may be equally
        influenced by Gucci as by music, fine art, or poetry. Think
        about fashion as an art form, if you want to be real
        fashionista.
2.  Stay up on the trends in the industry. Watch what celebs and
    designers are wearing, and try to recreate those looks into your
    daily outfits as a fashionista. Try not to copy the looks exactly,
    but try to put your spin on
    things.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Knowing what’s coming will really help you out in getting the
        goods before stores realize they can charge you twice as much as
        it is worth.
    -   Look for things you've never seen before, and wouldn't
        necessarily buy at first. When you see what's coming into new
        stores that you find strange, it might mean that this is the
        next big thing.
3.  Do your fashion research on social media. On your personal Facebook,
    Twitter, and Instagram pages, follow as many style and fashion icons
    as possible. This way, you can get instant fashion updates at your
    fingertips. Search popular fashion hashtags and regularly go digging
    for new and surprising style inspirations
    online.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Pinterest and Wanelo are great fashion-forward social networking
        pages that can help connect you with the fashion world. Start a
        profile and start saving things you like until you begin to
        develop a style you like that is all your own. Check out the
        "recommended" clothes that are near the things you save.
    -   In Wanelo, you can go to the "Magic" section which provides
        things they think you'll like based on your recent saves.
4.  Buy fashion magazines. Fashion magazines are one of the classic
    touchstones of being a fashionable person. Particularly look out for
    magazines like Vogue or Marie Claire where the photography of the
    adverts can be as informative as the articles themselves. Magazines
    can give you some basic information about the fashion
    world.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Carefully examine the details on photos. What is in now and what
        is not? Discover new fashion trends. Pay attention to the way of
        clothing and allow it to inspire you as to how you can wear your
        own clothes.
    -   Can't afford to subscribe to that many fashion magazines? Read
        them at the bookstore, or head to the library and check out
        their subscription.

### Building Your Wardrobe

1.  Buck trends. If you want to be a fashionista, you don't have to like
    what everyone is wearing. By the time you figure out what's trendy
    and start dressing like other people, it'll be old hat. You don't
    have to look like the trend-setters out there, and you shouldn't
    want to. Aim to have your own
    style.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Get some solid essentials. Don’t just go out and buy a bunch of
    really cool pieces that match with one thing in your closet. You
    will soon feel that you are running out of clothes when truthfully
    you just bought a ton of statement pieces like a cool floral skirt
    with no plain tops to match it
    with.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_6.jpg")
    -   Get things like camisoles, plain sweaters and cardigans, a plain
        skirt, and a few neutral-colored dresses, so you'll have as many
        options as possible to match. If you aren't quite ready for wild
        colors, just go with black to make sure you'll have choices.
3.  Get plenty of shoe options. The right pair of shoes can make or
    break a fashionable outfit. Even a simple pair of form-fitting jeans
    with a cute top can look suddenly spiced up with a surprising pair
    of pumps. Shoes should be cute and comfortable, and you should have
    a variety of them to spice up your different
    looks.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_7.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_7.jpg")
    -   Boots are super important. They always elongate the leg and make
        you look super toned. They also can go almost all year long.
        They are classic and won’t go out of style.
    -   A cute but casual pair of flats is important for any wardrobe.
        That does not mean running sneakers.
    -   Invest in a great pair of heels that will last a long time. Then
        you can get other ones you just like for some special occasions.
4.  Shop smart. Fashion's a great hobby, as long as you can afford it.
    If you're on a budget, it's important to set a particular amount out
    of your funds that you're allowed to spend on money per month and
    stay strictly in that limit. You don't have to sacrifice style for
    cash, though, and you can learn to find quality items for
    cheap.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_8.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_8.jpg")
    -   Price items at different stores and always go back and compare.
        Don't go just to one fashion store and settle for what you find.
        Make sure you do the rounds and keep track of different items
        you hope to purchase.
    -   Find the right stores. You can always splurge once and a while
        on a real statement piece that you know is something you'll
        never find anywhere else but try to stay within that budget.
        There’s a difference between Fashionista and shopaholic.
5.  Learn how to accessorize properly. Jewelry, cute hats, earrings,
    necklaces, and bracelets are helpful in allowing you to create
    different looks from the same items in your wardrobe. Find what
    looks right for you and look at the outfit as a whole in the mirror
    with it so you don't over accessorize by
    mistake.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_9.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Invest in affordable scarves, jewelry, and shoes to accessorize
        your outfits. They make a big difference in any simple outfit,
        and you can get away with having a wide variety of cheap items
        that accent your other pieces.
6.  [Learn how to sew and make your own
    garments](Make_Clothing "wikilink"). When you truly develop your own
    style, sometimes you'll picture such an ideal outfit and you go on a
    mad hunt for it. And you won't find it. Instead of being
    disappointed, learn how to make it yourself! You can learn to mend
    your favorite items and keep them looking fresh and new, as well as
    how to make up new items as you go along, just for the cost of
    materials. This can be a real cost-saver, and a great way to make
    statements.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_10.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_10.jpg")
7.  Purge your wardrobe regularly. Every couple of months, it's
    important to get rid of clothes you won't wear anymore. Give old
    clothes to charity, or have "Naked Lady" parties, in which you get
    together with a bunch of your fashionable friends and trade items
    you don't want
    anymore.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_11.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_11.jpg")
    -   You can save interesting T-shirts, or old jeans which are not
        popular now if you think you can combine it with some other
        things to get unique look, but it's usually easier to purge
        focus on working with what you like in the here and now.

### Getting Dressed

1.  Learn to mix and match the clothes you already have. A lot of people
    assume you need the latest trends to be fashionable, but this
    doesn't necessarily have to be true. If you mix a plain white
    t-shirt with denim jeans one day and a black pencil skirt another,
    you've got two outfits right there made with a minimum of
    items.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Practice organizing your clothes into different looks when
        you've got free-time. Spend some quality mirror time trying on
        different things together and experimenting to see what you
        looks right.
2.  Find out what looks good on you and what doesn't. Something might be
    fashionable in general, but it's not right for you and your body
    type. That's ok. It's important to figure out not only what's
    stylish and what's "in," but what's going to look good on
    you.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_13.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_13.jpg")
    -   It's good to spend time in front of mirror discovering the
        perfect combination of items for you. Find out the clothes which
        [defines your body shape
        best](Dress_for_Your_Body_Type "wikilink") and will help accent
        your best features.
3.  Wear what makes you feel confident. To be a fashionista you need to
    be confident. The number one rule in fashion is to wear what you
    want to wear, so always wear what you want and choose items that
    will help you feel comfortable and
    radiant.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_14.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_14.jpg")
    -   Hold your head up high and improve that posture. People started
        to notice that you're dressed nice if you're walking with your
        head up. Be proud and get noticed.
    -   Don't wear something just because it's "fashionable," or because
        someone recommended it. Fashion changes. If you used to love
        wearing blazers a year ago, but now you want to try leather
        jackets, go for it. Life is short and a fashionista should
        always wears what she wants.
4.  Don't over-do it. Although runway fashion can be very over-the-top
    and glamorous, sometimes less is more. You don't need to wear a
    fancy dress to school to be a fashionista. Just be yourself and find
    clothing that you feel represent you, and make you feel beautiful
    and
    confident.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_15.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_15.jpg")
    -   Try and separate runway fashion from everyday fashion. The
        designers of those elaborate garments are mostly wearing normal
        everyday clothes, just like you. Keep that in mind.
5.  Have a positive attitude. Fashionistas need to mimic the beauty your
    fashions exudes on the outside by being beautiful on the inside.
    Being a fashionista means nothing if your attitude is not positive.
    Be happy, and enjoy life. Fashion is wonderful, but brand names and
    style aren't everything. Learn to be you and love you, and soon your
    inner fashionista will
    shine.![](Be_a_Fashionista_Step_16.jpg "fig:Be_a_Fashionista_Step_16.jpg")

    T-shirt with jeans if you have appropriate accessories.
