So, all of your bffs have fantastic clothes and you hate your clothes.
It's normal, if your struggling to convince your parents your clothes
aren't cool enough, don't worry I've got you covered. :))

## Steps

### Asking your parents

1.  just straight out ask if you can go shopping. If your parents won't
    let you go with another relative. Or shop online
2.  if your parents say no because they don't want to spend their own
    money, save up. If you already have an allowance just work until you
    have enough money or if you don't, ask for one, they will most
    likely say yes people love other people doing work for them.

### Shopping

1.  ask your friends where they shop.where you shop depends on where you
    live but if your in the Southern Hemisphere some cool clothes shops
    to shop at are Factorie, Supr√©, ValleyGirl, SportsGirl, Kmart,
    Target, Big W and Myers :))
2.  make sure you have enough money, don't forget to bring it!!! Be
    careful for what you buy always double check on the price

### Showing off your new clothes

1.  if your school has a uniform like mine, wait until a day with free
    choice of clothes but if your school doesn't have a uniform well
    your lucky and you can show off all your clothes

### Making things match

1.  to make things match make sure you don't have too much of one
    colour.ask friends for advice if your not sure.I personally don't
    like wearing thongs/flip flops to school (we aren't even aloud) but
    it's up to you choose your own style :)) be who you are !

## Tips

-   Do NOT change who you are if you like the clothes you wear these
    tips are only if you don't like the clothes you wear :))

## Warnings

-   People might make fun of you, just tell them your happy with the way
    you look and walk off :))
