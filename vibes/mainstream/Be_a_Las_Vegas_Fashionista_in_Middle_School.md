In a melting pot city such as Las Vegas, there are many young women who
dress very differently. Some dressing alike (with the same brands)
groups them in stereotypes. If you want to be a glamorous and original
'fashionista' in a big school like yours, this is the guide for you!

## Steps

1.  Review your school dress code carefully: It does not feel good to be
    dress-coded in a school where you are trying to set the
    trends.![](Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Look into your closet, drawers, and other places where you keep your
    clothing: Ideal things you would want to look for would be things
    appealing to you. Be adequate in your choices. An example of
    inadequacy would be a plain T-shirt with simple designs. Those are
    good for when playing sports. Otherwise, read on. Adequacy would be
    a piece of clothing that has interesting styles and cuts (still in
    dress
    code).![](Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Shopping is an interesting part of a fashionista: Some popular Las
    Vegas preps would shop at Hollister and A+F. Those brands are okay
    to wear, however, are overly used. Designer brands such as BCBG,
    Escada, Juicy Couture, and other high class brands are good for a
    varied closet. However, don't spend all your parent's money on
    overly-priced jeans. Remember, not everyone is rich and you want to
    keep a mixed wardrobe. Some cheaper brands for you would be more
    obscure brands such as Wet Seal, Forever21, Roxy, and Charlotte
    Russe. Be careful about Wet Seal and Forever21, some of their
    clothing can be quite cheap and mediocre. If you shop at department
    stores such as TJ Maxx, Walmart, Target, Marshalls, or Ross, pay
    attention to what you buy. These stores come with an advantage
    though, as their clothing is extremely varied and rarely runs
    out.![](Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Be interesting about your clothing choices: Most "preps" would wear
    layered shirts and a pair of skinny jeans w/ flats. Try to avoid
    that style. Choose clothing that is interesting towards your fit,
    and makes you stand out if you were to stand in a group of
    preps.![](Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Have a mixed style in lower wear: Make sure your jeans are good
    quality. Charlotte Russe has good fit jeans ranging in short,
    regular, and long. Get a couple of Bermuda shorts, jean minis,
    normal jeans, crops, capris, and be minimal on the skinny jeans. For
    instance, you can wear normal jeans for some time, and then shock
    people by wearing a pair of skinny
    jeans.![](Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Footwear does not have to be as varied as the shirt and lower wear,
    but it is preferred: Examples of classy footwear would be plain
    flats. These are completely dress code, and also flirty. A pair of
    Converse All-Stars and slip-ons such as Vans are good, too. And in
    the winter, a pair of Uggs or furry boots pair great with tucked-in
    capris. Be careful on the peep-toe flats, for they might or might
    not be a part of the dress code. Heels/wedges shouldn't go past
    three
    inches.![](Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
7.  Be careful on accessories: Classy jewelry would include real gold,
    silver, sterling silver, white gold, and other real materials.
    Tiffany and Co. is a good place to get a designer quality sterling
    silver necklace, but it can cost around three-hundred dollars.
    Pearls and diamond studs are good. If you can only afford fake
    jewelry, buy some that looks wooden. Keep the fashion diamonds small
    and unnoticeable. If your ear is pierced more than one time, avoid
    wearing more than one "huge"
    earring.![](Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Get a purse: A tote bag is overly common, and tends to repeat itself
    among people. Purses can be used to hold school supplies, but also
    make-up and other things you might need. Good brands would be Coach,
    Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, Dolce and Gabbana, and other designer
    brands. Don't buy a fake purse. You can get cute, fashionable purses
    from the cheaper stores listed above, but make sure it comes in
    co-ordinable
    colors.![](Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
9.  Go different on the makeup: One of the most important steps in
    make-up is to make sure that you are not allergic to it first, so
    make sure to lightly test it. Some good brands would be Revlon,
    Almay, L'Or√©al, Covergirl, and Maybelline. If you want high class,
    Escada and Urban Decay is the way to go. Most in the crowd would
    line their eyes darkly in a rocker style. This is extremely
    unhealthy for the eyes. Instead, line the eye one time. Depending on
    your eye color, your liner color may vary (see "Tips"). Eyeshadow
    should be applied lightly so it won't clump up later in the day. A
    light blush is good for the cheeks, and gloss is ideal for younger
    women. Get fine quality mascara that won't clump up and is easy to
    apply.![](Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
10. Have your hair cut in a trendy style: Most "preps" would have their
    hair in a poofy rocker style. Instead, have your hair straight. This
    step is varied, depending on how you want your style. Make sure it
    compliments the shape of your face. People with long faces should go
    in a short
    style.![](Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
11. Be hygienic: Brush your teeth and gargle mouth wash every morning.
    Brush one more time before you head off to school. Make sure your
    hair is clean and not greasy looking, your nails are cut and painted
    reasonably, and that you shave
    regularly.![](Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
12. Remove acne from your face by using different products, depending on
    your skin: Proactive is good, but not recommended for people with
    gentle skin. If you have gentle skin, use a different acne treatment
    product. Goat-milk soap is a good
    alternative.![](Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
13. Hang out with whom you want to hang out with: This is for looks, not
    popularity.![](Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Las_Vegas_Fashionista_in_Middle_School_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")

## Tips

-   Take a shower before school starts, and give your hair enough time
    to dry. This leaves your hair silky and smooth.
-   Your color of eyeliner depends on your eye color. If you are
    blue/green-eyed, go with brown eyeliner. If you are
    brown/hazel/yellow-eyed, go with green or purple liner. And if you
    are grey-eyed, go with green liner. Black liquid liner is for older
    women, but is okay if applied lightly.

## Warnings

-   Bring your purse **everywhere** with you in school. Thieves are
    everywhere.
-   People might confuse you for a "prep". This will probably cause
    people to naturally hate you, so choose your friends wisely.
