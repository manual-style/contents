Always know how to be yourself. Never act like something that you're
not. It will just get you into trouble. If you are yourself then more
people will want to be and dress like you! If you want someone to dress
like you, this is how.

## Steps

1.  Leave your options open. Not too open though. Go through the clothes
    that you have and experiment hairstyles and makeup styles that work
    for
    you.![](Be_a_Unique_Fashion_Icon_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_a_Unique_Fashion_Icon_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Find your look. If you are tomboy then don't be girlie the next day.
    Change is good, but if you keep changing then you can't be a fashion
    icon to
    somebody.![](Be_a_Unique_Fashion_Icon_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Unique_Fashion_Icon_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Make sure that you are positive about your look. If somebody
    compliments you don't put yourself
    down.![](Be_a_Unique_Fashion_Icon_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Unique_Fashion_Icon_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Avoid blending in. You want to stand out! Be different. So what if
    your school mates are slack and don't care. If you do, and you keep
    dressing nice, people will get the urge to follow in your footsteps.
    And what feels better then to be a leader then a
    follower?![](Be_a_Unique_Fashion_Icon_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_a_Unique_Fashion_Icon_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Don't be afraid to express who you really are. You don't need to be
    someone you're not just for the people who you like. Be who you
    want, not who they want you to be! For the people that are reading
    this, they will probably want basics. But this advice is really
    helpful. Try it. Do it. Be a fashion icon. You never know what's in
    store up along your
    road.![](Be_a_Unique_Fashion_Icon_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_a_Unique_Fashion_Icon_Step_5.jpg")
