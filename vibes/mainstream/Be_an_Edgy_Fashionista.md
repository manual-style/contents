Have you ever browsed the teen fashion magazines and looked at the girls
whom in the fashion world had it all? Maybe you wanted to be envied by
others and basked in the glow of popularity? Or maybe you just wanted to
be a good fashion role model. Look no further, Fashionista, it's all
here!

## Steps

1.  Turn to the media! Make a small list of celebrities that you look up
    to ALWAYS! Look for those who have never failed you. Then, look in
    those magazines watch t.v, and jot down notes of some good fashion
    tips! (Example:Miley Cyrus has matched that animal print jacket with
    those boots
    well)![](Be_an_Edgy_Fashionista_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_an_Edgy_Fashionista_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Along with trends, you should have a unique style personally. Wear
    very bold patterns and weird colors, because you'll never know what
    looks good until you give it a test! Don't be afraid, that's why
    your "edgy"!
3.  Find out what size you are! Before going to the store, it's
    important to find out your size in case you want something, then
    you'll be 100% sure if you can get it or
    not!![](Be_an_Edgy_Fashionista_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_an_Edgy_Fashionista_Step_2.jpg")
4.  Compliment others and their personal style! It will mean a lot to
    them to receive compliments, especially from someone who knows what
    she's talking
    about!![](Be_an_Edgy_Fashionista_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_an_Edgy_Fashionista_Step_3.jpg")

## Tips

-   Be a creative person! Don't be afraid to design some of your own
    clothes!
-   Be a risk-taker! Fashion is all about expressing yourself no matter
    what anyone else thinks! So if you want to go mismatched one day, go
    for it!
-   Going to the hair and makeup salon may help too! Why not accessorize
    your outfit with some bling too? Example: Why not consider matching
    this diamond halter top with this beautiful diamond bracelet?
-   Get an outfit you feel comfortable in! Don't be afraid to wear
    normal jeans instead of skinny jeans! It can benefit you especially
    if those skinny jeans are really tight for your waist or any other
    place! You will actually look awkward in a result from feeling
    awkward and people can tell.
-   It's good to take tips from some celebrities, but my advice is you
    should NOT buy a name brand from a celeb, because you never know
    when they may make a mistake, destroy their reputation, and then you
    are stuck with their clothing never to wear again and you paid a
    large amount of wasted cash on it!
-   Remember that saying "Less Is more" that means to not go overboard
    in fashion and accessories! Don't make it your life!

## Warnings

-   Do not buy something that does not fit you. Buy something that you
    like, is comfortable, and you will fit you for years.
-   Do not copy every single thing your favorite celebrity(s) do! First
    of all, it will drive your friends insane, second, you are your own
    person, and third, people may start referring to you as a "poser" so
    just be yourself.
-   Make sure that your clothes are decent. Inappropriate clothing that
    shows off **too much skin** will not make you a good role model, you
    don't want to attract the kids in a wrong way.
