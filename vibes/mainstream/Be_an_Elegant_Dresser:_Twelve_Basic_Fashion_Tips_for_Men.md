We live in a hectic world in every sense, including fashion. The current
trends change constantly, and let’s face it – some of them simply look
like an application of assemble-what-you-have-in-the-wardrobe strategy.
Don’t get us wrong, there is nothing inherently vile about the negligee
style, but no one can argue that following certain dressing etiquette
comes with a certain class, style and sense of intransitive dignity. No
one says that you should look like as if you are just coming out of a
19th-century \[Gentlemen’s club in
London\][1](http://londonmanandvan.co/gentlemens-clubs-youd-want-to-be-a-member-of/)
at all times, but it does not hurt to be dressed appropriately,
right?Presented below are several dress-code rules, the most basic among
them, that will help you look stylish and elegant no matter what the
occasion.

## Steps

1.  White T-shirts and undershirts that remain visible when worn under a
    shirt are one of the greatest mood-killers. They immediately make
    your style look cheaper so don’t hesitate to drop them from your
    wardrobe. If you insist on wearing an undershirt, the market is with
    you – there are several brands of very nice invisible models that
    you can pick up from.
2.  ![](Ties.jpg "fig:Ties.jpg")The tie is a total must in every classy
    man’s attire. The general rule is that its length should be just
    enough to reach your trouser’s waistbands. Unfortunately, here comes
    the problem with low cut trousers and the risk that your tie becomes
    too long to look nice. This is one of the cases when you can ignore
    the above-mentioned golden rule. Remember, it is always better to go
    shorter when in doubt.
3.  While we are on the subject of ties, you should remember this fact –
    we are talking about an item of clothing that has no practical value
    at all. Ties cannot keep you warm, nor serve as a pocket. Their only
    function is the decorative one, which means that when you are
    wearing one, you cannot afford to make compromises with the state it
    is in. There could be not even a single wrinkle, and the knot should
    be properly made at all times.
4.  Black suits may make you feel like James Bond, but you should limit
    yourself to wearing them only at evening events or at funerals.
    Otherwise, go with a tuxedo that is in a different color.
5.  The rule of the thumb is that no suit that is bought off the rack
    could fit you perfectly. Bearing this in mind, you should approach
    buying already tailored suits carefully. Even if you think that you
    have found a perfect match that needs no alternations, bring it to a
    tailor who professionally evaluate it and make the necessary changes
    – we can bet on that there would be some. Most suits are easy to
    tailor according to your size and dimensions, but either way, try to
    get a jacket which shoulders are as close to your size as possible,
    since that’s what tailors usually find most difficult to alter
    properly.
6.  Belts are okey. Suspenders are also acceptable. The combination of
    the two however is a taboo for the good dresser. If you are wearing
    a vest, you should go for suspenders. The color of the belt has to
    match the color of your shoes.
7.  A double-breasted jacket is that kind of a jacket that has two
    overlapping front flaps with two parallel columns of buttons. If you
    are wearing one of those, you should button the bottom button. In
    case your jacket is single-breasted (e.g. it has just one column of
    buttons), the bottom one is to be left unbuttoned according to
    etiquette and sound fashion sense.
8.  Looking for a proper tuxedo jacket? Even though two or even three
    and four buttons are standard according to modern tailors, the
    classical approach remains the best – your tuxedo jacket just has to
    have a single button.
9.  It is not enough to simply have shoes which in style and color match
    the rest of your outfit. It is equally important that they are
    properly maintained at all time. This is so first because in that
    way you are going to look your best, and second because the shoes
    will last longer. Polish and bring them to the cobbler every once in
    a while – it is for your own good.
10. Suits are always worn with socks that reach over the calf. That
    should be a rule engraved in stone.
11. Hats are making a comeback in recent years, which is great. There is
    however a certain etiquette to wearing a hat, which dictates they
    are for the outside, or spacious indoor public spaces like an
    airport or a railway station. Don’t be one of those men who never
    take down their hats, even when they are sitting at a table in a
    restaurant.
12. When wearing any kind of clothes, you should make sure that the
    brand labels and signs are not visible while the attire is on you.
    The main idea behind stylish clothing and sense of personal fashion
    is that the items you wear help you complement your own definition
    of yourself. Nowadays it is something we often tend to forget, and
    we let brands define who we are, which is very unfortunate. So, just
    don’t let that happen to you. If you wear a suit or a jacket
    properly, and you feel confident about yourself, it does not matter
    whether it is an Armani or not.

## Warnings

-   Remember, these are only the most basic points on which a sound
    fashion sense is to be built. Once you start applying them, you will
    instinctively find the rest, or your curiosity will lead you to
    them. Just don’t forget that no matter how well you are dressed,
    your attire should match the context of the social situation you are
    in. Learning the proper etiquette is just as important as being a
    good dresser. But groom those instincts, accumulate the necessary
    knowledge and make the effort and you will not regret it, because it
    will change the way you look at the world as a whole.
