You want to be the fashionable girl in the gym? Do you want to be
noticed at the school track? Read this article and you will be the
fashionista while exercising. :)

## Steps

1.  Wear little to no makeup. A tinted moisturizer with SPF--you'll want
    something that's light and won't clog your pores--and a bit of
    coloured lip balm are more than enough. Skip this step if you feel
    it's
    unnecessary.![](Dress_Fashionable_While_Exercising_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Fashionable_While_Exercising_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Keep your hair back and off your face. If your hair is medium or
    long, wear it up in a high ponytail with hair bands that are
    complimentary to hair color. If it's short, keep it back with a hair
    band.![](Dress_Fashionable_While_Exercising_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Fashionable_While_Exercising_Step_2.jpg")
3.  No boxy tee-shirts or oversized sweat pants. Wear layered tank tops
    and fitted shorts/pants. Don't bother to spend a lot of money on
    expensive designer gym clothes (unless you can really afford them)
    because they're going to get ratty fast. Keep them clean and
    smelling
    fresh.![](Dress_Fashionable_While_Exercising_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Fashionable_While_Exercising_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Wear short socks with your
    sneakers.![](Dress_Fashionable_While_Exercising_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Fashionable_While_Exercising_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Keep a cool lookin' water bottle. Hydrate
    often!![](Dress_Fashionable_While_Exercising_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Fashionable_While_Exercising_Step_5.jpg")

## Warnings

-   Wear gym-appropriate undergarments, like sports bras and cotton
    underwear.
-   Make sure you wear deodorant, it's hard to be cool if you're stinky.
-   Always wear SPF!!
-   Don't try too hard, you'll only look silly. For example, you might
    be trying too hard if you wear a hot pink matching track suit, bring
    a small dog along, and float in a billowing cloud of perfume.
