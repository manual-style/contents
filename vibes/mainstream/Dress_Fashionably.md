Sometimes it seems like beauty isn't in the eye of the beholder, doesn't
it? Fashion can seem very elusive and only for the privileged. But it's
easier to start taking strides in the right direction than you think,
towards confidence and a fashionable wardrobe.

## Steps

### Lay the Groundwork

1.  Organize your wardrobe. Get out all your clothes and decide which
    ones you want and don't want. Donate, sell, and a top tip you could
    host your own boot sale, with anything that you haven't worn in a
    year, doesn't fit or isn't your
    style.![](Organize_Your_Wardrobe_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Organize_Your_Wardrobe_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   If you haven't worn it in a year, you won't miss it. Thinking,
        "I could need this one day!" will leave you thinking you have
        nothing to wear for most. Clean it out. Someone else could
        second-love your things.
    -   If you have loads of items that don't fit anymore, don't keep
        them all to be hopeful. Keep a few of your favorites, but pitch
        the rest. A closet full of clothes that don't fit can be very
        de-motivating.
2.  [Know your body type.](Dress_for_Your_Body_Type "wikilink") And
    dress for it. The most fashionable items in the world right now
    won't look good on you if you don't have the right body type for it.
    It does not mean you're too fat, too thin, too tall, or too short.
    You just don't have the optimal shape for that

    -   Dispose of everything that doesn't fit you right. And you'll
        know. If your silhouette isn't quite what it could be, odds are
        you don't wear it.
    -   When you go shopping, keep your body type in mind. For most
        women, it's ideal to draw in at the waist and elongate the leg.
        If you get stuck, you can always ask a sales professional; it's
        their job to help you look good.
3.  Take a good look in the mirror. Try to look at yourself as
    objectively as possible. Pick things about your physical appearance
    that you like and dislike. What do you want to disguise? What do you
    want to emphasize? What's your
    coloring?![](Cut-Hair-Extensions-Step-5.jpg "fig:Cut-Hair-Extensions-Step-5.jpg")
    -   It's important to figure out the answers to these questions
        before you go shopping so you know what to buy! If you haven't a
        clue, shopping for a new wardrobe can be very intimidating.

### Find Your Fashion

1.  Know your style. What do you like? Do you want to incorporate trendy
    items into your wardrobe, or do you prefer a classic look? Do you
    have hipster tendencies? Want to be a professional? Being
    fashionable does not mean adhering to a specific look. It means
    finding what you're comfortable in and running with
    it.![](Keep-up-With-Fashion-Trends-Step-1-Version-3.jpg "fig:Keep-up-With-Fashion-Trends-Step-1-Version-3.jpg")
    -   Spend time flipping through catalogs or surfing websites that
        feature and sell clothes. There are tons of different pieces
        that will look phenomenal on you--it's just a matter of finding
        them.
    -   Find out what other people are wearing. You don't a have to
        necessarily be a fashion clone to be pretty. Maybe you could see
        what 'she's' wearing and transform it into your style.
    -   Ultimately, clothes that you love and feel good in will be worn
        more confidently by you. It has less to do with today's fashion
        and more to do with how you present yourself, though both are
        intertwined.
2.  Consider context. Where you live, where you go and what you do are
    major factors in dressing fashionably. If you wear a ballgown to the
    office, that is not fashionable; if you wear a business suit to the
    prom, likewise. Think about what kind of clothing is appropriate for
    the things you're going to be
    doing.![](Choose-an-Evening-Dress-by-Color-Step-8.jpg "fig:Choose-an-Evening-Dress-by-Color-Step-8.jpg")
    -   Fashion varies area to area. What's popular on a runway in Milan
        may not have made it to the streets of Chicago. Whatever fashion
        you're aiming for, tap into its sources. Finding what you love
        and what looks good on you is imperative, regardless of where
        it's from or who originated it.

### Make It Happen

1.  Start shopping. The best thing to do is to buy long-lasting pieces
    that will retain their class throughout the seasons. Fashion changes
    extremely quickly! Don't fill your wardrobe with things that won't
    be appropriate the same time next year; you'll just regret buying
    it. Every women needs half a dozen items that are staples in her
    wardrobe. Find
    yours.![](Keep-up-With-Fashion-Trends-Step-12.jpg "fig:Keep-up-With-Fashion-Trends-Step-12.jpg")
    -   In the context of what flatters your body, find a handful of
        your favorite, variable pieces. A classic white button-down, a
        favorite pair of flatteringly-cut jeans, boots, cinched-waist
        skirt and a sweater, for starters. You can mix and match these
        items all you want for dozens of different looks.
2.  Shop more. Now that you've got the basics, it's time to have fun!
    Buy some great shoes, cute accessories and get a haircut! Bright
    purple leather trench looks too tacky? A handbag in the same style
    will be
    fantastic.![](Keep-up-With-Fashion-Trends-Step-6.jpg "fig:Keep-up-With-Fashion-Trends-Step-6.jpg")
    -   After all, the devil's in the details. Accessories and
        hairstyles are the parts that show your sassy side the easiest.
        So cut out that celeb 'do from that magazine and head on over to
        the salon. Might as well get your nails done while you're at it.
    -   Note the ol' adage, "Put on your accessories, then take off one
        before leaving." And it rings true: accessories are great--but a
        necklace, bracelet, earrings, rings, watch, sunglasses, and hat
        are a bit much. Pair a couple of accessories with each outfit;
        don't go overboard.
3.  Ask someone else to go shopping with you. It's always good to have
    an outsider's perspective, especially a friend to make the time pass
    by more quickly. Bring along someone who can give you
    well-formulated critiques regarding your clothes. The image we see
    in the mirror isn't always how we really
    look!![](Try-on-a-Bikini-Step-7.jpg "fig:Try-on-a-Bikini-Step-7.jpg")
    -   Take everyone's perspective with a grain of salt. Her style is
        her style, not yours. But if she absolutely adores something on
        you and you don't see it, take a moment to look. Wait a minute
        to see if you can find what she sees. Your mind may open up to a
        brand new style.

## Tips

-   Confidence is key. If you don't have confidence, nobody will admire
    your look. You have to believe in yourself, then everybody else will
    too.
-   Be you! If you like something but someone else doesn't, don't fret.
    They have no right to say what you can and can't like. Remember your
    honest friend, though. There's a difference between something that
    fits you horribly and something that's just a difference in style.
-   Try places like bargain stores and emporiums for jewelry; they have
    great stuff for great prices!
-   Flick through magazines and find a style icon you can be inspired
    by. Stars need to always look good as they are constantly followed!
-   To stay on the top of the fashion trends, you can consult with a
    fashion stylist. If fashion is your passion, you can work at
    [becoming a stylist](Become_a_Stylist "wikilink") yourself!
-   Remember you can always make old things new. If you have sweet
    sewing skills, put them into place! Never be afraid to stand out by
    being unique. Setting trends is always fashionable.
-   Wear dark colors in winter, and bright and trendy clothes in summer.
-   Don't be afraid to show who you really are!
-   Mint is a color that matches with anything, be it tan, pink, blue,
    white, or any other color!
-   If you have something patterned on, make sure that you have at least
    one base colored accessory(s).
-   Don't wear outfits that have designs that are too busy or aren't
    what you like to wear, even if someone says it's trendy.

## Warnings

-   Don't <b>ever</b> wear something that doesn't make you feel
    beautiful. If you feel uncomfortable, everyone can see that. Being
    fashionable is being confident.
-   Do **not** try to coordinate your makeup to your outfit. It sounds
    like a good idea, but it's not. EX: pink shirt, pink makeup.
    Instead, try choosing makeup which compliments your eye color.
-   Clothes do not look cooler the more you show your skin. It's fine to
    show some skin, but clothes do not have to have plunging v-neck
    necklines or be midriff bearing to be attractive. Leave something to
    the imagination.
