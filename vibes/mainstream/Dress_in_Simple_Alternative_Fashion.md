If you love the idea of dressing in a simple alternative style, the
first thing you need to do is decide what that term means to you.
Wearing simple, alternative clothes can be fun and is good ways to
express yourself. Some styles are complex and you might not feel they
are for you. How you dress might be restricted by school or work
policies, your parents, time limits and budget - a simple alternative
look is very adaptable. This article will help you simplify down the
alternative look, get started at step number one below.

## Steps

1.  Picture your ideal simple alternative look. You don't need to wear
    labels. Make sure you have a pretty good idea of what you want to
    wear to live your life. Print out pictures from the Internet and cut
    out images from magazines of styles you like to keep you inspired.
    Paste them to your wall, or create a little fashion notebook and put
    them in
    there.![](Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Go through your closet. A lot of times you can still use a lot of
    your current clothes in your new wardrobe. Get rid of anything that
    you don't feel flatters your figure, that you dislike, or that you
    find uncomfortable or that doesn't fit with your simple alternative
    loom. Keep an eye out for things that could be altered to fit your
    new style, as sometimes they could end up being your favorite
    pieces.![](Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Know what to look for. Make sure you have outfits for all seasons
    and the sorts of occasions and events you attend. Arguably an
    alternative style includes long-sleeved, plaid flannel shirts,
    T-shirts of classic bands, black tights, dark or acid wash jeans or
    shorts, vintage button-down shirts and cardigans. For shoes, you can
    opt for Converse, classic boots, combat boots or any other footwear
    you like. Keep an eye out for studded clothing and accessories, and
    make sure to pick up a few dressy outfits that fit your simple
    alternative
    style.![](Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Begin shopping for your new wardrobe if you want to. Check out
    high-street and mainstream stores such as Kohl's, Gap, JC Penny, and
    even Macy's to see if you can find anything that catches your eye.
    Make sure to always get the basics, and buy them good-quality so you
    don't have to keep buying them again. Next, try some stores that are
    more in your style. Hot Topic has some good band tees and
    accessories, but be warned: many alternative people shop there, so
    you most likely won't be "one-of-a-kind" unless it is very unpopular
    in your area. Zumiez, Journey's, and even Claire's all are good
    places to
    shop.![](Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Shop at thrift stores for old-fashioned, vintage, or cheaper
        clothing. Don't be afraid to shop in unusual places or places
        that don't look like they'd have any potential; it's easy to
        miss a needle in a haystack.
5.  Don't forget to try shopping online! There are a lot of great
    websites that sell alternative accessories and clothing for fairly
    low prices, such as bluebanana.com, shanalogic.com, restyle.pl/, and
    shopplasticland.com. Be careful when shopping online; since you
    can't try on clothes, you have to pay extra special attention to the
    sizing charts and what the material it is made of. One brand's size
    large may be a medium in another
    brand.![](Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Try altering you clothes. Cut up your tees, rip up your jeans, and
    add embellishments. If you can sew, try attaching buttons and
    different fabrics to really customize your old clothes and make them
    look brand
    new!![](Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
7.  Find different ways to style your hair. You can have short and
    punkish hair, long and flowing hair, cute and wavy hair; whatever
    you want. Learn how to dye your hair, or go to a friend or
    hairdresser, and maybe dye your hair different colors. You can make
    it all black, two-toned, rainbow; whatever floats your boat. Curl
    it, crimp it, iron it, scrunch it, braid it; do whatever you think
    looks
    best.![](Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Start trying on different outfits. Don't be afraid to wear something
    you would think would never match; it may look really good. Have a
    friend who wears similar styles help you decide whether they look
    good or not. Some good examples would
    include:![](Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
    -   a ripped up tee, skinny jeans, any shoes
    -   a long-sleeve shirt, skirt, Doc Martens
    -   a simple tee, long skirt, "goth boots"
    -   plain tee, ripped up jeans, any shoes
    -   alternative dress, Doc Martens (depending on the style of the
        dress)
    -   tee with a vest, shorts, any shoes
    -   layers upon layers of different clothing
9.  Be proud of your style. Don't let anyone put you down no matter what
    they say. It's your life and you should be able to do what you
    want.![](Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_in_Simple_Alternative_Fashion_Step_9.jpg")
10. Finish off the look with hair and makeup. While there is no typical
    alternative hairstyle, many people opt for thick, sweeping bangs
    over one eye, or a high ponytail with studded hair accessories.
    Alternative makeup is generally kept pretty simple and natural, with
    the exception of heavy eyeliner, smoky or cat eyes, and red
    lipstick. Still, these elements of your style are highly variable,
    so go with whatever you like
