Everyone wants to be pretty and everyone wants to be fashionable. This
article will help all those girls who are not quite satisfied with their
clothes! Just follow these simple steps and you will become a fashion
goddess!

## Steps

1.  Clean your skin. If you have acne, use the treatment you have been
    given or if you don't just use a general scrub or cream wash to even
    out your skin. Don't forget to moisturize your skin, even if you
    don't have dry
    skin.![](Look_Fashionable_and_Pretty_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Fashionable_and_Pretty_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Makeup. When you are applying mascara do not put too much on your
    brush as it will go blotchy! For daily makeup put on some brown or
    creamy eyeshadow, black eyeliner,mascara and to finish off some rosy
    pink blush and lip
    gloss!![](Look_Fashionable_and_Pretty_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Fashionable_and_Pretty_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Keep your nails looking nice. File them straight away if they get
    nicked, buff them. Do not bite or pick them. You don't have to paint
    your nails and in fact, some people prefer natural
    nails.![](Look_Fashionable_and_Pretty_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Fashionable_and_Pretty_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Dress to impress. Make sure you are always comfortable with what
    have on. Never go out of your comfort
    zone.![](Look_Fashionable_and_Pretty_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Fashionable_and_Pretty_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Believe that you are beautiful. Nobody else will think so if you
    don't.![](Look_Fashionable_and_Pretty_Step_5.jpg "fig:Look_Fashionable_and_Pretty_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Make sure you have a range of outfits so that you are not wearing
    the same thing every
    day!![](Look_Fashionable_and_Pretty_Step_6.jpg "fig:Look_Fashionable_and_Pretty_Step_6.jpg")
