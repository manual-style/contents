Have you ever wondered how to 'stand out' in your school uniform? Ever
felt like you're one of the members of an army of clones, while looking
the same as everybody else around you?

## Steps

1.  First of all, all you need to do is get dressed in your gym uniform.
    One way to look different in gym is by having a cute hairstyle.
    During gym your hair might get in the way, so use a hair tie to tie
    it back into a 'pony tail' , braid, 'messy bun'( there are many
    tutorials scattered all over the internet teaching you the perfect
    way of making a messy bun), or any other way to keep it back. You
    can use a unique headband to secure the hair. Adding some colorful
    clips to make sure you're hair stays in place can be
    cute.![](Look_Fashionable_in_P.E_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Fashionable_in_P.E_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  \]Next thing you want to do is put on deodorant so you don't stink
    up the place. Next is makeup. You probably shouldn't wear
    foundation, because it will jut look gross when you sweat. If you
    have acne or some pimples you feel like you need to cover up, put on
    some concealer, but know it may come off. If you want eyeshadow, try
    a neutral color or it might seem a little too much just for gym. If
    you're wearing mascara or eyeliner try to use waterproof because one
    again, of sweat. I know. Gross. If you want blush, use cream blush
    duh as Maybelline's bouncy blush. You probably shouldn't need any
    though, because exercising will give you pink cheeks. Last thing you
    need is lip balm. Chapped lips are the worst!!! Make your makeup
    look natural, unlike this awful picture someone hose that I dunno
    how to delete lol If your gym shirt is really baggy, use a hair tie
    to tie it at the back and flip the tied fabric underneath the shirt,
    this will make it look tighter. If you're allowed to, cut off the
    sleeves of your shirt or decorate it how you would
    like.![](Look_Fashionable_in_P.E_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Fashionable_in_P.E_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  the last thing is cute gym shoes. Converse, vans, or any shoes your
    taste are good. Try to keep them looking clean, so they always look
    new. A fun way to change it every once in a while is by using
    different laces
    sometimes.![](Look_Fashionable_in_P.E_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Fashionable_in_P.E_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
