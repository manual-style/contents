Being glamorous. Being fashionably chic. It's more than a brand and more
than a name. Being like Audrey Hepburn, or whoever you consider a chic
style icon, doesn't mean you need to buy all new clothes and restructure
your wardrobe. It's an attitude you can develop that will influence your
look. It's an idea.

## Steps

1.  Go shopping in thrift stores and boutiques to acquire recommended
    clothing and
    jewelry.![](Go_shopping_Step_1.jpg "fig:Go_shopping_Step_1.jpg")
    -   little black dresses are a must have. They look good on anybody.
    -   kitten heels with rounded toes or other classical looking
        everyday shoes always work.
    -   Always purchase clothes that fit you - no matter what size the
        tag reads.
