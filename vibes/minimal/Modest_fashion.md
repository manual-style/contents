![](Orthodox_pilgrim.jpg "fig:Orthodox_pilgrim.jpg") is seen wearing a
dress and a [Christian
headcovering](Christian_headcovering "wikilink").\]\] The term **modest
fashion** or **modest dressing** refers to a
[fashion](fashion "wikilink") trend in women of wearing less
skin-revealing clothes, especially in a way that satisfies their
spiritual and stylistic requirements for reasons of faith, religion or
personal preference[1]. The exact interpretation of
['modest'](Modesty "wikilink") varies across cultures and countries.
There is no unambiguous interpretation as it is influenced by
socio-cultural characteristics of each country. Beyond the various
interpretations, all agree on the idea that modest fashion means loose
clothing, comfortable dressing and covering of the body according to
person's own comfort.

The term "modest" may have varied interpretations across religious
boundaries and even within them. Commonalities can also exist; for
example, many Christian, Jewish, and Muslim women practice the veiling
of their head, with Christian women wearing a
[headcovering](Christian_headcovering "wikilink"), Jewish women wearing
a [tichel](tichel "wikilink"), and Muslim women wearing a
[hijab](hijab "wikilink").[2][3][4]

“There’s a general misconception that modest clothing is inherently
oppressive,” said Michelle Honig, an Orthodox Jewish fashion journalist
and the keynote speaker during fashion month at [New York
University](New_York_University "wikilink") for the Meeting Through
Modesty fashion symposium. “But if women in so-called ‘liberated
countries’ still choose to cover their bodies, then they have made a
choice. They have agency."[5]

Modest fashion across religions expresses consensus that it should not
be experienced as a limiting factor in style. Brands are churning out
designs and collections that an orthodox Muslim, Jew, Christian,
[Hindu](Hindu "wikilink") can wear in style. [Dolce &
Gabbana](Dolce_&_Gabbana "wikilink"), [H&M](H&M "wikilink"), and
[Uniqlo](Uniqlo "wikilink") are just a few names that have entered the
modest fashion segment, making clothes that cover most parts of the body
while allowing women to experiment with the latest trends.

In late 2018, modest fashion was considered a 250 billion dollar
industry[6]

This growing phenomenon has been studied by scholars such as British
professor Reina Lewis from [London College of
Fashion](London_College_of_Fashion "wikilink"). Among her works on the
topic we can mention 'Modest Fashion: Styling Bodies, Mediating Faith'
(2013) and 'Muslim Fashion: Contemporary Style Cultures' (2015).[7][8]
