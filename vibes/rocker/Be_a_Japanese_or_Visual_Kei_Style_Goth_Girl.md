If you've been listening to Visual Kei lately and want to have a look
similar to a band member of that genre, this is the page for you!

## Steps

1.  Look at some Visual Kei themed magazines or websites to get
    inspiration for your own take on the style. Some good magazines to
    buy are Shoxx, Cure, Kera, or the Gothic-Lolita Bible. You can find
    many of these in places such as Barnes & Noble, Hot Topic, Walden
    Books, etc. Cure features a special "Style Council" section with
    step-by-step makeup/hair
    tutorials.![](Be_a_Japanese_or_Visual_Kei_Style_Goth_Girl_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_a_Japanese_or_Visual_Kei_Style_Goth_Girl_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Wear eyeliner -- it can be very important to pull of the Visual Kei
    style, but it's not mandatory. Eyeliner is usually worn heavily on
    the top lid, and it stops halfway along the bottom
    lid.![](Be_a_Japanese_or_Visual_Kei_Style_Goth_Girl_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Japanese_or_Visual_Kei_Style_Goth_Girl_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Make your bangs long (below eyebrow) and try to cut it unnaturally
    straight. You can also have your bangs choppily cut, or pointed in
    the middle. Dying your hair different colors is definitely
    encouraged. Waka from Danger Gang is a good reference because she
    has a varied style and her look is worth trying to
    emulate.![](Be_a_Japanese_or_Visual_Kei_Style_Goth_Girl_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Japanese_or_Visual_Kei_Style_Goth_Girl_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Wear proper attire. The typical American "goth" styles will not do
    if you're really serious about this. Try to mix punk and goth
    fashion into one. Visual Kei is a very "crowded" and "full" style,
    so all kinds of fashions are incorporated. Visual Kei style usually
    has a variety of color. So wear colors! Don't just content yourself
    with black. Some popular patterns for visual kei are animal print or
    floral.![](Be_a_Japanese_or_Visual_Kei_Style_Goth_Girl_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_a_Japanese_or_Visual_Kei_Style_Goth_Girl_Step_4.jpg")
5.  There are many subsets of Visual Kei fashion. Angura Kei, Oshare
    Kei, Punk/Goth hybrid fashions, etc. Experiment with all types and
    see what suits you best. Or you can have a varied style,
    incorporating all these subsets into your daily
    fashion.![](Be_a_Japanese_or_Visual_Kei_Style_Goth_Girl_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_a_Japanese_or_Visual_Kei_Style_Goth_Girl_Step_5.jpg")
    -   Remember that you do not have to spend all your money on clothes
        from Japan. There are plenty of things you can find on your own
        here that go great with the Visual Kei aesthetic. Second-hand
        shops are great to find varied clothes to mix and match.

## Tips

-   You should be acquainted with a couple Visual Kei bands/artists such
    as Girugamesh, Malice Mizer, Lareine, D'espairs Ray, alice nine.,
    the GazettE, Nightmare, Vidoll, Phantasmagoria, Moi dix Mois, X
    Japan, Miyavi, Hizaki Grace Project, Kagrra, Kra, Versailles, Danger
    Gang, An Cafe, Dir en Grey, The Candy Spooky Theatre, etc.
-   Keep your own style, don't just copy someone from a band or that
    would make you a "COSPLAYER". It's fine to cosplay, but do not just
    dress like them all the time and say you have an individual style.
-   Visual Kei is just a form of expression, so please be yourself while
    being mindful of others.

    messy or sloppy-looking.
