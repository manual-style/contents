It's getting common to be of the "Lovelocker" style. You show your real
self, but there's often one general style, though everyone is different.

## Steps

### Make up

1.  ![Image:MAC_pink_lipstick_(1).jpg](MAC_pink_lipstick_(1).jpg "fig:Image:MAC_pink_lipstick_(1).jpg")Make
    up. Paler people should wear a hot pink or neon pink lipstick,
    whereas darker people should wear a hot pink or a dark pink
    lipstick. But avoid light pinks, such as pastel pink or baby pink.
2.  Try to keep your skin quite plain. Try to cover up freckles and
    discolouration. Use a foundation or concealer.
3.  ![Image:Green and Blue M.A.C Eyeshadow

    Use a dark pink, black or purple eyeliner and use a pink, green or
    blue eyeshadow on the bottom half of your eyelid, then use a light
    or flesh coloured eyeshadow on the top half. Blend them slightly.
4.  Picture the shape of a face, then divide it into four parts
    vertically. On the outermost parts you can do some little hearts or
    something, but be sure not to make them go to the middle of the
    face.

    Hair. Don't bleach your hair. Keep it natural, but try to have it
    nice and long, but short hair can look really nice, too. Choose
    whichever style you wish. Just don't get it too tangly.
