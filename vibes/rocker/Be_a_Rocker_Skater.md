This is a guide to both male and female readers on how to completely
rock out and learn to skate.

## Steps

1.  [Be yourself](Be_Yourself "wikilink"). Don\`t try to fit in just to
    impress people. If you don\`t like rock music or skateboarding then
    don\`t force yourself to, just embrace what it is that you do like
    to
    do.![](Be_a_Rocker_Skater_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_a_Rocker_Skater_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Learn to [play an
    instrument](Learn_to_Play_an_Instrument "wikilink"). Get lessons and
    practice before you tell anyone that you can play. Try for a month,
    at least, to play the instrument before you tell anyone. You don\`t
    want them to think you're lying and end up calling you a
    poser.![](Be_a_Rocker_Skater_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Rocker_Skater_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Learn how to skate. Go out and purchase a complete skate setup and
    start learning as soon as possible! The best way to learn is to just
    go outside and DO IT. You will not accomplish anything if you sit
    inside and continue to be afraid of the asphalt. Be prepared, you
    WILL get injured (no exceptions). If you do, the best thing to do is
    to get back on the
    board.![](Be_a_Rocker_Skater_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Rocker_Skater_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Get the right look. Which is really anything related to yourself and
    your interests. You like the color black? Go for it. You like the
    Stones? Get an authentic tee. Getting a band t-shirt from the
    nearest department store does not cut it. Getting a band t-shirt
    from a show they played in is the best and most fun way to collect
    shirts.![](Be_a_Rocker_Skater_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_a_Rocker_Skater_Step_4.jpg")
5.  A band is optional, but not a bad idea! Once you get your skills up
    on your instrument, a band will make you more of a rocker more than
    any of these previous steps as long as your band rocks. Listen to
    some good rock bands and find what you like. Read their lyrics.
    Inspiration is what you need here. Once you get that inspiration,
    get a few of your friends together who play different instruments.
    Make sure they rock too, or else the band genre will change
    constantly and, chances are, it might not turn out rock, and you'll
    have to leave. If you have no friends that rock, you can always go
    solo. You'll have to learn the basics of the other instruments, but
    you can do it! There is a classified section on Myspace, and there's
    a section saved for musicians. You can put an ad in for a band in
    your area, and this will solve your band
    problem.![](Be_a_Rocker_Skater_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_a_Rocker_Skater_Step_5.jpg")

## Tips

-   You must really love what you do. You don't do it just to impress
    people.
-   Do not tell anyone that you can play or ride before you can actually
    do it. It takes a lot of practice.
-   Make sure you know about the brand you're wearing/riding.

## Warnings

-   Don't buy a rip-stick as its not proper skating, you'll most likely
    be called a poser if you call yourself a skater and ride a
    rip-stick.

Don't Be A Poser!!...

-   Don\`t be a poser, be yourself.
-   If you don't like to [skateboard](Skateboard "wikilink") or you just
    can't do you, trade the board for the blades, you're still skating.
