Makeup is a wonderful tool for women. It accents and brings out their
beauty, as well as showing their personal style. However, have you ever
wanted to shake your makeup routine for fun? This article will teach you
to change your everyday look to rock.

## Steps

1.  Apply the basic parts of your makeup. First, apply your primer. This
    will ensure that your makeup lasts for as long as possible. Once you
    have completed the first step, apply a concealer to hide blemishes
    and flaws. Also, use a liquid foundation to serve as the base of
    your makeup. Be sure that it matches your skin tone. Once you have
    applied it, set it with your favorite setting powder.
    -   Note that if you use the BB Cream, you can use a pressed powder.
2.  Focus on your eyes. Prime your eyes in order to help the makeup last
    longer than usual. Afterwards, apply a light shade of eye shadow in
    the innermost part of your eye. Then, apply another shade that is
    slightly darker. Use an eyeliner to outline your eyes before
    applying mascara.
    -   For a dramatic look, use false eyelashes.
3.  Contour and highlight your face. The key for a perfect contoured
    face is found in three steps:
    -   First, apply the bronzer in between the jawbone and cheekbones,
        as well as the side of the nose and your temples.
    -   Second, apply a blush to the apples of your cheeks
    -   Lastly, highlight your T-Zone (forehead, bridge of the nose,
        from upper part of the cheeks to under your eyes and chin).
        Blend them well with a kabuki brush or a different one of your
        choice.
4.  Focus on your lips. For the appearance of full lips, use aÂ dark
    shade of lip liner (burgundy) to line your lips. Next, apply a
    lighter shade of lipstick to your lips (ruby red). Swipe your mouth
    with lip gloss if desired.

## Tips

-   Use colors that complement your skin tone. Be sure that they match
    each other.

## Warnings

-   Avoid applying too much makeup. Remember that less is more.
