if you seriously don't care about what people think when they see you.
And you love metal or any type of rock, this article might be for you.

## Steps

1.  Go to sleep late and wake up late, every day. That shows that you
    don't really have time to get ready in the mornings. For example, if
    school starts at 8:00 wake up at 7:45 or something, but if you don't
    like waking up late... wake up early and you can watch TV or
    something, maybe have some
    breakfast.![](Get_the_Metal_Rocker_Chick_"I_Just_Woke_up_and_I_Don't_Care"_Look_Step_1.jpg "fig:Get_the_Metal_Rocker_Chick_"I_Just_Woke_up_and_I_Don't_Care"_Look_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Wear wrinkled jeans, that can let people know that they were
    probably the first pair of pants you saw and you didn't have time to
    go get clean ones or something(but don't always wear the same pair
    of jeans, its kinda gross, coming from a chick.) you can also wear
    sweats maybe over-sized jeans, wearing your pajamas might turn some
    heads.![](Get_the_Metal_Rocker_Chick_"I_Just_Woke_up_and_I_Don't_Care"_Look_Step_2.jpg "fig:Get_the_Metal_Rocker_Chick_"I_Just_Woke_up_and_I_Don't_Care"_Look_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Wear any top you want, it can be a spaghetti strap or maybe an
    over-sized Judas Priest t-shirt, probably the same shirt you wore to
    bed.

4.  Wear slip-on shoes almost every day, for example (slippers, or maybe
    regular tennis shoes with the laces tucked inside)

5.  Listen to your music always, you'd probably fall asleep during class
    but that's
    okay.![](Get_the_Metal_Rocker_Chick_"I_Just_Woke_up_and_I_Don't_Care"_Look_Step_5.jpg "fig:Get_the_Metal_Rocker_Chick_"I_Just_Woke_up_and_I_Don't_Care"_Look_Step_5.jpg")
