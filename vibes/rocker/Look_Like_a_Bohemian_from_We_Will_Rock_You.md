If you're anything like me, you've seen We Will Rock You and absolutely
the look of the Bohemians. So, as the title suggests, this is how to
look like a Bohemian.

## Steps

1.  Get yourself a band t-shirt. Choose your favorite band, preferably
    from the 70's or 80's. Obviously, a good idea is a Queen t-shirt.
    However, I have a vintage-looking slouchy tank with a quote from
    Freddie Mercury. Be open-minded! Don't just look in high street
    stores, try charity shops
    etc.![](Look_Like_a_Bohemian_from_We_Will_Rock_You_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Bohemian_from_We_Will_Rock_You_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Leather jackets look very rock and roll. If you don't like wearing
    real leather then get a faux leather jacket
    instead.![](Look_Like_a_Bohemian_from_We_Will_Rock_You_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Bohemian_from_We_Will_Rock_You_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Look for anything and everything studded or ripped. If you take
    pictures of Bohemians and you'll see they wear a LOT of ripped
    clothing. This could be anything to ripped jeans to a ripped mini
    skirt. Anything instantly looks better
    ripped.![](Look_Like_a_Bohemian_from_We_Will_Rock_You_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Bohemian_from_We_Will_Rock_You_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Fingerless gloves. Scaramouche and Meat both wear them. You may have
    to track them down if you want leather ones, but Claire's sell some
    nice fabric
    ones.![](Look_Like_a_Bohemian_from_We_Will_Rock_You_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Bohemian_from_We_Will_Rock_You_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Dramatic make up is important. If you're aloud to wear make up, go
    to town with it! Lots of eyeliner, bright lipstick. Anything will
    do!![](Look_Like_a_Bohemian_from_We_Will_Rock_You_Step_5.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Bohemian_from_We_Will_Rock_You_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Hair, hair, hair. If you watch backstage videos, you see how
    important the wigs and hair are in WWRY. Anything can look bohemian!
    The messier, the better! If you are allowed to dye your hair, try
    something
    drastic.![](Look_Like_a_Bohemian_from_We_Will_Rock_You_Step_6.jpg "fig:Look_Like_a_Bohemian_from_We_Will_Rock_You_Step_6.jpg")

## Tips

-   Make the process gradual. An overnight change may make you look like
    a poser.
-   Don't try to hard to stand out. Just let it come naturally.

## Warnings

-   Take it from a 21st century bohemian. This isn't all bluebirds and
    rainbows, some people won't be happy! Try to develop a thick skin
    before this.
