This is a great article for you who wants to look like a Japanese
rocker, commonly referred to as J-rocker or Visual Kei. Enjoy.

## Steps

1.  Know the music! The music is part of the foundation of this! There
    is not much point in trying to look like a j-rocker without
    listening to the bands and artists. There are very many
    \[bands/artists\], and even though they're all called Visual
    Kei/J-rockers most of them are very different from each other. Some
    popular performers with different sounds are are X Japan, the
    GazettE, Dir en Grey, Mejibray, BUCK-TICK, An Cafe (although they
    are also often referred to as Oshare Kei, a brighter and "happier"
    style of v-kei), Alice Nine, Versailles, PaRADEiS, SuG, LM.C, Gackt,
    Miyavi, DecoLa Hopping, Screw, Girug√§mesh, and many, many
    more.![](Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_1.jpg")
2.  You don't have to like them all of course, since they are so
    different. Try finding a little bunch of favorites and let yourself
    be inspired by their songs and style. (Tip: Visit
    shattered-tranquility.net for the latest news on Japanese rock, and
    maybe discover new
    artists.)![](Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Get the right hairstyle. There are really no rules for this, just
    try to get a hairstyle that is unique, suits you and, of course,
    that you feel comfortable in. Bold colours, spikes, and sectioned
    hair is rather often used by people that want to look like a
    j-rocker, but there are many artists that have their natural hair
    colour and a very "normal" haircut and have very mainstream
    clothing, focusing on music instead of
    style.![](Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_3.jpg")
4.  We won't continue on them though, since this is about sticking out
    with looks and not
    music.![](Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Try bringing a photo of your idol to your hairdresser. Just keep in
    mind that some hairstyles are not appropriate for some hair types,
    and some haircuts demand a lot of
    styling.![](Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_5.jpg "fig:Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_5.jpg")
6.  If you don't want to get a big, permanent change(maybe you are not
    sure you want to be j-rockish for a long time), buy coloured
    hairspray and lots of hair accessories like bows, small hats etc. Or
    just don't change your hair, if that's what you feel like. The
    j-rock style is, after all, about being unique, so you might look
    unique with you natural hairstyle/colour among other
    j-rockers.![](Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_6.jpg "fig:Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Wearing make up is optional, but if you do so, do it right. Just as
    with the hair, make it unique, stylish and get inspired by your
    idols.![](Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_7.jpg "fig:Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_7.jpg")
8.  A tip is to just take your regular makeup/natural face and add a
    small details; a little glitter, coloured eyeliner, a slight cat
    eye, stickers
    etc.![](Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_8.jpg "fig:Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Find the right clothes and accessories! The clothes can be hard to
    get, but if you are creative, you can make your grandmothers ugliest
    dress look like a valuable collectible from a concert. Use
    accessories if you think that your outfit isn't special enough. Once
    again, get inspired by other j-rockers and add a personal touch to
    it.![](Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_9.jpg "fig:Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_9.jpg")
10. Learn some Japanese. Not that important, but really impressive, and
    also fun because this way you can understand the lyrics of your
    favorite songs better and maybe also make your own
    songs.![](Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_10.jpg "fig:Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_10.jpg")
11. Get a fan item, such as a band t-shirt, posters etc. This is also an
    option, but shows
    originality.![](Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_11.jpg "fig:Look_Visual_Kei_Jrock_Step_11.jpg")

## Tips

-   Don't mind people who make fun of you! Raise your head up high!
    You're unique and special!
-   Please don't be a poser and go around looking like this without a
    lick of knowledge on the music, but don't be a besser wisser and
    look down on people that isn't as much v-kei as you either.
-   It's all about being unique!
-   Be inspired by your favorite artists. Google images and try out the
    looks.
-   Get a signature item or look, like Reita's(the GazettE) noseband.
    This is a great tip, and also good if you don't want to put all of
    your energy on styling at morning, but it still looks very original.

## Warnings

-   This is all about being unique, and even though you are recommended
    to get inspired by your idols, don't copy them all the way. A true
    j-rocker does not look like anybody else. (Except if you're
    cosplaying and twinning.)
-   Use heat protector on your hair before you straighten/curl your
    hair, if you do so. Also, dying your hair too much and using a lot
    of products in it causes damage to the hair, keep that in mind.
-   Your finished look will probably get much attention, but don't mind
    it.
