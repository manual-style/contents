**Post-grunge** is a [rock music](/rock_music "wikilink") subgenre that
emerged in the 1990s. Originally, the term was used almost pejoratively
to label bands such as [Bush](/Bush_(British_band) "wikilink"),
[Candlebox](/Candlebox "wikilink") and [Collective
Soul](/Collective_Soul "wikilink") that emulated the original sound of
[grunge](/grunge "wikilink").

In the late 1990s, post-grunge morphed into a more clearly defined style
that married the sound and [aesthetic](/Aesthetics_of_music "wikilink")
of grunge with a less intense and abrasive tone, rising to prominence
that lasted in the 2000s. Bands such as ,
[Live](/Live_(band) "wikilink"), Bush, [Puddle of
Mudd](/Puddle_of_Mudd "wikilink"), [Staind](/Staind "wikilink"),
[Nickelback](/Nickelback "wikilink"),
[Default](/Default_(band) "wikilink"), [Creed](/Creed_(band) "wikilink")
and [Matchbox Twenty](/Matchbox_Twenty "wikilink") all achieved
mainstream success.

## Characteristics

During the 1990s, a post-grunge sound emerged which emulated the
attitudes and music of grunge, particularly its thick,
[distorted](/Distortion_(music) "wikilink")
[guitars](/guitar "wikilink"), but with a less intense and less abrasive
tone.[1][2] Unlike a lot of early grunge bands, post-grunge bands often
worked through [major record labels](/major_record_label "wikilink") and
incorporated influences from a variety of musical genres including:
[jangle pop](/jangle_pop "wikilink"), , [ska
revival](/ska_revival "wikilink"), [alternative
metal](/alternative_metal "wikilink") and [classic
rock](/classic_rock "wikilink").[3] Post-grunge music tends to be in
mid-tempo and is noted for having "a polished, radio-ready
production".[4] Grierson of About.com wrote that musically, post-grunge
bands "split the difference between plaintive ballads and aggressive
rockers, resulting in songs that combine the two extremes into a
sad-eyed, propulsive middle ground".[5] Post-grunge tends to feature the
"...same kind of melody as...[bubblegum pop](/bubblegum_pop "wikilink")"
and pop song structures.[6][7] Sometimes music features both an electric
guitar and an acoustic guitar playing simultaneously.[8] Post-grunge
tends to have production quality that is much higher and cleaner than
grunge.[9]

[thumb\|left\|Post-grunge band [Nickelback](Nickelback "wikilink") in
2008](/File:Nickelbackwembleyarena.jpg "wikilink") A "major rift"
between grunge and is in the lyrical substance of the music; grunge
expressed emotion through loose metaphors or third-person narratives,
while post-grunge was known for being direct and blunt.[10] While
describing lyrics that are common in , Sasha Geffen of *Consequence of
Sound* wrote that "plunged directly into the Geffen wrote that most
post-grunge songs that achieved mainstream success "call after a
prospective or past companion in the first person".[11] Post-grunge
lyrics also tend to be about topics such as relationships, romance and
drug addiction.[12][13] According to Geffen, "grunge's frontmen posed
with their addictions; songwriters sought redemption for them".[14]
Geffen states that post-grunge songs "fit the mold of songs made
for...teenage and pre-teen girls" who were "longing for a distant
someone", and the songs "wore signs of femininity" which she posits may
be why the "...post-grunge moment pissed off so many angry dudes."[15]
According to Geffen, artists such as [Alanis
Morissette](/Alanis_Morissette "wikilink"), [No
Doubt](/No_Doubt "wikilink") and [Sarah
McLachlan](/Sarah_McLachlan "wikilink") all "crystallized the
songwriting strategy that would form the emotional core of the
post-grunge moment".[16]

## As a pejorative label

[thumb\|right\|200px\|British band Bush (*pictured*) were described by
Matt Diehl of *[Rolling Stone](Rolling_Stone "wikilink")* as "the most
successful and shameless mimics of Nirvana's
music".[17]](/File:Bush_grsATX.jpg "wikilink")

Originally, post-grunge was a label that was meant to be almost
pejorative, suggesting that grunge bands labelled as were simply
musically derivative, or a cynical response to an
"[authentic](/Authenticity_(philosophy) "wikilink")" rock movement.[18]
When grunge became a mainstream genre because of bands such as
[Nirvana](/Nirvana_(band) "wikilink") and [Pearl
Jam](/Pearl_Jam "wikilink"), record labels started signing bands that
sounded similar to these bands' sonic identities. Bands labeled as that
emerged when grunge was mainstream such as
[Bush](/Bush_(band) "wikilink"), [Candlebox](/Candlebox "wikilink") and
[Collective Soul](/Collective_Soul "wikilink") are all noted for
emulating the sound of bands that launched grunge into the
mainstream.[19] According to Tim Grierson of
[About.com](/About.com "wikilink"), the almost pejorative use of the
"post-grunge" label to describe these bands was "suggesting that rather
than being a musical movement in their own right, they were just a
calculated, cynical response to a legitimate stylistic shift in [rock
music](/rock_music "wikilink")".[20] During the late 1990s, post-grunge
morphed, becoming a derivative of grunge that combined characteristics
of grunge with a more commercially accessible tone. During this time,
post-grunge bands such as [Creed](/Creed_(band) "wikilink") and
[Nickelback](/Nickelback "wikilink") emerged. Grierson wrote: Grierson
also wrote, "Post-grunge was a profitable musical style, but bands like
Nirvana and Pearl Jam were beloved partly because of their perceived
integrity in avoiding the mainstream. Post-grunge, by comparison, seemed
to exist in order to court that very audience."[21]

## History

### Earlyâ€“mid-1990s

[thumb\|right\|200px\|Candlebox in
2008](/File:Candlebox-promo-seattle2-1.jpg "wikilink") Even at the
height of their popularity, after the release of
*[Nevermind](/Nevermind "wikilink")* (1991) brought grunge to
international attention, Nirvana experienced increasing problems, partly
caused by [Kurt Cobain](/Kurt_Cobain "wikilink")'s [drug
addiction](/drug_addiction "wikilink") and growing dissatisfaction with
commercial success.[22] In late 1992, Cobain was photographed in a
T-shirt with 'Grunge is Dead' printed on its front[23] and the genre's
decline started to be widely discussed.[24][25] The [death of
Cobain](/death_of_Kurt_Cobain "wikilink") in 1994, as well as Pearl
Jam's touring problems, marked a decline for grunge that year.[26]
Problems of addiction for [Layne Staley](/Layne_Staley "wikilink") of
[Alice in Chains](/Alice_in_Chains "wikilink") led to the band
cancelling scheduled dates in 1995.[27] When grunge was mainstream,
major record labels began signing and promoting bands emulating the
genre.[28] In spite of the fact that bands such as Bush[29][30][31] and
Candlebox[32] have been categorized as grunge, both bands have also been
categorized as post-grunge.[33] [thumb\|right\|200px\|Live, one of the
first post-grunge bands, performing in
2013.](/File:LIVE_(band).jpg "wikilink") Collective Soul[34] and
[Live](/Live_(band) "wikilink")[35] are two other bands categorized as
post-grunge that emerged along with Bush and Candlebox. Bush, Candlebox,
Collective Soul and Live all achieved mainstream success; Candlebox's
[self-titled album](/Candlebox_(album) "wikilink") was certified by the
[Recording Industry Association of
America](/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America "wikilink") (RIAA)
and, according to [Nielsen SoundScan](/Nielsen_SoundScan "wikilink"),
sold at least 4,000,000 copies.[36] Its song "Far Behind" peaked at
number 18 on the [*Billboard* Hot
100](/Billboard_Hot_100 "wikilink").[37] Collective Soul's song "Shine"
peaked at number 11 on the same chart[38] and was certified gold by the
RIAA in September 1994. Collective Soul's album *[Hints Allegations and
Things Left
Unsaid](/Hints_Allegations_and_Things_Left_Unsaid "wikilink")* was
certified 2x platinum by the RIAA, and the band's [self-titled album
released in 1995](/Collective_Soul_(1995_album) "wikilink") was
certified 3x platinum by the RIAA. Bush's debut studio album *[Sixteen
Stone](/Sixteen_Stone "wikilink")* was certified by the RIAA and the
band's second studio album *[Razorblade
Suitcase](/Razorblade_Suitcase "wikilink")*, which peaked at number 1 on
the [*Billboard* 200](/Billboard_200 "wikilink"),[39] was certified 3x
platinum by the RIAA. Carl Williott of
[Stereogum](/Stereogum "wikilink") called Bush's album *Sixteen Stone*
"a harbinger of pop dominance".[40] Live's album *[Throwing
Copper](/Throwing_Copper "wikilink")* was certified 8x platinum by the
RIAA, and the band's album *[Secret
Samadhi](/Secret_Samadhi "wikilink")* was certified 2x platinum by the
RIAA. Both *Throwing Copper* and *Secret Samadhi* peaked at number 1 on
the *Billboard* 200.[41]

[thumb\|Post-grunge band Foo Fighters performing live in
2007](/File:Foo_Fighters_Live_21.jpg "wikilink") In 1995, former Nirvana
drummer [Dave Grohl](/Dave_Grohl "wikilink")'s newer band [Foo
Fighters](/Foo_Fighters "wikilink") helped to popularize post-grunge and
define its parameters, becoming one of the most commercially successful
[rock](/rock_music "wikilink") bands in the United States, aided by
considerable airplay on [MTV](/MTV "wikilink").[42] Like grunge bands
such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, [Soundgarden](/Soundgarden "wikilink"), and
Alice in Chains, the post-grunge band Candlebox was from
[Seattle](/Seattle "wikilink"), but post-grunge was marked by a
broadening of the geographical base of grunge, with bands categorized as
post-grunge such as [York,
Pennsylvania](/York,_Pennsylvania "wikilink")'s Live,[43]
[Atlanta](/Atlanta "wikilink"),
[Georgia](/Georgia_(U.S._state) "wikilink")'s Collective Soul,
Australia's [Silverchair](/Silverchair "wikilink") and England's Bush,
who all paved the way for later post-grunge bands.[44][45] Female solo
artist Alanis Morissette's 1995 album *[Jagged Little
Pill](/Jagged_Little_Pill "wikilink")*, which is considered a
post-grunge album, became a hit[46] and was certified 16x platinum by
the RIAA in 1998 having sold at least 15,000,000 copies in the United
States.[47] Matchbox Twenty's debut album *[Yourself or Someone Like
You](/Yourself_or_Someone_Like_You "wikilink")*, which was released in
1996, was a success during the late 1990s; it was certified 12x platinum
by the RIAA.
