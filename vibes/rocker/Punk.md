![](punk-27947.jpg "punk-27947.jpg")

The **punk subculture** includes a diverse array of
[ideologies](Punk_ideologies "wikilink"),
[fashion](Punk_fashion "wikilink"), and other forms of expression,
[visual art](Punk_visual_art "wikilink"), dance,
[literature](Punk_literature "wikilink") and film. It is largely
characterised by anti-establishment views, the promotion of individual
freedom, [DIY ethics](DIY_ethic "wikilink"), and is centred on a loud,
aggressive genre of rock music called [punk rock](punk_rock "wikilink").
Its adherents are referred to as "punks".

Punk politics cover the entire political spectrum. The punk ethos is
primarily made up of beliefs such as non-conformity,
[anti-authoritarianism](anti-authoritarianism "wikilink"),
[anti-corporatism](anti-corporatism "wikilink"), a [do-it-yourself
ethic](DIY_ethic "wikilink"),
[anti-consumerist](anti-consumerist "wikilink"), anti-conservative,
anti-[corporate greed](corporate_greed "wikilink"), [direct
action](direct_action "wikilink") and not "[selling
out](selling_out "wikilink")".

There is a wide range of punk fashion, including deliberately offensive
T-shirts, leather jackets, [Dr. Martens](Dr._Martens "wikilink") boots,
hairstyles such as brightly coloured hair and spiked mohawks, cosmetics,
tattoos, jewellery and [body
modification](body_modification "wikilink"). Women in the hardcore scene
typically wore masculine clothing.[1]

An important aspect of punk was creating explicitly outward identities
of sexuality. Everything that was normally supposed to be hidden was
brought to the front.

Punk aesthetics determine the type of art punks enjoy, which typically
has [underground](underground_art "wikilink"),
[minimalist](minimalism "wikilink"),
[iconoclastic](iconoclasm "wikilink") and [satirical](satire "wikilink")
sensibilities. Punk has generated a considerable amount of poetry and
[prose](prose "wikilink"), and has its own [underground
press](underground_press "wikilink") in the form of
[zines](punk_zine "wikilink"). Many [punk-themed
films](List_of_punk_films "wikilink") and videos have been made.

## History

![](Young_punk_US-c1984.jpg "fig:Young_punk_US-c1984.jpg") The punk
subculture emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States in the
mid-1970s. Exactly which region originated punk has long been a matter
of controversy within the movement.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8] Early punk had
an abundance of antecedents and influences, and [Jon
Savage](Jon_Savage "wikilink") describes the subculture as a
"[bricolage](bricolage "wikilink")" of almost every previous youth
culture in the [Western world](Western_world "wikilink") since World War
II, "stuck together with safety pins".[9] Various musical,
[philosophical](philosophical_movement "wikilink"),
[political](political_movement "wikilink"), literary and [artistic
movements](artistic_movements "wikilink") influenced the subculture.

In the late 1970s, the subculture began to diversify, which led to the
proliferation of factions such as [new wave](New_wave_music "wikilink"),
[post-punk](post-punk "wikilink"), [2
Tone](2_Tone_(music_genre) "wikilink"), [pop punk](pop_punk "wikilink"),
[hardcore punk](hardcore_punk "wikilink"), [no
wave](no_wave "wikilink"), [street punk](street_punk "wikilink") and
[Oi!](Oi! "wikilink"). Hardcore punk, street punk and Oi! sought to do
away with the frivolities introduced in the later years of the original
punk movement.[10] The punk subculture influenced other [underground
music](underground_music "wikilink") scenes such as [alternative
rock](alternative_rock "wikilink"), [indie
music](indie_music "wikilink"), [crossover
thrash](crossover_thrash "wikilink") and the extreme subgenres of [heavy
metal](Heavy_metal_music "wikilink") (mainly [thrash
metal](thrash_metal "wikilink"), [death metal](death_metal "wikilink"),
[speed metal](speed_metal "wikilink"), and the
[NWOBHM](NWOBHM "wikilink")).[11] A new movement in the United States
became visible in the early and mid-1990s that sought to revive the punk
movement, doing away with some of the trappings of hardcore.

## Music

![](The_band_photo_of_the_Buzzcocks_(Edit).jpg "fig:The_band_photo_of_the_Buzzcocks_(Edit).jpg")
at the [Cropredy Festival](Cropredy_Festival "wikilink") in 2009\]\] The
punk subculture is centered on a loud, aggressive genre of rock music
called punk rock, usually played by bands consisting of a vocalist, one
or two electric guitarists, an electric bassist and a drummer. In some
bands, the musicians contribute backup vocals, which typically consist
of shouted slogans, choruses or [football-style
chants](football_chant "wikilink").

While most punk rock uses the distorted guitars and noisy drumming
sounds derived from 1960s [garage rock](garage_rock "wikilink") and
1970s [pub rock](Pub_rock_(United_Kingdom) "wikilink"), some punk bands
incorporate elements from other subgenres, such as [surf
rock](surf_rock "wikilink"), [rockabilly](rockabilly "wikilink") or
[reggae](reggae "wikilink"). Most punk rock songs are short, have simple
and somewhat basic arrangements using relatively few chords, and they
typically have lyrics that express punk ideologies and values, although
some punk lyrics are about lighter topics such as partying or [romantic
relationships](Intimate_relationship "wikilink").

Different punk subcultures often distinguish themselves by having a
unique style of punk rock, although not every style of punk rock has its
own associated subculture.

The earliest form of music to be called "punk rock" was 1960s [garage
rock](garage_rock "wikilink"), and the term was applied to the genre
retroactively by influential rock critics in the early
1970s.[12][13][14] In the late 1960s, music now referred to as
[protopunk](protopunk "wikilink") originated as a garage rock revival in
the northeastern United States.[15] The first distinct music scene to
claim the *punk* label appeared in New York City between 1974 and
1976.[16] Around the same time or soon afterward, a punk scene developed
in London.[17] Los Angeles subsequently became home to the third major
punk scene.[18] These three cities formed the backbone of the burgeoning
movement, but there were also other punk scenes in cities such as
[Brisbane](Brisbane "wikilink"), [Melbourne](Melbourne "wikilink") and
[Sydney](Sydney "wikilink") in Australia,
[Vancouver](Vancouver "wikilink") and [Montreal](Montreal "wikilink") in
Canada, and [Boston](Boston "wikilink") and [San
Francisco](San_Francisco "wikilink") in the United States.

The punk subculture advocates a do-it-yourself (DIY) ethic. During the
subculture's infancy members were almost all from a lower economic
class, and had become tired of the affluence that was associated with
popular rock music at the time. Punks would publish their own music or
sign with small independent labels, in hopes to combat what they saw as
a money hungry music industry. The DIY ethic is still popular with
punks.

The New York City punk rock scene arose from a subcultural underground
promoted by artists, reporters, musicians and a wide variety of
non-mainstream enthusiasts. [The Velvet
Underground](The_Velvet_Underground "wikilink")'s harsh and experimental
yet often melodic sound in the mid to late-1960s, much of it relating to
[transgressive media](Transgressive_art "wikilink") work by visual
artist [Andy Warhol](Andy_Warhol "wikilink"), is credited for
influencing 1970s bands such as the [New York
Dolls](New_York_Dolls "wikilink"), [The Stooges](The_Stooges "wikilink")
and the [Ramones](Ramones "wikilink").[19] Early New York City punk
bands were often short-lived, in part due to widespread use of
[recreational drugs](Recreational_drug_use "wikilink"), promiscuous sex,
and sometimes violent power struggles, but the relative popularity of
the music led to the evolution of punk into a movement and
[lifestyle](Lifestyle_(sociology) "wikilink").

## Ideologies

![](Punkertreffen_1984_-_Ausschnitt.jpg "fig:Punkertreffen_1984_-_Ausschnitt.jpg")
![](Punks_burning_a_flag.jpg "fig:Punks_burning_a_flag.jpg")
![](AntiIII%25AntiAntiRefugeeBoiseanPunk.jpg "fig:AntiIII%25AntiAntiRefugeeBoiseanPunk.jpg")
regarding refugee policy in Boise, Idaho in November 2015\]\] Although
punks are frequently categorised as having left-wing, revolutionary,
anarchist or progressive views, punk political ideology covers the
entire [political spectrum](political_spectrum "wikilink"). Punk-related
ideologies are mostly concerned with individual freedom and
[anti-establishment](anti-establishment "wikilink") views. Common punk
viewpoints include [individual liberty](Civil_liberties "wikilink"),
[anti-authoritarianism](anti-authoritarianism "wikilink"), a [DIY
ethic](DIY_ethic "wikilink"), non-conformity,
anti-[collectivism](collectivism "wikilink"),
anti-[corporatism](corporatism "wikilink"), anti-government, [direct
action](direct_action "wikilink") and not "[selling
out](selling_out "wikilink")".

Some individuals within the punk subculture hold
[right-wing](Right-wing_politics "wikilink") views (such as those
associated with the *[Conservative Punk](Conservative_Punk "wikilink")*
website), [libertarian](Libertarianism "wikilink") views,
[neo-Nazi](Neo-Nazism "wikilink") views ([Nazi
punk](Nazi_punk "wikilink")), or are [apolitical](apolitical "wikilink")
(e.g., [horror punk](horror_punk "wikilink")).

Early British punks expressed [nihilistic](nihilism "wikilink") and
[anarchist](anarchist "wikilink") views with the slogan *No Future*,
which came from the [Sex Pistols](Sex_Pistols "wikilink") song "[God
Save the Queen](God_Save_the_Queen_(Sex_Pistols_song) "wikilink")". In
the United States, punks had a different approach to nihilism which was
less anarchistic than the British punks.[20] Punk nihilism was expressed
in the use of "harder, more self-destructive, consciousness-obliterating
substances like heroin, or methamphetamine"[21]

The issue of authenticity is important in the punk subculture—the
pejorative term "[poseur](poseur "wikilink")" is applied to those who
associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed
not to share or understand the underlying values or philosophy.

## Fashion

![](Punk_fashion_circa_1986.jpg "fig:Punk_fashion_circa_1986.jpg")
symbol painted on the coat of the man on the right\]\]
![](Gendou2012+.jpg "fig:Gendou2012+.jpg") Early punk fashion adapted
everyday objects for aesthetic effect: ripped clothing was held together
by safety pins or wrapped with tape; ordinary clothing was customised by
embellishing it with marker or adorning it with paint; a black [bin
liner](bin_liner "wikilink") became a dress, shirt or skirt; safety pins
and razor blades were used as jewellery. Also popular have been leather,
rubber, and [PVC](Polyvinyl_chloride "wikilink") clothing that is often
associated with transgressive
[sexuality](Human_sexual_activity "wikilink"), like
[BDSM](Bondage_(BDSM) "wikilink") and
[S&M](Sadism_and_masochism "wikilink").[22] A designer associated with
early UK punk fashion was [Vivienne
Westwood](Vivienne_Westwood "wikilink"), who made clothes for [Malcolm
McLaren](Malcolm_McLaren "wikilink")'s boutique in the [King's
Road](King's_Road "wikilink"), which became famous as
"[SEX](Sex_(boutique) "wikilink")".

Many punks wear tight "drainpipe" jeans, plaid/tartan trousers, kilts or
skirts, T-shirts, leather jackets (often decorated with painted band
logos, pins and buttons, and metal studs or spikes), and footwear such
as high-cut [Chuck Taylors](Chuck_Taylor_All-Stars "wikilink"),
[trainers](trainers "wikilink"), [skate shoes](skate_shoes "wikilink"),
[brothel creepers](brothel_creeper "wikilink"), Dr. Martens boots, and
army boots. Early punks occasionally wore clothes displaying a
[swastika](swastika "wikilink") for shock value, but most contemporary
punks are staunchly anti-racist and are more likely to wear a
crossed-out swastika symbol than a pro-Nazi symbol. Some punks cut their
hair into [Mohawks](Mohawk_hairstyle "wikilink") or other dramatic
shapes, style it to stand in spikes, and colour it with vibrant,
unnatural hues.

Some punks are *anti-fashion*, arguing that punk should be defined by
music or ideology. This is most common in the post-1980s US [hardcore
punk](hardcore_punk "wikilink") scene, where members of the subculture
often dressed in plain T-shirts and jeans, rather than the more
elaborate outfits and spiked, dyed hair of their British counterparts.
Many groups adopt a look based on street clothes and [working
class](working_class "wikilink") outfits. Hardcore punk fans adopted a
*dressed-down* style of T-shirts, jeans, combat boots or trainers and
[crewcuts](crewcut "wikilink"). Women in the hardcore scene typically
wore army trousers, band T-shirts, and hooded jumpers.[23]

The style of the 1980s hardcore scene contrasted with the more
provocative fashion styles of late 1970s punk rockers (elaborate
[hairdos](punk_hair "wikilink"), torn clothes, patches, safety pins,
studs, spikes, etc.). [Circle Jerks](Circle_Jerks "wikilink") frontman
[Keith Morris](Keith_Morris "wikilink") described early hardcore fashion
as "the...punk scene was basically based on English fashion. But we had
nothing to do with that. [Black Flag](Black_Flag_(band) "wikilink") and
the Circle Jerks were so far from that. We looked like the kid who
worked at the gas station or submarine shop."[24] Henry Rollins echoes
Morris' point, stating that for him getting dressed up meant putting on
a black shirt and some dark pants; Rollins viewed an interest in fashion
as being a distraction.[25] Jimmy Gestapo from [Murphy's
Law](Murphy's_Law_(band) "wikilink") describes his own transition from
dressing in a punk style (spiked hair and a [bondage
belt](bondage_belt "wikilink")) to adopting a hardcore style (i.e. boots
and a shaved head) as being based on a need for more functional
clothing.[26] An punk scholar states that "hardcore kids do not look
like punks", since hardcore scene members wore basic clothing and short
haircuts, in contrast to the "embellished leather jackets and pants"
worn in the punk scene.[27]

In contrast to Morris' and Rollins' views, another punk scholar claims
that the standard hardcore punk clothing and styles included torn jeans,
leather jackets, spiked armbands and dog collars, mohawk hairstyles, and
DIY ornamentation of clothes with studs, painted band names, political
statements, and patches.[28] Yet another punk scholar describes the look
that was common in the San Francisco hardcore scene as consisting of
biker-style leather jackets, chains, studded wristbands, pierced noses
and multiple piercings, painted or tattooed statements (e.g. an anarchy
symbol) and hairstyles ranging from military-style haircuts dyed black
or blonde, to mohawks and shaved heads.[29]

The [Metropolitan Museum of Art](Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art "wikilink")
in 2013 hosted a comprehensive exhibit, *PUNK: Chaos to Couture*, that
examined the techniques of hardware, distress, and re-purposing in punk
fashion.[30]

## Gender and gender expression

![](Louise_Distras_AWOD.jpg "fig:Louise_Distras_AWOD.jpg"), advocate of
crowdfunding, performing\]\] In the United Kingdom, the advent of
[punk](Punk_rock "wikilink") in the late 1970s with its "anyone can do
it" ethos led to women making significant contributions.[31][32] In
contrast to the [rock music](rock_music "wikilink") and [heavy
metal](heavy_metal_music "wikilink") scenes of the 1970s, which were
dominated by men, the anarchic, counter-cultural mindset of the punk
scene in mid- and late 1970s encouraged women to participate. "That was
the beauty of the punk thing," [Chrissie
Hynde](Chrissie_Hynde "wikilink") later said." \[Sexual\] discrimination
didn't exist in that scene."[33] This participation played a role in the
historical development of punk music, especially in the U.S. and U.K. at
that time, and continues to influence and enable future generations.[34]

Rock historian Helen Reddington states that the popular image of young
punk women musicians as focused on the fashion aspects of the scene
(fishnet stockings, spiky blond hair, etc.) was stereotypical. She
states that many, if not most women punks were more interested in the
ideology and socio-political implications, rather than the
fashion.[35][36] Music historian Caroline Coon contends that before
punk, women in rock music were virtually invisible; in contrast, in
punk, she argues "\[i\]t would be possible to write the whole history of
punk music without mentioning any male bands at all – and I think a lot
of \[people\] would find that very surprising."[37][38] [Johnny
Rotten](Johnny_Rotten "wikilink") wrote that ‘During the Pistols era,
women were out there playing with the men, taking us on in equal terms
... It wasn’t combative, but compatible.’[39] Women were involved in
bands such as [The Runaways](The_Runaways "wikilink"), [The
Slits](The_Slits "wikilink"), [The Raincoats](The_Raincoats "wikilink"),
[Mo-dettes](Mo-dettes "wikilink"), and [Dolly
Mixture](Dolly_Mixture_(band) "wikilink"), [The
Innocents](The_Innocents_(UK_punk_band) "wikilink").

Others take issue with the notion of equal recognition, such as
guitarist [Viv Albertine](Viv_Albertine "wikilink"), who stated that
"the A&R men, the bouncers, the sound mixers, no one took us seriously..
So, no, we got no respect anywhere we went. People just didn't want us
around."[40][41] The anti-establishment stance of punk opened the space
for women who were treated like outsiders in a male-dominated industry.
[Sonic Youth](Sonic_Youth "wikilink")'s [Kim
Gordon](Kim_Gordon "wikilink") states, "I think women are natural
anarchists, because you're always operating in a male framework."[42]

### Body and appearance

For some punks, the body was a symbol of opposition, a political
statement expressing disgust of all that was "normal" and socially
accepted.[43] The idea was to make others outside of the subculture
question their own views, which made gender, gender presentation and
gender identity a popular factor to be played with. Men could look like
women, women could look like men, or one could look like both or
neither. In some ways, punk helped to tear apart the normalised view of
gender as a dichotomy. There was a notable amount of cross-dressing in
the punk scene; it was not unusual to see men wearing ripped-up skirts,
fishnet tights and excessive makeup, or to see women with shaved heads
wearing oversized plaid shirts and jean jackets and heavy combat
boots.[44] Punk created a new cultural space for androgyny and all kinds
of gender expression.[45]

Some scholars have claimed that punk has been problematic towards gender
by stating its overall resistance to expressing any kind of popular
conceptions of femininity. In trying to reject societal norms, punk
embraced one societal norm by deciding that strength and anger was best
expressed through masculinity, defining masculine as the "default" in
the world they were trying to create, where gender did not exist or had
no meaning.[46] However, the main reasoning behind this argument equates
femininity with popular conceptions of beauty, which punk rejected.
![](Carrie_Brownstein.jpg "fig:Carrie_Brownstein.jpg") from the
punk-indie band [Sleater-Kinney](Sleater-Kinney "wikilink"), performing
at Vegoose in 2005\]\] One part of punk was a creating explicitly
outward identities of sexuality. Everything that was normally supposed
to be hidden was brought to the front, both literally and figuratively.
This could mean anything from wearing bras and underwear on top of
clothing to wearing nothing but a bra and underwear. Although that act
would seem sexualised in a normal context, to punks it was just another
way to be obscene in the eyes of "others".[47] Punk seemed to allow
women to sexualize themselves and still be taken seriously; however,
many argue that this was always in terms of what the male punks
wanted.[48]

Conversely, the masculine nature of punk allowed many women to recreate
an almost farcical masculinity by using their female bodies in the same
way men tended to use theirs. Punk women could be filthy and horrible
and use their femininity to make what they were doing even more shocking
to their audience. It became popular for some punk women to accentuate
their bodies in ridiculous ways, such as stuffing their pants to make
exaggerated labia outlines, as if parodying male crotch stuffing.[49] At
one concert, Donita Sparks, lead singer of the band
[L7](L7_(band) "wikilink"), pulled out her tampon and threw it into the
audience. In many ways, female punks were showing unapologetically (and
exaggeratedly) what it truly meant to be a woman, with nothing soft or
"classically feminine" to hide behind.[50]

### Riot grrrl

[Riot grrrl](Riot_grrrl "wikilink") is an
[underground](underground_music "wikilink")
[feminist](feminist "wikilink") [hardcore
punk](hardcore_punk "wikilink") movement that originated in Washington,
D.C. in the early 1990s,[51] and the [Pacific
Northwest](Pacific_Northwest "wikilink"), especially [Olympia,
Washington](Olympia,_Washington "wikilink").[52] It is often associated
with [third-wave feminism](third-wave_feminism "wikilink"), which is
sometimes seen as its starting point. It has also been described as a
musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving
as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express
themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several
years.[53]

## Visual art

Punk aesthetics determine the type of art punks enjoy, usually with
[underground](underground_art "wikilink"),
[minimalistic](minimalism "wikilink"),
[iconoclastic](iconoclasm "wikilink") and [satirical](satire "wikilink")
sensibilities. Punk artwork graces [album
covers](album_cover "wikilink"), [flyers](flyer_(pamphlet) "wikilink")
for concerts, and [punk zines](punk_zine "wikilink"). Usually
straightforward with clear messages, punk art is often concerned with
political issues such as [social injustice](social_injustice "wikilink")
and economic disparity. The use of images of suffering to shock and
create feelings of empathy in the viewer is common. Alternatively, punk
artwork may contain images of selfishness, stupidity, or apathy to
provoke contempt in the viewer.

Much of the earlier artwork was black and white, because it was
distributed in [zines](zines "wikilink") reproduced by photocopying at
work, school or at copy shops. Punk art also uses the [mass
production](mass_production "wikilink") aesthetic of [Andy
Warhol](Andy_Warhol "wikilink")'s Factory studio. Punk played a hand in
the revival of [stencil](stencil "wikilink") art, spearheaded by
[Crass](Crass "wikilink"). The
[Situationists](Situationist_International "wikilink") also influenced
the look of punk art, particularity that of the [Sex
Pistols](Sex_Pistols "wikilink") created by [Jamie
Reid](Jamie_Reid "wikilink"). Punk art often utilises
[collage](collage "wikilink"), exemplified by the art of [Jamie
Reid](Jamie_Reid "wikilink"), Crass, The Clash, [Dead
Kennedys](Dead_Kennedys "wikilink"),and [Winston
Smith](Winston_Smith_(artist) "wikilink"). [John
Holmstrom](John_Holmstrom "wikilink") was a punk
[cartoonist](cartoonist "wikilink") who created work for the
[Ramones](Ramones "wikilink") and *[Punk](Punk_(magazine) "wikilink")*.

The [Stuckism](Stuckism "wikilink") art movement had its origin in punk,
and titled its first major show *[The Stuckists Punk
Victorian](The_Stuckists_Punk_Victorian "wikilink")* at the [Walker Art
Gallery](Walker_Art_Gallery "wikilink") during the 2004 [Liverpool
Biennial](Liverpool_Biennial "wikilink"). [Charles
Thomson](Charles_Thomson_(artist) "wikilink"), co-founder of the group,
described punk as "a major breakthrough" in his art.[54]

## Dance

![](Moshing.jpg "fig:Moshing.jpg") Two dance styles associated with punk
are [pogo dancing](pogo_(dance) "wikilink") and
[moshing](moshing "wikilink").[55] The pogo is a dance in which the
dancers jump up and down, while either remaining on the spot or moving
around; the dance takes its name from its resemblance to the use of a
pogo stick, especially in a common version of the dance, where an
individual keeps their torso stiff, their arms rigid, and their legs
close together. Pogo dancing is closely associated with punk rock and is
a precursor to moshing. Moshing or slamdancing is a style of dance where
participants push or slam into each other, typically during a live music
show. It is usually associated with "aggressive" music genres, such as
hardcore punk and [thrash metal](thrash_metal "wikilink"). [Stage
diving](Stage_diving "wikilink") and [crowd
surfing](crowd_surfing "wikilink") were originally associated with
[protopunk](protopunk "wikilink") bands such as The Stooges, and have
appeared at punk, metal and rock concerts. [Ska
punk](Ska_punk "wikilink") promoted an updated version of
[skanking](skank_(dance) "wikilink"). [Hardcore
dancing](Hardcore_dancing "wikilink") is a later development influenced
by all of the above-mentioned styles.
[Psychobillies](Psychobilly "wikilink") prefer to "wreck", a form of
slam dancing that involves people punching each other in the chest and
arms as they move around the circle pit.

## Literature

![](UK_and_US_zines.jpg "UK_and_US_zines.jpg")

Punk has generated a considerable amount of poetry and
[prose](prose "wikilink"). Punk has its own [underground
press](underground_press "wikilink") in the form of [punk
zines](punk_zine "wikilink"), which feature news, gossip, cultural
criticism, and interviews. Some zines take the form of
[perzines](perzine "wikilink"). Important punk zines include *[Maximum
RocknRoll](Maximum_RocknRoll "wikilink")*, *[Punk
Planet](Punk_Planet "wikilink")*, *[No Cure](No_Cure "wikilink")*,
*[Cometbus](Cometbus "wikilink")*,
*[Flipside](Flipside_(fanzine) "wikilink")*, and *[Search &
Destroy](RE/Search "wikilink")*. Several novels, biographies,
autobiographies, and comic books have been written about punk. *[Love
and Rockets](Love_and_Rockets_(comics) "wikilink")* is a comic with a
plot involving the Los Angeles punk scene.

Just as zines played an important role in spreading information in the
punk era (e.g. British fanzines like Mark Perry's *[Sniffin
Glue](Sniffin_Glue "wikilink")* and Shane MacGowan's *Bondage*), zines
also played an important role in the hardcore scene. In the pre-Internet
era, zines enabled readers to learn about bands, shows, clubs, and
record labels. Zines typically included reviews of shows and records,
interviews with bands, letters to the editor, and advertisements for
records and labels. Zines were DIY products, "proudly amateur, usually
handmade, and always independent", and during the "’90s, zines were the
primary way to stay up on punk and hardcore."[56] They were the "blogs,
comment sections, and social networks of their day."[57]

In the American Midwest, the zine *Touch and Go* described the regional
hardcore scene from 1979 to 1983.[58] *We Got Power* described the LA
scene from 1981 to 1984, and included show reviews of and interviews
with such bands as Vancouver's [D.O.A.](D.O.A._(band) "wikilink"), the
[Misfits](Misfits_(band) "wikilink"), [Black
Flag](Black_Flag_(band) "wikilink"), [Suicidal
Tendencies](Suicidal_Tendencies "wikilink") and the [Circle
Jerks](Circle_Jerks "wikilink").[59] *My Rules* was a photo zine that
included photos of hardcore shows from across the US. *In Effect*, which
began in 1988, described the New York City scene.[60]

Punk poets include: [Richard Hell](Richard_Hell "wikilink"), [Jim
Carroll](Jim_Carroll "wikilink"), [Patti Smith](Patti_Smith "wikilink"),
[John Cooper Clarke](John_Cooper_Clarke "wikilink"), [Seething
Wells](Steven_Wells "wikilink"), [Raegan
Butcher](Raegan_Butcher "wikilink"), and [Attila the
Stockbroker](Attila_the_Stockbroker "wikilink"). [The Medway
Poets](The_Medway_Poets "wikilink") performance group included punk
musician [Billy Childish](Billy_Childish "wikilink") and had an
influence on [Tracey Emin](Tracey_Emin "wikilink"). Jim Carroll's
autobiographical works are among the first known examples of punk
literature. The punk subculture has inspired the
[cyberpunk](cyberpunk "wikilink") and [steampunk](steampunk "wikilink")
literature genres, and has even contributed (through Iggy Pop) to
classical scholarship.[61]

[Punkcast](Punkcast "wikilink")\]\] Many [punk-themed
films](List_of_punk_films "wikilink") have been made. The [No Wave
Cinema](No_Wave_Cinema "wikilink") and [Remodernist

aesthetics. Several famous punk bands have participated in movies, such
as the Ramones in *[Rock 'n' Roll High

## Perspectives on drugs and alcohol

### Inhalable solvents

"\[\[Intoxicative_inhalant\|\[Glue\] sniffing\]\] was adopted by punks
because public perceptions of sniffing fitted in with their self-image.
Originally used experimentally and as a cheap high, adult disgust and
hostility encouraged punks to use glue sniffing as a way of shocking
society."[64] Model airplane glue and contact cement were among the
numerous solvents and inhalants used by punks to achieve euphoria and
intoxication. Glue was typically inhaled by placing a quantity in a
plastic bag and "huffing" (inhaling) the vapour. Liquid solvents were
typically inhaled by soaking a rag with the solvent and inhaling the
vapour. While users inhale solvents for the intoxicating effects, the
practice can be harmful or fatal.

### Straight edge

![](Straight_Edge_Tattoo.JPG "fig:Straight_Edge_Tattoo.JPG") [Straight
edge](Straight_edge "wikilink") is a philosophy of hardcore punk
culture, adeherents of which refrain from using alcohol, tobacco, and
other recreational drugs, in reaction to the excesses of punk
subculture.[65][66] For some, this extends to refraining from engaging
in promiscuous sex, following a vegetarian or [vegan](vegan "wikilink")
diet, and not drinking coffee or taking prescribed medicine.[67] The
term *straight edge* was adopted from the 1981 song "[Straight
Edge](Straight_Edge_(song) "wikilink")" by the hardcore punk band [Minor
Threat](Minor_Threat "wikilink").[68]

Straight edge emerged amid the early-1980s hardcore punk scene. Since
then, a wide variety of beliefs and ideas have been associated with the
movement, including vegetarianism and animal rights.[69][70] Ross
Haenfler writes that as of the late 1990s, approximately three out of
four straight edge participants were vegetarian or vegan.[71] While the
commonly expressed aspects of the straight edge subculture have been
abstinence from alcohol, nicotine, and illegal drugs, there have been
considerable variations on how far to take the interpretations of
"abstaining from intoxicants" or "living drug-free". Disagreements often
arise as to the primary reasons for living straight edge. Straight edge
politics are primarily left-wing and revolutionary but there have been
conservative offshoots.[72]

In 1999, William Tsitsos wrote that straight edge had gone through three
eras since its founding in the early 1980s.[73] [Bent
edge](Bent_edge "wikilink") began as a counter-movement to straight edge
by members of the Washington, D.C.
[hardcore](Washington,_D.C._hardcore "wikilink") scene who were
frustrated by the rigidity and intolerance in the scene.[74] During the
[youth crew](youth_crew "wikilink") era, which started in the mid-1980s,
the influence of music on the straight edge scene was at an all-time
high. By the early 1990s, militant straight edge was a well-known part
of the wider punk scene. In the early to mid-1990s, straight edge spread
from the United States to Northern Europe,[75] Eastern Europe,[76] the
Middle East,[77] and South America.[78] By the beginning of the 2000s,
militant straight edge punks had largely left the broader straight edge
culture and movement.[79]

## Lifestyle and community

![](924_Gilman_Street_(3).jpg "924_Gilman_Street_(3).jpg")

Punks come from all culture and economic classes. Compared to some
subcultures, punk ideology is much closer to [gender
equality](gender_equality "wikilink"). Although the punk subculture is
mostly [anti-racist](Anti-racism "wikilink"), it is overwhelmingly
white.[80] However, members of other groups (such as African Americans,
other [black people](black_people "wikilink"), Latinos, and Asians) have
contributed to the development of the subculture.[81] Substance abuse
has sometimes been a part of the punk scene, with the notable exception
of the straight edge movement. Violence has also sometimes appeared in
the punk subculture, but has been opposed by some subsets of the
subculture, such as the pacifist strain
[anarcho-punk](anarcho-punk "wikilink").[82]
![](924_Gilman_Street_(4).jpg "fig:924_Gilman_Street_(4).jpg") Punks
often form a local scene, which can have as few as half a dozen members
in a small town, or as many as thousands of in a major city.[83] A local
scene usually has a small group of dedicated punks surrounded by a more
casual periphery. A typical punk scene is made up of punk and hardcore
bands, fans who attend concerts, protests, and other events, zine
publishers, reviewers, and other writers, visual artists illustrating
zines, and creating posters and album covers, show promoters, and people
who work at music venues or [independent record
labels](independent_record_label "wikilink").[84]

[Squatting](Squatting "wikilink") plays a role in many punk communities,
providing shelter and other forms of support. Squats in abandoned or
condemned housing, and communal "[punk houses](punk_house "wikilink")"
often provide bands a place to stay while they are touring. There are
some punk [communes](commune_(intentional_community) "wikilink"), such
as Essex's [Dial House](Dial_House_(Essex,_England) "wikilink"). The
Internet has been playing an increasingly large role in punk,
specifically in the form of [virtual
communities](virtual_communities "wikilink") and file sharing programs
for trading music files.[85]

### Authenticity

In the punk and hardcore subcultures, members of the scene are often
evaluated in terms of the
[authenticity](authenticity_(philosophy) "wikilink") of their commitment
to the values or philosophies of the scene, which may range from
political beliefs to lifestyle practices. In the punk subculture, the
epithet *[poseur](poseur "wikilink")* (or "poser") is used to describe
"a person who habitually pretends to be something \[they are\] not." The
term is used to refer to a person who adopts the dress, speech, and/or
mannerisms of a particular subculture, yet who is deemed to not share or
understand the values or philosophy of the subculture.[86][87][88]

While this perceived inauthenticity is viewed with scorn and contempt by
members of the subculture, the definition of the term and to whom it
should be applied is subjective. An article in *Drowned in Sound* argues
that 1980s-era "[hardcore](hardcore_punk "wikilink") is the true spirit
of punk", because "after all the poseurs and fashionistas fucked off to
the next trend of skinny pink ties with [New
Romantic](New_Romantic "wikilink") haircuts, singing wimpy lyrics", the
punk scene consisted only of people "completely dedicated to the
[DIY](DIY "wikilink") ethics".[89]

In the discussion of authenticity it is necessary to recognize the
origins of punk music. Proto-punk bands came out of garage-rock during
the late 1960s. Usually white working class boys are credited for
pioneering the genre, however there were many women and people of color
who contributed to the original punk sound and aesthetic. Because the
original subculture meant to challenge everything about the mainstream,
usually in shocking ways, the "punk" that people usually picture became
inauthentic once it was brought to the mainstream; “‘Inauthentic’ punk
is a commercialized and debased form of an original ‘street’ form of
punk”(Sabin, 1999). This is the paradox of punk; as a subculture it must
always be evolving in order to stay out of the mainstream.

*Punk Girls* written by [Liz Ham](Liz_Ham "wikilink") is a
[photo-book](photo-book "wikilink") featuring 100 portraits of
Australian women in the punk subculture, and it was published in 2017 by
Manuscript Daily.[90][91][92][93][94] Discrimination against punk
subculture is explored with her photographs in the book; these *girls*
who are not mainstream, but "beautiful and talented".[95]

## Interactions with other subcultures

[Glam rockers](Glam_rock "wikilink") such as
[T.Rex](T.Rex_(band) "wikilink"), the [New York
Dolls](New_York_Dolls "wikilink") and [David
Bowie](David_Bowie "wikilink") had big influences on
[protopunk](protopunk "wikilink"), early punk rock, and the crossover
subgenre later called [glam punk](glam_punk "wikilink"). Particularly,
[David Bowie](David_Bowie "wikilink") himself supported the neophyte
punk bands of this time, and he later said after punk somewhat fell out
of fashion, "I think it's a crying shame that the category has
dissipated its importance." [96] Punk and [hip
hop](hip_hop_culture "wikilink") emerged around the same time in the
late 1970s New York City, and there has been some interaction between
the two subcultures. Some of the first hip hop [MCs](MC "wikilink")
called themselves punk rockers, and some [punk
fashions](punk_fashion "wikilink") have found their way into hip hop
dress and vice versa. [Malcolm McLaren](Malcolm_McLaren "wikilink")
played roles in introducing both punk and hip hop to the United Kingdom.
Hip hop later influenced some punk and
[hardcore](hardcore_punk "wikilink") bands, such as [Hed
PE](Hed_PE "wikilink"), [Blaggers I.T.A.](Blaggers_I.T.A. "wikilink"),
[Biohazard](Biohazard_(band) "wikilink"), [E.Town
Concrete](E.Town_Concrete "wikilink"), [The
Transplants](The_Transplants "wikilink") and
[Refused](Refused "wikilink").[97]

The [skinhead](skinhead "wikilink") subculture of the United Kingdom in
the late 1960s – which had almost disappeared in the early 1970s — was
revived in the late 1970s, partly because of the influence of punk rock,
especially the [Oi!](Oi! "wikilink") punk subgenre. Conversely,
[ska](ska "wikilink") and [reggae](reggae "wikilink"), popular among
[traditionalist skinheads](Trojan_skinhead "wikilink"), has influenced
several punk musicians. Punks and skinheads have had both antagonistic
and friendly relationships, depending on the social circumstances, time
period and geographic location.[98]

The punk and [heavy metal](heavy_metal_music "wikilink") subcultures
have shared some similarities since punk's inception. The early 1970s
protopunk scene had an influence on the development of heavy metal.
[Alice Cooper](Alice_Cooper "wikilink") was a forerunner of the fashion
and music of both the punk and metal subcultures.
[Motörhead](Motörhead "wikilink"), since their first album release in
1977, have enjoyed continued popularity in the punk scene, and their
now-deceased frontman [Lemmy](Lemmy "wikilink") was a fan of punk rock.
Genres such as [metalcore](metalcore "wikilink"),
[grindcore](grindcore "wikilink") and [crossover
thrash](crossover_thrash "wikilink") were greatly influenced by punk
rock and heavy metal. The [new wave of British heavy
metal](new_wave_of_British_heavy_metal "wikilink") influenced the [UK
82](UK_82 "wikilink")-style of bands like
[Discharge](Discharge_(band) "wikilink"), and hardcore was a primary
influence on [thrash metal](thrash_metal "wikilink") bands such as
[Metallica](Metallica "wikilink") and [Slayer](Slayer "wikilink"). The
early 1990s [grunge](grunge "wikilink") subculture was a fusion of punk
[anti-fashion](anti-fashion "wikilink") ideals and metal-influenced
guitar sounds. However, hardcore punk and grunge developed in part as
reactions against the heavy metal music that was popular during the
1980s.[99]

In punk's heyday, punks faced harassment and attacks from the general
public and from members of other subcultures. In the 1980s in the UK,
punks were sometimes involved in brawls with [Teddy
Boys](Teddy_Boy_(youth_culture) "wikilink"),
[greasers](greaser_(subculture) "wikilink"),
[bikers](Outlaw_motorcycle_club "wikilink"),
[mods](mod_(subculture) "wikilink") and members of other subcultures.
There was also considerable enmity between Positive punks (known today
as [goths](goth_subculture "wikilink")) and the glamorously dressed [New
Romantics](New_Romantic "wikilink").

In the late 1970s, punks were known to have had confrontations with
[hippies](hippies "wikilink") due to the contrasting ideologies and
backlash of the hippie culture.[100] Nevertheless, [Penny
Rimbaud](Penny_Rimbaud "wikilink") of the English anarcho-punk band
[Crass](Crass "wikilink") said that Crass was formed in memory of his
friend, the hippie [Wally Hope](Wally_Hope "wikilink").[101] Rimbaud
also said that Crass were heavily involved with the hippie movement
throughout the 1960s and 1970s, with Dial House being established in
1967. Many punks were often critical of Crass for their involvement in
the hippie movement. Like Crass, [Jello Biafra](Jello_Biafra "wikilink")
was influenced by the hippie movement and cited the
[yippies](yippie "wikilink") as a key influence on his political
activism and thinking, though he did write songs critical of
hippies.[102][103]

The [industrial](industrial_music "wikilink") and
[rivethead](rivethead "wikilink") subcultures have had several ties to
punk, in terms of music, fashion and attitude.

[Power pop](Power_pop "wikilink") music (as defined by groups such as
[Badfinger](Badfinger "wikilink"), [Cheap
Trick](Cheap_Trick "wikilink"), [The Knack](The_Knack "wikilink"), and
[The Romantics](The_Romantics "wikilink")) emerged in mostly the same
time-frame and geographical area as punk rock, and they shared a great
deal musically in terms of playing short songs loud and fast while
trying to emphasize catchy feelings. More melodic and pop-influenced
punk music have also often been wrapped alongside power pop bands under
the general "[new wave music](new_wave_music "wikilink")" label.[104] A
good example of a genre-straddling 'power pop punk' band is the popular
[Northern Ireland](Northern_Ireland "wikilink") group
[Protex](Protex "wikilink").[105] However, stylistically and lyrically,
power pop bands have tended to have a very "not-punk" top 40 commercial
pop music influence and a flashier, heavily teen-pop sense of fashion,
especially modern power pop groups such as [Stereo
Skyline](Stereo_Skyline "wikilink") and [All Time
Low](All_Time_Low "wikilink").

## Global perspectives

The punk subculture has spread to many countries around the world. The
fluidity of musical expression in particular makes it an ideal medium
for this cross-cultural interpretation.[106]

### Mexico

In Mexico, punk culture is primarily a phenomenon among middle and lower
class youth, many of whom were first exposed to punk music through
travel to England.[107] Because of low fees at public universities in
Mexico, a significant minority of Mexican punks are university
students.[108] It is estimated approximately 5,000 young people are
active punks in Mexico City, hosting two or three underground shows a
week.[109] These young people often form chavos banda—youth gangs—that
organise subculture activity by creating formal meeting spaces and
rituals and practices.[110]

Oral nicknames are a distinguishing feature of Mexican punk, where the
tradition of oral culture has influenced the development of nicknames
for almost all Mexican punks. Patches are widely used as an inexpensive
way to alter clothing and express identity. Though English language
bands like the [Dead Kennedys](Dead_Kennedys "wikilink") are well known
in Mexico, punks there prefer Spanish-language music or covers
translated into Spanish. The slam dance style common in the California
punk scene of the early 1980s is in the 2010s very popular.[111]

Performance practices reflect socio-economic circumstances of Mexican
punks. Called *tocadas*, shows are generally held in public spaces like
basketball courts or community centers instead of places of business
like bars and restaurants, as is more common in the United States and
Europe. They usually take place in the afternoon and end early to
accommodate the three or four hours it takes many punks to return home
by public transit. Mexican punk groups rarely release vinyl or CD
recordings, preferring cassettes.[112]

Though Mexican punk itself does not have an explicit political agenda,
Mexican punks have been active in the
[Zapatista](Zapatistas_(Mexican_Revolution) "wikilink"),
[Anarcho-punk](Anarcho-punk "wikilink"),[113] and
[Anti-globalisation](Anti-globalization_movement "wikilink")
movements.[114]

### Russia and the Soviet Union

The anti-establishment punk sub-culture has appealed to Russians for
decades, with punk media, fashion, and albums becoming enormously
popular underground items in the late 1970s onwards. Musically, the
sound of punk rock became a clear protest against the
[disco](disco "wikilink") influenced, heavily electronic official Soviet
regime songs. The government suppressed punks and ruthlessly censored
their music.

The founder of [Russian](Russia "wikilink") punk is considered to be
[Yegor Letov](Yegor_Letov "wikilink") with his band [Grazhdanskaya
Oborona](Grazhdanskaya_Oborona "wikilink"), which started performing in
the early 80's. Letov also invented a word chanted by punk fans during
concerts, Hoi (a mixture of the [Oi!](Oi! "wikilink") movement and the
[Russian profanity word](Russian_profanity_word "wikilink") Hui
(literally *penis*).

In the late 80's [Sektor Gaza](Sektor_Gaza "wikilink") formed, reaching
[cult status](cult_status "wikilink"). They created a genre called
"[Kolkhoz](Kolkhoz "wikilink") punk", which mixed elements from village
life into [punk music](punk_music "wikilink"). Another
[cult](cult "wikilink") band which started a few years later was [Korol
i Shut](Korol_i_Shut "wikilink"), introducing [horror
punk](horror_punk "wikilink"), using costumes and lyrics in the form of
tales and fables. [Korol i Shut](Korol_i_Shut "wikilink") became one of
the best selling and most highly regarded bands in the history of
[russian Rock](russian_Rock "wikilink").

### South Africa

Punk arrived slowly in South Africa during the 1970s when waves of
British tradesman welcomed by the
then-[apartheid](Apartheid_in_South_Africa "wikilink") government
brought cultural influences like the popular British music magazine
*[NME](NME "wikilink")*,[115] sold in South Africa six weeks after
publication.[116]

South African punk developed separately in
[Johannesburg](Johannesburg "wikilink"), [Durban](Durban "wikilink"),
and [Cape Town](Cape_Town "wikilink") and relied on live performances in
[townships](Township_(South_Africa) "wikilink") and streets as the
multi-racial composition of bands and fan bases challenged the legal and
social conventions of the apartheid regime.[117]

Political participation is foundational to punk subculture in South
Africa. During the apartheid regime, punk was second only to [Rock
music](Rock_music "wikilink") in its importance to multi-racial
interactions in South Africa.[118] Because of this, any involvement in
the punk scene was in itself a political statement. Police harassment
was common and the government often censored explicitly political
lyrics. Johannesburg based band [National
Wake](National_Wake "wikilink") was routinely censored and even banned
for songs like "International News," which challenged the South African
government's refusal to acknowledge the racial and political conflict in
the country.[119] National Wake guitarist Ivan Kadey attributes the punk
scene's ability to persevere despite the legal challenges of
multi-racial mixing to punk subculture's [DIY
ethic](DIY_ethic "wikilink") and
[anti-establishment](anti-establishment "wikilink") attitude.[120]

In post-apartheid South Africa, punk has attracted a greater number of
white middle-class males than the more diverse makeup of the subculture
during the apartheid era. [Thabo Mbeki](Thabo_Mbeki "wikilink")'s
[African Renaissance](African_Renaissance "wikilink") movement has
complicated the position of white South Africans in contemporary
society. Punk provides young white men the opportunity to explore and
express their minority identity.[121] Cape Town band [Hog Hoggidy
Hog](Hog_Hoggidy_Hog "wikilink") sings of the strange status of white
Africans:


''It's my home it's where I'll stay and where I belong,

*I didn't choose to be here I was born I might seem out of place*

*but everything I hold dear is under the African sun.*[122]

Post-apartheid punk subculture continues to be active in South African
politics, organising a 2000 festival called Punks Against Racism at
Thrashers Statepark in [Pretoria](Pretoria "wikilink"). Rather than the
sense of despondency and fatalism that characterised 1970s British punk
subculture, the politically engaged South African scene is more positive
about the future of South Africa.[123]

### Peru

In Peru punk traces its roots to the band [Los
Saicos](Los_Saicos "wikilink"), a Lima group that played the unique
blend of garage and break dance music that would later be labeled punk
as early as the 1960s. The early activity of Los Saicos has led many to
claim that punk originated in Lima instead of the UK, as it typically
assumed.[124] Though their claim to be the first punk band in the world
can be disputed, Los Saicos were undoubtedly the first in Latin America
and released their first single in 1965.[125][126] The group played to
full houses and made frequent television appearances throughout the
1960s. Throughout the 1970s, the band was completely forgotten. Years
later, a plaque that declares "here the global punk-rock movement was
born" was placed at the corner of Miguel Iglesias and Julio C. Tello
Streets in Lima.[127]

By the 1980s the punk scene in Peru was highly active. Peruvian punks
call themselves *subtes* and appropriate the subversive implications of
the English term "underground" through the Spanish term *subterraneo*
(literally, subterranean).[128] In the 1980s and 1990s subtes made
almost exclusive use of cassette recording as a means of circulating
music without participating in formal intellectual property and musical
production industries. The current scene relies on digital distribution
and assumes similar anti-establishment practices.[129] Like many punk
subcultures, subtes explicitly oppose the Peruvian state and advocate
instead an anarchic resistance that challenges the political and
mainstream cultural establishment.

### Brazil

The origins of punk rock in [Brazil](Brazil "wikilink") go back to the
late 1970s, as in most other countries mainly under the influence of the
[Sex Pistols](Sex_Pistols "wikilink"), [The Clash](The_Clash "wikilink")
and [The Ramones](The_Ramones "wikilink"). However, [particularly in São
Paulo](http://vivavivamovie.com), more obscure names like Dutch band
[Speed Twins](Speed_Twins "wikilink"), as well as earlier protopunk
artists such as [MC5](MC5 "wikilink"), [The
Stooges](The_Stooges "wikilink") and [The New York
Dolls](The_New_York_Dolls "wikilink") also had a big initial impact.

Brazilian punk emerged in part from the ideals of the musician Douglas
Viscaino, who, imbued with the pioneering ideas and unity of young
people that fought against the Brazilian military regime, formed a band
of protest called: Restos de Nada (Remnants of Nothing). Their musicians
already had their punk ideals before 1978.

Then came AI-5 and N.A.I. (later known as Condutores de Cadáver, "corpse
riders") in São Paulo, as well as Carne Podre ("rotten flesh") in
Curitiba (the capital of Paraná State), and Aborto Elétrico ("electric
miscarriage") in Brasília (the national capital).

Before punk proper bands emerged, two relatively famous glam and hard
rock bands, Joelho de Porco (literally "pig knee") and Made in Brazil,
used elements of the punk aesthetic around 1977 or 1978, and were called
punk bands by the media without really playing punk rock music or
defining themselves as such. Both bands, however, were important to the
pre-punk context of the 1970s that offered few alternatives to the
[Música popular brasileira](Música_popular_brasileira "wikilink") (MPB)
and [progressive rock](progressive_rock "wikilink") artists that
dominated the Brazilian music scene at the time. Joelho de Porco's
lyrics dealing with São Paulo's urban reality was also influential.

### Indonesia

In the late 2000s, punk rock faced harsh criticism in
[Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink")'s province of [Aceh](Aceh "wikilink").
Punk rock is seen as a threat to Islamic values and, according to
authorities, conflicts with [Shariah law](Shariah_law "wikilink").[130]

### Canada

The emergence of punk rock in Canada followed roughly the timelines of
both the UK and the US, and was at first confined to Canada's largest
cities. Since the mid-1980s, Canada's punk scene has spread over the
entire country, including small rural towns and villages.

In 1978, [Vancouver](Vancouver "wikilink") had a fledgling punk scene,
with such bands as [D.O.A.](D.O.A._(band) "wikilink"), [Pointed
Sticks](Pointed_Sticks "wikilink"), and [The Subhumans (Canadian
band)](The_Subhumans_(Canadian_band) "wikilink").

[Edmonton](Edmonton "wikilink")'s [SNFU](SNFU "wikilink") formed in
1981. They relocated to Vancouver in 1991 where, as of 2017, they were
still active.

Gerry "Useless" Hannah of The Subhumans received a ten-year prison
sentence (of which he served five years) for his involvement in the
*[Direct Action](Squamish_Five "wikilink")* urban guerrilla cell, also
known as the *Vancouver five* and the *Squamish five*, which executed a
series of attacks on civil infrastructure in BC and Ontario.

[12] Bangs, Lester. *Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung.* Anchor
Books, a division of Random House. 2003. pg. 8, 56, 57, 61, 64, 101:
reprints of articles which appeared in 1971 and 1972, that refer to
garage bands such as the Count Five and the Troggs as "punk"; pg. 101
associates "Iggy" and "Jonathan of Modern Lovers" with the Troggs and
their ilk (as being punk); pg. 112-113 speak of the Guess Who as
"punk"--[The Guess Who](The_Guess_Who "wikilink") had made recordings
(i.e. their hit version of Shakin' All Over," 1965) as a garage rock
outfit in the mid 60s; pg. 8 makes a general statement about "punk rock"
(garage) as a genre: "...then punk bands started cropping up who were
writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it
to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter...oh, it was beautiful, it was
pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best
days ever."; pg. 225 is a reprint from article which appeared in
late-70s, that refers back to garage bands as "punk"

[13] Laing, Dave. *One Chord Wonders: Power and Meaning in Punk Rock.*
PM Press. Oakland, CA 2015, 1984. pg. 22-23 - Laing writes that the
term, "punk rock" was used "generically" (i.e. as to designate a genre)
in the early 70s to describe mid-60s garage rock bands —he quotes Greg
Shaw from the late 70s referring to how it was used in the early 70s to
designate the genre: "Punk rock in those days was a quaint fanzine term
for a transient form of mid-60s music..."

1971--from a review of live show by ? & the Mysterions - Marsh refers to
their style as "a landmark exposition of punk rock."; \>Christgau,
Robert. *Village Voice.* October, 1971 - refers to "mid-60's garage rock
as "punk" \>Shaw, Greg. *Who Put the Bomp.* 1971. - In 1971 article in
*[Who Put the Bomp](Bomp! "wikilink")*, [Greg
Shaw](Greg_Shaw "wikilink") wrote about "...what I have chosen to call
'punk rock' bands—white teenage hard rock of '64-66
([Standells](Standells "wikilink"), Kingsmen, [Shadows of
Knight](Shadows_of_Knight "wikilink"), etc.)"

[14] Kaye, Lenny. "Headed, Decked, and Stroked..."--original liner notes
for *Nuggets* LP. (Elektra, 1972): uses the term "punk rock" to describe
whole genre of 60s garage bands: "..the name that has been unofficially
coined for them - "punk rock" - seems particularly fitting in this
case..." \>Shaw, Greg. *Rolling Stone,* Jan. 4, 1973 - review of
original *Nuggets* LP: speaks of whole phenomenon of 60s garage bands as
an actual genre called "punk rock": "Punk rock at its best is the
closest we came in the 60's to the original rockabilly spirit of Rock 'n
Roll..."
