**Rockers**, **leather boys**,[1] **Ton-up boys**,[2] and possibly
**café racers**[3][4][5] are members of a
[biker](motorcycling "wikilink") [subculture](subculture "wikilink")
that originated in the United Kingdom during the 1950s. It was mainly
centred on British [café racer](café_racer "wikilink")
[motorcycles](motorcycle "wikilink") and [rock 'n'
roll](rock_'n'_roll "wikilink") music. By 1965, the term *greaser* had
also been introduced to [Great
Britain](Great_Britain "wikilink")[6][7][8] and, since then, the terms
*greaser* and *rocker* have become synonymous within the British Isles
although used differently in North America and elsewhere. Rockers were
also derisively known as *Coffee Bar Cowboys*.[9] Their Japanese
counterpart was called the *Kaminari-Zoku* (*Thunder Tribe/Clan/Group*,
or *Thunderers*).[10]

## Origins

![](Busy-Bee-rockers.jpg "fig:Busy-Bee-rockers.jpg"), England, UK\]\]
Until the [post-war](post-war "wikilink") period, motorcycling held a
prestigious position and enjoyed a positive image in British society,
being associated with wealth and glamour. Starting in the 1950s, the
[middle classes](middle_class "wikilink") were able to buy inexpensive
motorcars so that motorcycles became transport for the poor.[11]

The rocker subculture came about due to factors such as: the end of
post-war rationing in the UK, a general rise in prosperity for [working
class](working_class "wikilink") youths, the recent availability of
[credit](Credit_(finance) "wikilink") and financing for young people,
the influence of American popular music and films, the construction of
race track-like arterial roads around British cities, the development of
transport cafes and a peak in British motorcycle engineering. The name
"rocker" came not from music, but from the rockers found in 4-stroke
engines, as opposed to the two stroke engines used by scooters and
ridden by mods.

During the 1950s,[12] they were known as "Ton-Up boys" because *doing a
[ton](Ton#Informal_tons "wikilink")* is English slang for driving at a
speed of or over. The [Teddy Boys](Teddy_Boy "wikilink") were considered
their "spiritual ancestors".[13] The rockers or ton-up boys took what
was essentially a sport and turned it into a lifestyle, dropping out of
mainstream society[14] and "rebelling at the points where their will
crossed society's".[15] This damaged the public image of motorcycling in
the UK and led to the politicisation of the motorcycling community.[16]

The mass media started targeting these socially powerless youths and
cast them as "folk devils", creating a [moral
panic](moral_panic "wikilink")[17] through highly exaggerated and
ill-founded portrayals.[18][19] From the 1960s on, due to the media fury
surrounding the [mods and rockers](mods_and_rockers "wikilink"),
motorcycling youths became more commonly known as *rockers*, a term
previously little known outside small groups.[20] The public came to
consider rockers as hopelessly naive, loutish, scruffy, motorized
cowboys, loners or outsiders.[21]

The Rocker subculture was associated with 1950s and early-1960s [rock
and roll](rock_and_roll "wikilink") music by artists such as [Gene
Vincent](Gene_Vincent "wikilink"), [Eddie
Cochran](Eddie_Cochran "wikilink") and [Chuck
Berry](Chuck_Berry "wikilink"), music that [George
Melly](George_Melly "wikilink") called "screw and smash" music.[22]

## Café racers

![](Triton_Peter_Ritzen.jpg "fig:Triton_Peter_Ritzen.jpg") motorcycle
consisting of a [Triumph](Triumph_Engineering_Co_Ltd "wikilink")
twin-cylinder engine in a [Norton](Norton_Motorcycle_Company "wikilink")
[Featherbed frame](Featherbed_frame "wikilink") built in a street legal
racer style with single seat, [clip-on](clip-ons "wikilink") low
handlebars and megaphone exhausts\]\] The term *[café
racer](café_racer "wikilink")* originated in the 1950s,[23] when bikers
often frequented [transport cafés](Truck_stop "wikilink"), using them as
starting and finishing points for road races. A café racer is a
motorcycle that has been modified for speed and good handling rather
than for comfort.[24] Features include: a single racing seat, low
handlebars (such as ace bars or one-sided clip-ons mounted directly onto
the front forks for control and aerodynamics), large racing
[petrol](petrol "wikilink") tanks (aluminium ones were often polished
and left unpainted), swept-back exhaust pipes, rear-set footpegs (to
give better clearance while cornering at high speeds) with or without
half or full race fairings.[25]

These motorcycles were lean, light and handled various road surfaces
well. The most defining machine of the rocker heyday was the
[Triton](Triton_motorcycle "wikilink"), which was a custom motorcycle
made of a [Norton](Norton_Motorcycle_Company "wikilink") [Featherbed
frame](Featherbed_frame "wikilink") and a [Triumph
Bonneville](Triumph_Bonneville "wikilink") engine. It used the most
common and fastest racing engine combined with the best handling frame
of its day.[26][27] Other popular motorcycle brands included
[BSA](Birmingham_Small_Arms_Company "wikilink"), [Royal
Enfield](Royal_Enfield "wikilink") and
[Matchless](Matchless "wikilink").

The term *café racers* is now also used to describe motorcycle riders
who prefer vintage British, Italian or Japanese motorbikes from the
1950s to late 1970s. These modern café racers do not resemble the
rockers of earlier decades, and they dress in a more modern and
comfortable style, with only a hint of likeness to the rocker style, nor
do they share the passion for 50s rock'n'roll. These modern café racers
have taken elements of the American greaser, British rocker, and modern
motorcycle rider styles to create a look of their own.[28][29] Rockers
in the 2000s tend still to ride classic British motorcycles, however,
classically styled European café racers are now also seen, such as [Moto
Guzzi](Moto_Guzzi "wikilink") or [Ducati](Ducati "wikilink"), as well as
classic Japanese bikes, some with British-made frames such as those made
by [Rickman](Rickman_Motorcycles "wikilink").

## Characteristics

![](Aviakit_Pudding_basin_helmet.jpg "fig:Aviakit_Pudding_basin_helmet.jpg")
Pudding basin helmet\]\] Rockers bought standard factory-made
motorcycles and stripped them down, tuning them up and modifying them to
appear like racing bikes. Their bikes were not merely transport, but
were used as an object of intimidation and masculinity projecting them
uneasily close to death,[30] an element exaggerated by their use of
skull and crossbone-type symbolism.

First seen in the United States and then England,[31] the rocker fashion
style was born out of necessity and practicality. Rockers wore heavily
decorated leather motorcycle jackets, often adorned with metal studs,
patches, pin badges and sometimes an [Esso](Esso "wikilink") *gas man*
trinket. When they rode their motorcycles, they usually wore no
[helmet](helmet "wikilink"), or wore a classic open-face helmet, aviator
goggles and a white silk scarf (to protect them from the elements).
Other common items included: T-shirts, leather caps,
[Levi's](Levi's "wikilink") or [Wrangler](Wrangler_(jeans) "wikilink")
[jeans](jeans "wikilink"),[32] leather trousers, tall motorcycle boots
(often made by [Lewis Leathers](Lewis_Leathers "wikilink") and Goldtop)
or [brothel creepers/beetle crushers](brothel_creeper "wikilink"). Also
popular was a patch declaring membership of the [59
Club](59_Club "wikilink") of England, a church-based youth organization
that later formed into a [motorcycle club](motorcycle_club "wikilink")
with members all over the world. The rocker hairstyle, kept in place
with [Brylcreem](Brylcreem "wikilink"), was usually a tame or
exaggerated [pompadour](Pompadour_(hairstyle) "wikilink") hairstyle, as
was popular with some 1950s [rock and roll](rock_and_roll "wikilink")
musicians.

![](Customised_Lewis_Leathers_Rockers.JPG "fig:Customised_Lewis_Leathers_Rockers.JPG")
motorcycle jacket with [Ace Cafe](Ace_Cafe_London "wikilink")
details\]\] Largely due to their clothing styles and dirtiness, the
rockers were not widely welcomed by venues such as pubs and dance halls.
Rockers also transformed rock and roll dancing into a more violent,
individualistic form beyond the control of dance hall management.[33]
They were generally reviled by the British motorcycle industry and
general enthusiasts as being as an embarrassment and bad for the
industry and the sport.[34]

Originally, many rockers opposed [recreational drug
use](recreational_drug_use "wikilink"), according to Johnny Stuart in
1987:

> They had no knowledge of the different sorts of drugs. To them
> amphetamines, cannabis, heroin were all drugs - something to be hated.
> Their ritual hatred of Mods and other sub-cultures was based in part
> on the fact that these people were believed to take drugs and were
> therefore regarded as sissies. Their dislike of anyone connected with
> drugs was intense.[35]

## Cultural legacy

factory, UK\]\] The rockers' look and attitude influenced pop groups in
the 1960s, such as [The Beatles](The_Beatles "wikilink"),[36] as well as
[hard rock](hard_rock "wikilink") and [punk rock](punk_rock "wikilink")
bands and fans in the late 1970s. The look of the ton-up boy and rocker
was accurately portrayed in the 1964 film *The Leather Boys*. The rocker
subculture has also influenced the [rockabilly](rockabilly "wikilink")
revival and the [psychobilly](psychobilly "wikilink") subculture.

Many contemporary rockers still wear [engineer
boots](engineer_boot "wikilink") or full-length motorcycle boots, but
[Winklepickers](Winklepickers "wikilink") (sharp pointed shoes) are no
longer common. Some wear brothel creepers (originally worn by [Teddy
Boys](Teddy_Boys "wikilink")), or [combat
boots](combat_boot "wikilink"). Rockers have continued to wear leather
motorcycle jackets, often adorned with patches, studs, spikes and
painted artwork; jeans or leather trousers; and white silk scarves.
Leather caps adorned with metal studs and chains, common among rockers
in the 1950s and 1960s, are rarely seen any more. Instead, some
contemporary rockers wear a classic woollen [flat
cap](flat_cap "wikilink").

## Rocker reunions

In the early 1970s, the British rocker and hardcore motorcycle scene
fractured and evolved under new influences coming from California: the
[hippies](hippie "wikilink") and the [Hells
Angels](Hells_Angels "wikilink").[37] The remaining rockers became known
as greasers, and the scene had all but died out.

In the early 1980s, a Rockers revival was started by Lennie Paterson and
a handful of original rockers. Paterson organized rocker reunion dances
called *piss-ups*, which attracted individuals from as far as Europe.
The first rocker reunion motorcycle run of 30 classic British
motorcycles rode to Battersea. Following runs went to other destinations
with historic relevance to Rockers such as
[Brighton](Brighton "wikilink").

In 1994 Mark Wilsmore[38] and others organised the first [Ace Cafe
Reunion](Ace_Cafe "wikilink") to mark the 25th anniversary of the
closure of the famous transport cafe before going on to re-opening and
established a series of events.[39] These events now attract up to
40,000 motorcyclists.[40][41]
