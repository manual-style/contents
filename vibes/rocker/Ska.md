SKA}} **Ska** (; ) is a [music genre](/music_genre "wikilink") that
originated in [Jamaica](/Jamaica "wikilink") in the late 1950s and was
the precursor to [rocksteady](/rocksteady "wikilink") and
[reggae](/reggae "wikilink").[1] It combined elements of
[Caribbean](/Caribbean "wikilink") [mento](/mento "wikilink") and
[calypso](/Calypso_music "wikilink") with
[American](/United_States "wikilink") [jazz](/jazz "wikilink") and
[rhythm and blues](/rhythm_and_blues "wikilink"). Ska is characterized
by a [walking bass](/walking_bass "wikilink") line accented with rhythms
on the [off beat](/Off-beat_(music) "wikilink"). It was developed in
Jamaica in the 1960s when [Prince Buster](/Prince_Buster "wikilink"),
[Clement "Coxsone" Dodd](/Coxsone_Dodd "wikilink"), and [Duke
Reid](/Duke_Reid "wikilink") formed [sound
systems](/Reggae_sound_system "wikilink") to play American rhythm and
blues and then began recording their own songs.[2] In the early 1960s,
ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with
[British](/United_Kingdom "wikilink")
[mods](/mod_(subculture) "wikilink"). Later it became popular with many
[skinheads](/skinhead "wikilink").[3][4][5][6]

Music historians typically divide the history of ska into three periods:
the original Jamaican scene of the 1960s; the [2
Tone](/2_Tone_(music_genre) "wikilink") ska revival of the late 1970s in
Britain, which fused Jamaican ska rhythms and melodies with the faster
tempos and harder edge of [punk rock](/punk_rock "wikilink"); and third
wave ska, which involved bands from the UK, other European countries
(notably Germany), Australia, Japan, South America and the United
States, beginning in the 1980s and peaking in the 1990s.[7]

## Etymology

There are multiple theories about the origins of the word *ska*. [Ernest
Ranglin](/Ernest_Ranglin "wikilink") claimed that the term was coined by
musicians to refer to the "skat! skat! skat!" scratching guitar
strum.[8] Another explanation is that at a recording session in 1959
produced by [Coxsone Dodd](/Coxsone_Dodd "wikilink"), double bassist
[Cluett Johnson](/Cluett_Johnson "wikilink") instructed guitarist
Ranglin to "play like ska, ska, ska", although Ranglin has denied this,
stating "Clue couldn't tell me what to play!"[9] A further theory is
that it derives from Johnson's word *skavoovie*, with which he was known
to greet his friends.[10] [Jackie Mittoo](/Jackie_Mittoo "wikilink")
insisted that the musicians called the rhythm *Staya Staya*, and that it
was [Byron Lee](/Byron_Lee "wikilink") who introduced the term
"ska".[11] [Derrick Morgan](/Derrick_Morgan "wikilink") said: "Guitar
and piano making a ska sound, like 'ska, ska,"[12]

## History

[thumb\|right\|350px\|Quarter note "[skank](skank_(guitar) "wikilink")"
guitar rhythm,[13] named [onomatopoetically](/onomatopoeia "wikilink")
for its sound. ](/File:Backbeat_chop.png "wikilink")
[thumb\|right\|350px\|Eighth note skank rhythm.[14]
](/File:Ska-Rock_Steady_on_D_and_Em64.png "wikilink") After [World War
II](/World_War_II "wikilink"), [Jamaicans](/Jamaicans "wikilink")
purchased radios in increasing numbers and were able to hear [rhythm and
blues](/rhythm_and_blues "wikilink") music from the [Southern United
States](/Southern_United_States "wikilink") in cities such as [New
Orleans](/New_Orleans "wikilink") by artists such as [Fats
Domino](/Fats_Domino "wikilink"), [Barbie
Gaye](/Barbie_Gaye "wikilink"), [Rosco Gordon](/Rosco_Gordon "wikilink")
and [Louis Jordan](/Louis_Jordan "wikilink")[15] whose early recordings
all contain the seeds of the "behind-the-beat" feel of ska and
reggae.[16] Domino's rhythm, accentuating the offbeat as in the song
"[Be My Guest](/Be_My_Guest_(Fats_Domino_song) "wikilink")", was a
particular influence.[17] The stationing of American military forces
during and after the war meant that Jamaicans could listen to military
broadcasts of American music, and there was a constant influx of records
from the United States. To meet the demand for that music, entrepreneurs
such as [Prince Buster](/Prince_Buster "wikilink"), [Coxsone
Dodd](/Coxsone_Dodd "wikilink"), and [Duke Reid](/Duke_Reid "wikilink")
formed [sound systems](/Reggae_sound_system "wikilink").

As the supply of previously unheard tunes in the [jump
blues](/jump_blues "wikilink") and more traditional R&B genres began to
dry up in the late 1950s, Jamaican producers began recording their own
version of the genres with local artists.[18] These recordings were
initially made to be played on "soft wax" (a lacquer on metal disc
acetate later to become known as a "dub plate"), but as demand for them
grew eventually some time in the second half of 1959 (believed by most
to be in the last quarter) producers such as Coxsone Dodd and Duke Reid
began to issue these recording on 45rpm 7-inch discs. At this point the
style was a direct copy of the American "shuffle blues" style, but
within two or three years it had morphed into the more familiar ska
style with the off-beat guitar chop that could be heard in some of the
more uptempo late-1950s American rhythm and blues recordings such as
Domino's "Be My Guest" and Barbie Gaye's "[My Boy
Lollypop](/My_Boy_Lollypop "wikilink")", both of which were popular on
Jamaican [sound systems](/Sound_system_(Jamaican) "wikilink") of the
late 1950s.[19] This "classic" ska style was of bars made up of four
triplets but was characterized by a [guitar
chop](/guitar_chop "wikilink") on the [off
beat](/Off-beat_(music) "wikilink")—known as an upstroke or 'skank'—with
horns taking the lead and often following the off-beat skank and piano
emphasizing the bass line and, again, playing the skank.[20] Drums kept
[ time](/4/4_time "wikilink") and the bass drum was accented on the
third beat of each four-triplet phrase. The snare would play side stick
and accent the third beat of each 4-triplet phrase.[21] The upstroke
sound can also be found in other [Caribbean](/Caribbean "wikilink")
forms of music, such as [mento](/mento "wikilink") and
[calypso](/Calypso_music "wikilink").[22] [Ernest
Ranglin](/Ernest_Ranglin "wikilink") asserted that the difference
between R&B and ska beats is that the former goes "*chink*-ka" and the
latter goes "ka-*chink*".[23]

One theory about the origin of ska is that Prince Buster created it
during the inaugural recording session for his new record label Wild
Bells.[24] The session was financed by Duke Reid, who was supposed to
get half of the songs to release. The guitar began emphasizing the
second and fourth beats in the bar, giving rise to the new sound. The
drums were taken from traditional Jamaican drumming and marching styles.
To create the ska beat, Prince Buster essentially flipped the R&B
shuffle beat, stressing the offbeats with the help of the guitar. Prince
Buster has explicitly cited American rhythm and blues as the origin of
ska: specifically, [Willis
Jackson](/Willis_Jackson_(saxophonist) "wikilink")'s song "Later for the
Gator" (which was Coxsone Dodd's number one selection), and Duke Reid's
number-one spin "Hey Hey Mr. Berry", to this day by an unidentified
artist and with this given title (in the way Northern Soul DJs used to
cover up the identity of records to prevent other DJs from finding
copies), the joke amongst surviving Jamaican soundmen who were there at
the time being that "This is the one Duke took to the grave with
him".[25]

The first ska recordings were created at facilities such as [Federal
Records](/Ken_Khouri "wikilink"), [Studio
One](/Studio_One_(record_label) "wikilink") and WIRL Records in
[Kingston, Jamaica](/Kingston,_Jamaica "wikilink") with producers such
as Dodd, Reid, Prince Buster, and [Edward
Seaga](/Edward_Seaga "wikilink").[26] The ska sound coincided with the
celebratory feelings surrounding Jamaica's independence from the UK in
1962; an event commemorated by songs such as [Derrick
Morgan](/Derrick_Morgan "wikilink")'s "Forward March" and [The
Skatalites](/The_Skatalites "wikilink")' "Freedom Sound".

Until Jamaica ratified the [Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic
Works](/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works "wikilink"),
the country did not honor international music
[copyright](/copyright "wikilink") protection. This created many cover
songs and reinterpretations. One such cover was [Millie
Small](/Millie_Small "wikilink")'s version of the R&B/shuffle tune, "My
Boy Lollypop", first recorded in New York in 1956 by 14-year-old Barbie
Gaye.[27][28] Smalls' rhythmically similar version, released in 1964,
was Jamaica's first commercially successful international hit. With over
seven million copies sold, it remains one of the best selling reggae/ska
songs of all time. Many other Jamaican artists would have success
recording instrumental ska versions of popular American and British
music, such as [Beatles](/The_Beatles "wikilink") songs,
[Motown](/Motown "wikilink") and
[Atlantic](/Atlantic_records "wikilink") [soul](/soul_music "wikilink")
hits, movie theme songs and [surf rock](/surf_rock "wikilink")
instrumentals. [The Wailers](/The_Wailers_(1963–1974_band) "wikilink")
covered the Beatles' "[And I Love Her](/And_I_Love_Her "wikilink")", and
radically reinterpreted [Bob Dylan](/Bob_Dylan "wikilink")'s "[Like a
Rolling Stone](/Like_a_Rolling_Stone "wikilink")". They also created
their own versions of Latin-influenced music from artists such as [Mongo
Santamaría](/Mongo_Santamaría "wikilink").[29]

[Byron Lee & the Dragonaires](/Byron_Lee_&_the_Dragonaires "wikilink")
performed ska with Prince Buster, [Eric "Monty"
Morris](/Eric_"Monty"_Morris "wikilink"), and [Jimmy
Cliff](/Jimmy_Cliff "wikilink") at the [1964 New York World's
Fair](/1964_New_York_World's_Fair "wikilink"). As music changed in the
United States, so did ska. In 1965 and 1966, when American soul music
became slower and smoother, ska changed its sound accordingly and
evolved into [rocksteady](/rocksteady "wikilink").[30][31] However,
rocksteady's heyday was brief, peaking in 1967. By 1968, ska evolved
again into reggae.

### 2 Tone

[thumb\|The Specials](/File:The_Specials.JPG "wikilink") The [2
Tone](/2_Tone_(music_genre) "wikilink") genre, which began in the late
1970s in the [Coventry](/Coventry "wikilink") area of
[England](/England "wikilink"), was a fusion of Jamaican ska rhythms and
melodies with [punk rock](/punk_rock "wikilink")'s more aggressive
guitar chords and lyrics.[32] Compared to 1960s ska, 2 Tone music had
faster tempos, fuller instrumentation, and a harder edge. The genre was
named after [2 Tone Records](/2_Tone_Records "wikilink"), a record label
founded by [Jerry Dammers](/Jerry_Dammers "wikilink") of [The
Specials](/The_Specials "wikilink"). In many cases, the reworking of
classic ska songs turned the originals into hits again in the [United
Kingdom](/United_Kingdom "wikilink").

The 2 Tone movement promoted racial unity at a time when racial tensions
were high in the UK. There were many Specials songs that raised
awareness of the issues of racism, fighting and friendship issues. Riots
in British cities were a feature during the summer that The Specials
song "Ghost Town" was a hit, although this work was in a slower, reggae
beat. Most of the 2 Tone bands had multiracial lineups, such as [The
Beat](/The_Beat_(British_band) "wikilink") (known as The English Beat in
[North America](/North_America "wikilink") and the British Beat in
[Australia](/Australia "wikilink")), The Specials, and [The
Selecter](/The_Selecter "wikilink").[33] Although only on the 2 Tone
label for one single, [Madness](/Madness_(band) "wikilink") was one of
the most effective bands at bringing the 2 Tone genre into the
mainstream. The music of this era resonated with white working class
youth and West Indian immigrants who experienced the struggles addressed
in the lyrics.[34]

### Third wave

Third wave ska originated in the punk scene in the late 1980s and became
commercially successful in the 1990s. Although some third wave ska has a
traditional 1960s sound, most third wave ska is characterized by
dominating guitar riffs and large horn sections. Examples of third wave
ska bands include [The Toasters](/The_Toasters "wikilink"),
[Fishbone](/Fishbone "wikilink"), [The Mighty Mighty
Bosstones](/The_Mighty_Mighty_Bosstones "wikilink"), [The
Hotknives](/The_Hotknives "wikilink"),
[Hepcat](/Hepcat_(band) "wikilink"), [The
Slackers](/The_Slackers "wikilink"), [Suicide
Machines](/Suicide_Machines "wikilink"), [Voodoo Glow
Skulls](/Voodoo_Glow_Skulls "wikilink"), [Reel Big
Fish](/Reel_Big_Fish "wikilink"), [Less Than
Jake](/Less_Than_Jake "wikilink"), [Bim Skala
Bim](/Bim_Skala_Bim "wikilink"), [Mad Caddies](/Mad_Caddies "wikilink"),
[The Aquabats](/The_Aquabats "wikilink"), [Mustard
Plug](/Mustard_Plug "wikilink"), [Five Iron
Frenzy](/Five_Iron_Frenzy "wikilink"),
[Buck-o-Nine](/Buck-o-Nine "wikilink"), [Suburban
Legends](/Suburban_Legends "wikilink"), [The
Pietasters](/The_Pietasters "wikilink"), [Save
Ferris](/Save_Ferris "wikilink"),
[Goldfinger](/Goldfinger_(band) "wikilink"), [Dance Hall
Crashers](/Dance_Hall_Crashers "wikilink"),
[Mephiskapheles](/Mephiskapheles "wikilink"), [Blue
Meanies](/Blue_Meanies_(Illinois_band) "wikilink") and [The O.C.
Supertones](/The_O.C._Supertones "wikilink"). New York City bands such
as The Second Step, the Connotations, The Third Degree and The Boilers
had a steady presence at [CBGB](/CBGB "wikilink") throughout the mid to
late 80s.

#### United Kingdom

By the late 1980s, ska had experienced a minor resurgence of popularity
in the United Kingdom, due to bands such as [The
Burial](/The_Burial "wikilink") and [The
Hotknives](/The_Hotknives "wikilink"), ska-friendly record labels such
as Unicorn Records, ska festivals, and a re-emergence of the
[traditional skinhead](/Trojan_skinhead "wikilink")
[subculture](/subculture "wikilink").[35][36][37][38][39]

#### Germany, Spain, Australia, Russia, Japan and Latin America

The early 1980s saw a massive surge in ska's popularity in
[Germany](/Germany "wikilink"), which led to the founding of many ska
bands like [The Busters](/The_Busters "wikilink"), record labels and
festivals.[40][41]

In [Spain](/Spain "wikilink"), ska became relevant in the 1980s in the
[Basque Country](/Southern_Basque_Country "wikilink") due to the
influence of [Basque Radical Rock](/Basque_Radical_Rock "wikilink"),
with [Kortatu](/Kortatu "wikilink") and Potato being the most
representatives bands. ([Skalariak](/Skalariak "wikilink") and
[Betagarri](/Betagarri "wikilink") followed their footsteps in the early
1990s and their influence is visible outside the Basque Country in
punk-rock bands like [Ska-P](/Ska-P "wikilink"),
[Boikot](/Boikot "wikilink") and many others that have gained importance
in the Spanish rock and punk rock scene and festivals.

The [Australian ska](/Australian_ska "wikilink") scene flourished in the
mid-1980s, following the musical precedents set by 2 Tone, and
spearheaded by bands such as Strange Tenants, No Nonsense and [The
Porkers](/The_Porkers "wikilink").[42] Some of the Australian ska
revival bands found success on the national music charts, most notably
[The Allniters](/Allniters "wikilink"), who had a #10 hit with a ska
cover of "[Montego Bay](/Montego_Bay_(song) "wikilink")" in 1983.[43]
The 30 piece [Melbourne Ska
Orchestra](/Melbourne_Ska_Orchestra "wikilink") has enjoyed great
success in recent years, touring internationally, including sets at
[Glastonbury](/Glastonbury_Festival "wikilink") and [Montreux Jazz
Festival](/Montreux_Jazz_Festival "wikilink").[44]

Russian (then-Soviet) ska scene established in the mid-1980s in [Saint
Petersburg](/Saint_Petersburg "wikilink") as the
[anglophone](/anglophone "wikilink") opposition to more traditional
[Russian rock](/Russian_rock "wikilink") music. [AVIA](/AVIA "wikilink")
and [N.O.M.](/N.O.M. "wikilink") were among the first bands of genre.
Then the bands like [Spitfire](/Spitfire_(Russian_band) "wikilink"),
[Distemper](/Distemper_(band) "wikilink"),
[Leningrad](/Leningrad_(band) "wikilink") and [Markscheider
Kunst](/Markscheider_Kunst "wikilink") began popular and commercially
successful in Russia and abroad in the late 1990s.

Japan established its own ska scene, colloquially referred to as
*[J-ska](/J-ska "wikilink")*, in the mid-1980s.[45][46] The [Tokyo Ska
Paradise Orchestra](/Tokyo_Ska_Paradise_Orchestra "wikilink"), formed in
1985, have been one of the most commercially successful progenitors of
Japanese ska.[47]

Latin America's ska scene started developing in the mid-1980s. Latin
American ska bands typically play traditional ska rhythms blended with
strong influences from Latin music and [rock en
Español](/rock_en_Español "wikilink").[48] The most prominent of these
bands is [Los Fabulosos Cadillacs](/Los_Fabulosos_Cadillacs "wikilink")
from [Argentina](/Argentina "wikilink"). Formed in 1985, the band has
sold millions of records worldwide, scoring an international hit single
with "[El Matador](/El_Matador "wikilink")" in 1994 and winning the 1998
[Grammy Award](/Grammy_Award "wikilink") for [Best Latin
Rock/Alternative
album](/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Latin_Rock/Alternative_Album "wikilink").[49]

#### United States

By the early 1980s, 2 Tone-influenced ska bands began forming throughout
the [United States](/United_States "wikilink").[50] [The
Uptones](/The_Uptones "wikilink") from [Berkeley,
California](/Berkeley,_California "wikilink") and [The
Toasters](/The_Toasters "wikilink") from [New York
City](/New_York_City "wikilink")—both formed in 1981 — were among the
first active ska bands in North America. They are both credited with
laying the groundwork for American ska and establishing scenes in their
respective regions.[51][52][53] In Los Angeles around the same time,
[The Untouchables](/The_Untouchables_(band) "wikilink") also formed.
While many of the early American ska bands continued in the musical
traditions set by 2 Tone and the [mod revival](/mod_revival "wikilink"),
bands such as [Fishbone](/Fishbone "wikilink"), [The Mighty Mighty
Bosstones](/The_Mighty_Mighty_Bosstones "wikilink") and [Operation
Ivy](/Operation_Ivy_(band) "wikilink") pioneered the American [ska
punk](/ska_punk "wikilink") subgenre, a
[fusion](/fusion_(music) "wikilink") of ska and [punk
rock](/punk_rock "wikilink") that typically downplayed ska's R&B
influence in favor of faster [tempos](/tempo "wikilink") and guitar
[distortion](/distortion_(music) "wikilink").[54][55]

Two hotspots for the United States' burgeoning ska scenes were New York
City and [Orange County](/Orange_County,_California "wikilink"),
California. In New York, Toasters frontman [Robert "Bucket"
Hingley](/Robert_"Bucket"_Hingley "wikilink") formed independent record
label [Moon Ska Records](/Moon_Ska_Records "wikilink") in 1983. The
label quickly became the largest independent ska label in the United
States.[56] The [Orange County ska](/Orange_County_ska "wikilink") scene
was a major breeding ground for ska punk and more contemporary
pop-influenced ska music, personified by bands such as [Reel Big
Fish](/Reel_Big_Fish "wikilink") and
[Sublime](/Sublime_(band) "wikilink").[57] It was here that the term
"third wave ska" was coined and popularized by Albino Brown and Tazy
Phyllipz (hosts of the *[Ska Parade](/Ska_Parade "wikilink")* radio
show) to describe the new wave of ska-influenced bands which were
steadily gaining notoriety; and Brown wrote the first treatise on ska's
third wave in 1994.[58][59][60] The [San Francisco Bay
Area](/San_Francisco_Bay_Area "wikilink") also contributed to ska's
growing popularity, with [Skankin' Pickle](/Skankin'_Pickle "wikilink"),
[Let's Go Bowling](/Let's_Go_Bowling "wikilink") and the [Dance Hall
Crashers](/Dance_Hall_Crashers "wikilink") becoming known on the touring
circuit.

The mid-1990s saw a considerable rise in ska music's underground
popularity, marked by the formation of many ska-based record labels,
booking organizations and indie [zines](/zine "wikilink"). While Moon
Ska was still the largest of the United States' ska labels, other
notable labels included Jump Up Records of
[Chicago](/Chicago "wikilink"), which covered the thriving
[midwest](/Midwestern_United_States "wikilink") scene, and Steady Beat
Recordings of [Los Angeles](/Los_Angeles "wikilink"), which covered
Southern California's traditional ska revival. [Stomp
Records](/Stomp_Records "wikilink") of [Montreal](/Montreal "wikilink")
was Canada's primary producer and distributor of ska music.[61]
Additionally, many punk and indie rock labels, such as [Hellcat
Records](/Hellcat_Records "wikilink") and [Fueled by
Ramen](/Fueled_by_Ramen "wikilink"), broadened their scope to include
both ska and ska punk bands. [Asian Man
Records](/Asian_Man_Records "wikilink") (formerly [Dill
Records](/Dill_Records "wikilink")), founded in 1996, started out
primarily releasing ska punk albums before branching out to other music
styles.[62]

In 1993, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones signed with [Mercury
Records](/Mercury_Records "wikilink"), becoming the first American ska
punk band to find mainstream commercial success, with their 1994 album
*[Question the Answers](/Question_the_Answers "wikilink")* achieving
[gold record](/RIAA_certification "wikilink") status and peaking at #138
on the [*Billboard* 200](/Billboard_200 "wikilink").[63] In 1995, punk
band [Rancid](/Rancid_(band) "wikilink"), featuring former members of
Operation Ivy, released the ska punk single "[Time
Bomb](/Time_Bomb_(Rancid_song) "wikilink")", which reached #8 on the
[*Billboard* Modern Rock Tracks](/Alternative_Songs "wikilink"),
becoming the first major ska punk hit of the 1990s and launching the
genre into the public eye.[64] Over the next few years, a string of
notable ska and ska-influenced singles became hits on mainstream radio,
including "[Sell Out](/Sell_Out_(Reel_Big_Fish_song) "wikilink")" by
Reel Big Fish and "[The Impression That I
Get](/The_Impression_That_I_Get "wikilink")" by The Mighty Mighty
Bosstones, all of whom would reach platinum status with each of their
respective albums. By 1996, third wave ska was one of the most popular
forms of alternative music in the United States.[65] A sign of
mainstream knowledge of third wave ska was the inclusion of the parody
song "Your Horoscope for Today" on ["Weird Al"
Yankovic](/"Weird_Al"_Yankovic "wikilink")'s 1999 album *[Running with
Scissors](/Running_with_Scissors_("Weird_Al"_Yankovic_album) "wikilink")*.

By the late 1990s, mainstream interest in third wave ska bands waned as
other music genres gained momentum.[66] Moon Ska Records folded in 2000,
but Moon Ska Europe, a licensed affiliate based in Europe, continued
operating in the 2000s and was later relaunched as [Moon Ska
World](/Moon_Ska_World "wikilink"). In 2003, Hingley launched a new ska
record label, [Megalith Records](/Megalith_Records "wikilink"). [Jump Up
Records](http://www.jumpuprecords.com), a label in Chicago, IL, also
releases new ska music. Jump Up Records has been in business for 25
years.
