**Wizard rock** (sometimes shortened as **Wrock**) is a genre of [rock
music](rock_music "wikilink") that developed between 2002 and 2004 in
the United States. Wizard rock bands are characterized by their
performances and humorous [novelty songs](novelty_songs "wikilink")
about the *[Harry Potter](Harry_Potter "wikilink")* universe.[1][2]
Wizard rock initially started in
[Massachusetts](Massachusetts "wikilink") with [Harry and the
Potters](Harry_and_the_Potters "wikilink"), though it has grown
internationally.[3][4]

## Characteristics

Leading bands in this genre include [Harry and the
Potters](Harry_and_the_Potters "wikilink") and [Draco and the
Malfoys](Draco_and_the_Malfoys "wikilink").[5] Although most listeners
of the genre are fans of *Harry Potter*, some bands have attracted
listeners outside of the books' fanbase.[6] Wizard rock songs are often
written from the point of view of a particular character in the books,
usually the character who features in the band's name. In contrast to
mainstream bands that have some songs incorporating literary references
among a wider repertoire of music (notably [Led
Zeppelin](Led_Zeppelin "wikilink") to *[The Lord of the
Rings](The_Lord_of_the_Rings "wikilink")*),[7] wizard rock bands take
their inspiration entirely from the *Harry Potter* universe.[8] When
performing live, wizard rock bands often [cosplay](cosplay "wikilink"),
or dress as, characters from the novels.[9] Some bands perform at fan
conventions.[10]

## History

![](Theparselmouthswrockstock.jpg "fig:Theparselmouthswrockstock.jpg")
in 2007, displaying the *Harry Potter* themed costumes common within the
genre.[11]\]\] The earliest Harry Potter-themed song is conventionally
traced to 2000 when the Los Angeles-based
[pop-punk](pop-punk "wikilink") band Switchblade Kittens released an
"Ode to Harry" from the perspective of [Ginny
Weasley](Ginny_Weasley "wikilink").[12][13] [Harry and the
Potters](Harry_and_the_Potters "wikilink") originated the Harry
Potter-themed band which became the genesis of a
[fandom](fandom "wikilink")-centered genre of music called wizard
rock.[14][15] As Harry and the Potters increased in popularity, other
wizard rock bands started to emerge. Brian Ross and Bradley Mehlenbacher
originally conceived [Draco and the
Malfoys](Draco_and_the_Malfoys "wikilink") as a parody of Harry and the
Potters, who were performing at a local house party. In April 2005, Matt
Maggiacomo invited Harry and the Potters to play at an all-Harry Potter
show at his Rhode Island home. That night, Maggiacomo made his debut as
*The Whomping Willows*, and his friends, Mehlenbacher and his brother,
Brian Ross, played for the first time as *Draco and the
Malfoys*.[16][17][18]

There are also festivals focused on the genre such as
[Wrockstock](Wrockstock "wikilink"), which was first held in 2007 in the
United States.[19][20]
