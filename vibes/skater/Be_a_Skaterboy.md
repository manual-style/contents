Skaters have a cool laid-back style, often rocking low-top kicks and
cool sweaters. Comfort is at a premium for skaters, who're always ready
to hop on their board and cruise around. You can learn to cultivate that
style by reading a few helpful tips after the
jump.![](Skater_Boy_7233.jpg "fig:Skater_Boy_7233.jpg")

## Steps

1.  Get the correct clothes. Wearing skater clothes is one of the most
    important parts of becoming a skaterboy. You will
    need:![](Be_a_Sk8R_Boi_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sk8R_Boi_Step_2.jpg")
    -   A nice pair of jeans (avoid sweat pants)
    -   A nice looking hoodie.
2.  Wear skate shoes. Other types of shoes don't have the skater look
    and become easily wrecked from riding a skateboard. Tie your shoes
    loosely or not at all. Your heel should slip out of the shoe
    slightly as you walk. However, make sure the shoes do not fall off
    when you are doing
    tricks.![](Be_a_Sk8R_Boi_Step_1Bullet1.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sk8R_Boi_Step_1Bullet1.jpg")
3.  Walk with a relaxed swagger.
4.  Get a skater hat. Wear it sideways, backwards or diagonally.

    wear a toque (as seen in the image in the description.)
5.  Grow long

6.  Acquire a skateboard. Practice riding it everyday. Master the
    perfect riding stance. Get good at just riding your board around
    before trying any
    tricks.![](Be_a_Sk8R_Boi_Step_3.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sk8R_Boi_Step_3.jpg")
7.  \*Take your skateboard with you everywhere you
    go.![](Be_a_Sk8R_Boi_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sk8R_Boi_Step_4.jpg")
8.  Get a hat. Beanies (hats) are important-If you have a long fringe
    either cover it up by putting your hat to your eyebrows or show it
    off by keeping your hat just sitting on your head-It works either
    way.![](Be_a_Sk8R_Boi_Step_6.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sk8R_Boi_Step_6.jpg")

## Tips

-   Never brag about something you never did. Doing so will get you a
    bad rep as a poser.
-   Here are some good brands to buy skater gear from:
    -   DC
    -   Volcom
    -   Etnies
    -   Hurley
    -   Supraif
    -   Fallen
    -   Element

## Warnings

-   Don't do this all in one day. You must make the transition subtle so
    you do not look like a poser. Try to drag the transition out for
    about thirty days. There is no point in taking any longer than that.
-   Don't skateboard in areas where it is prohibited. There's nothing
    wrong with skateboarding, but many people develop a misconception of
    the contrary due to skateboarders skating where they shouldn't.
