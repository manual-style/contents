Skater hair is usually curly and emo hair is pin straight. How do you
combine them when you like them both?

## Steps

1.  Shower and shampoo your hair
    thoroughly.![](Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_1.jpg "fig:Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Dry your hair completely with a little bit of damp but only with a
    towel.![](Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_2.jpg "fig:Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_2.jpg")
    -   Your hair should have bangs which are a little below the eyes
        when you pull it down, and halfway down your ears on the
        sides.![](690643_2_bullet1.jpg "fig:690643_2_bullet1.jpg")
3.  Flip your hair down and using a bit of Garnier leave in conditioner
    pull all the hair
    down.![](Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_3.jpg "fig:Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_3.jpg")
    -   Using your fingers your hair should be directly down toward
        gravity since your head is upside
        down.![](690643_3_bullet1.jpg "fig:690643_3_bullet1.jpg")
4.  Straighten all of the hair while it's in that
    position![](Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_4.jpg "fig:Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Straighten up and then shake your head hard side to
    side![](Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_5.jpg "fig:Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_5.jpg")
    -   It should settle but with a bit of a fan to the
        sides![](690643_5_bullet1.jpg "fig:690643_5_bullet1.jpg")
6.  If you flick your hair towards the right then take the left side of
    the hair and flatten it to the side of your
    head.![](Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_6.jpg "fig:Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Arrange your bangs so that they go a bit towards the direction of
    your
    flick.![](Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_7.jpg "fig:Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_7.jpg")
    -   If you have a right flick then the right side of the hair should
        remain fanned out (use some spray to secure
        that).![](690643_7_bullet1.jpg "fig:690643_7_bullet1.jpg")
8.  Flatten the back along your neck and you're
    done.![](Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_8.jpg "fig:Cross_Emo_and_Skater_Hair_Step_8.jpg")

## Tips
