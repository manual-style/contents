Everyone wants to look cute! But they also want to be comfortable so I'm
going to show you how to do both all at once!

## Steps

### Winter

1.  Layout the clothes the night before!In the morning when your running
    late the last thing you have time for is dressing nice! Most likely
    you will put on leggings and a hoodie and walk out the door! That's
    not a bad thing but if you want to be noticed them maybe not!
2.  set your alarm before you need to get up!i know what your thinking
    what does that have to do with clothes but if you do this then you
    will not be so rushed and have time to think about how to do your
    hair to go with the outfit that you are wearing!
3.  Keep warm!in winter remember to keep your clothes cosy! Yet try to
    make sure it's comfortable and cute as well!
4.  here's an example of an outfit!A plain top that's flowy, a comfy
    hoodie, some nice jeans, combat boots and some socks peaking out at
    the top!

### Summer

1.  Think about the weather!Is it 20 degrees or 45 outside! Don't go
    into school/work or the town in jeans and a jumper when you should
    be wearing a lovely dress or shorts and a cute top!
2.  think about the classics!Why not a cute skater dress with some
    sandals or shorts and a cute graphic tee with sneakers!
3.  Wear what makes you confident! That dress that makes you proud of
    your body! Or the shorts that make you think my legs are
    beautiful!Â You go girl!
