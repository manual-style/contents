Skater fashion is very popular, but a lot of the trendier stuff isn’t
ideal for most real skaters. While real skaters definitely care about
their looks and styles, they are most concerned with clothing that is
functional and practical for skateboarding. The most authentic skater
fashion incorporates both style and practicality.

## Steps

### Choosing Clothing for Comfort and Performance

1.  Choose pants that aren’t restrictive. Most skater styles emphasize
    very tight pants or very loose-fitting pants. Both of these look
    great, but they can hinder you when you’re trying to pull off a
    trick. Go for pants that are somewhere in
    between.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   If you really want to wear an extreme fit, make sure you road
        test them on your board before attempting to publicly pull off a
        trick in them.
    -   If you’re more interested in wearing skater styles and not
        actually skateboarding, choose the extreme fit that you like
        best.
2.  Wear low maintenance graphic t-shirts of all kinds. T-shirts are by
    far the most comfortable and popular shirts worn by skateboarders
    and they wear them in every fit imaginable, with the most popular
    being over-sized, basic and slim-fit. They are usually screen
    printed with a graphic design of some
    kind.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Thrasher t-shirts have always been iconic and still enjoy
        immense popularity today. However if you aren't a good
        skateboarder and can't do fairly decent tricks, you will get
        called a poser.[1]
    -   Thrasher t-shirts are manufactured by Thrasher skateboarding
        magazine and are typically very affordable, making them all the
        more popular.[2]
    -   Oversized hoodies that zip up look casual and they will keep you
        warm while fitting neatly into the classic skater style. Toss
        one on over your t-shirt.[3]
    -   Plaid flannels over t-shirts is another popular look.
3.  Wear flexible, flat-soled shoes with good grip. Skaters need lots of
    grip on their shoes to keep them on the board while performing
    tricks. Shoes also need to offer plenty of flexibility and
    flat-soles are a must. Wearing shoes without these key elements will
    not look
    authentic.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Don’t worry about keeping your shoes shiny and new looking. A
        real skater’s shoes will get ripped up and beaten up from use.
    -   Look for shoes made specifically for skateboarding. These will
        include all of the authentic-looking features and keep you on
        your board.
    -   You can’t go wrong with a classic skater brand like Vans. Choose
        versions that you can slip on. If you get Vans with laces, go
        for those with the fat laces that don’t actually require you to
        tie them.[4]
4.  Get a hairstyle that best suits your general style. Basic skater
    hairstyles vary widely, ranging from bowl cuts to mohawks. Tony
    Hawk's hairstyle, which is a New-Wave inspired short cut with long
    bangs in the front, is still one of the most recognizable skater
    hairstyles of all time and very
    popular.[5]![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Many skaters sport an alternative look with brightly dyed hair
        in colors like blue, red, and green.
    -   Dreads are a classic look, as well.
5.  Buy skate brands. Not just because they look cool, but get them
    because clothing made specifically for skateboarding will feature
    all of the authentic elements that a real skater
    needs.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_5.jpg")
    -   They offer skater style along with the practicality and
        functionality required to rock your board.
6.  Follow the pros. If you aren’t sure what skater style you like best,
    check out what the pro skateboarders are wearing. They usually have
    endorsements from skateboard brands, so they will publicly sport the
    newest fashions in whatever style they like
    best.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_6.jpg")
    -   If you see a pro who’s style you really like, try getting a few
        similar pieces and building your wardrobe from there.
    -   Reference skateboarding videos for additional ideas.
7.  Keep it simple. A real skater is most concerned with clothing that
    won’t get in the way of doing tricks and performing. Don’t overly
    concern yourself with trying to impress others. Go for a casual look
    that doesn’t give the impression of trying too
    hard.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_7.jpg")
    -   Skateboarding is an extreme sport and will be hard on your
        clothing. It looks normal and authentic to have ripped, stained
        and faded items.
    -   In skateboarding, clothing style is important. But it’s not more
        important than landing your tricks and honing your craft.

### Dressing in the Punk Style

1.  Wear skinny jeans. No skate punk is complete without tight-fitting
    skinny jeans, preferably in black. Look for brands that are made
    with elastic waists and offer some flexibility. If you can’t pull
    off your tricks or your feet are numb because your tight pants are
    preventing proper blood circulation, get something a little looser.
    Jeans are typically ripped or otherwise
    distressed.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_8.jpg")
    -   If super tight pants aren’t your thing, skate punks occasionally
        wear baggy, knee length shorts. Choose dark colors or black.
    -   The skater punk style takes its cues directly from the original
        punk style, which also favored black skinny jeans and other
        slim-fitting clothing.[6]
    -   Original punk style is far more documented than skater punk
        style, so you can reference clothing styles of original punk and
        adapt it as needed. The authenticity will shine through.
2.  Choose printed t-shirts with punk imagery. Look for the classic punk
    symbols, like skulls, or any other bold designs.[7] T-shirt colors
    are often neutral in color – black, white, or occasionally an
    aggressive
    red.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_9.jpg")
    -   Skate punk band t-shirts are also important to this style. A few
        classic options are Black Flag, Minor Threat, Suicidal
        Tendencies and JFA.[8]
    -   The DIY spirit of skate punk also applies to printed t-shirts.
        If you can’t find things that you like, try creating customized
        t-shirts with your own designs.[9]
    -   Regardless of what imagery you choose for your t-shirts, look
        for tight or slim-fitting versions.
3.  Wear Vans checkerboard slip-on shoes. These have been iconic skate
    punk shoes since the early '80s. They are made of tough canvas and
    feature padded ankle collars and sticky soles that grip a skateboard
    really
    well.[10]![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_10.jpg")
    -   These shoes were loved by skate punks and also punk musicians -
        they were worn by members of Minor Threat and Black Flag.
    -   Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars are another classic shoe
        embraced by skate punks.
    -   These are high-top trainers made of durable, flexible black
        canvas and feature the flat-soled grip that skateboarders
        love.[11]
4.  Dress in plenty of black.[12] Don’t limit your black clothing to
    just skinny jeans – skate punks usually opt for as much black as
    possible. Look for slim-fitting silhouettes in dark shades for all
    articles of
    clothing.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_11.jpg")
    -   Make sure you top everything off with a black hoodie that zips
        in the front. Many skate styles emphasize oversized hoodies, but
        skate punks generally go for a tighter fit.
    -   The skate punk attitude is very DIY. If you want to try a
        particular look and can’t find what you want in stores, make it
        yourself using thrift store elements.
5.  Accessorize with studded belts and bracelets. Skate punks don’t wear
    tons of accessories, since practicality is generally emphasized over
    some of the more classic punk elements like spikes and leather.
    However, a studded belt is a must and won’t get in the way of your
    skateboarding. Look for black leather or black material with metal
    studs for a classic skater punk
    look.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Tight-fitting arm bands and bracelets with a hardcore or spiked
        look are also popular.[13]
    -   One or even a few studs in your ears will also fit well into
        this style and won’t hinder you on your deck.
6.  Keep your hair short and spiky. Skate punks generally never go for
    long hair, so keep your locks short and gelled. Dark hair or dyed
    black is the popular look. For a bit of an edge, try a dyed stripe
    of bold color, like red, blue or
    green.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_13.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Skater girls typically have a similar style for their hair –
        short, messy and dyed.[14]

### Wearing the Hip Hop Street Style

1.  Wear baggy jeans.[15] This is one of the defining features of hip
    hop skater style (just as skinny jeans are to skate punk style).
    Don’t choose baggy jeans that are too extreme, because they may
    negatively affect your range of
    motion.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_14.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_14.jpg")
    -   Baggy sweat pants are also stylish in the hip hop scene and are
        probably more comfortable and street-ready for skating.
    -   To create the hip hop look, baggy isn’t just for pants. Opt for
        oversized silhouettes for most of your clothing.[16]
2.  Choose oversized t-shirts with graphic designs. Look for prints that
    emphasize urban grittiness and authenticity.[17] Any color is fair
    game – white, black, and all the colors in the rainbow are embraced
    for
    t-shirts.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_15.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_15.jpg")
    -   The key element is making sure the t-shirt is loose-fitting.
    -   Go for t-shirts that offer a pop of bright color to achieve a
        popular (and classic) street style look.[18]
3.  Wear trainers. Old school trainers, like the iconic Adidas
    Superstar, are still the most popular shoe type for urban
    skateboarders. These classic low-tops feature a rubber "shell-toe"
    design championed by skateboarders and rappers
    alike.[19]![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_16.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_16.jpg")
    -   Hip hop crews popularized the Adidas Superstar trainer in the
        early '80s New York street scene.
    -   They are still just as popular today as they were then, with no
        sign of losing their edge.[20]
4.  Sport a fitted snapback cap. The snapback is another quintessential
    fashion item for hip hop skaters.[21] The options are nearly
    limitless on this, but a popular look is to choose a vibrant
    snapback to add a pop of neon color to an
    ensemble.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_17.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_17.jpg")
    -   Snapbacks are worn facing forwards and backwards equally, so go
        with what you like.
    -   Wear a hoodie over your snapback for an authentic and classic
        look.
5.  Invest in bling.[22] This includes large chain necklaces (both gold
    and silver chains are popular), huge medallions and even grills
    (again, gold and silver are both popular choices). Chain necklaces
    are often layered, so try wearing more than
    one.![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_18.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_18.jpg")
    -   Do a single chain if you are wearing a huge, blinged out
        statement piece.
    -   A big, flashy watch (that fits well to the wrist) is another
        great accessory for this style.
6.  Choose brand names. Hip hop skater fashion highly emphasizes brand
    names. A few popular options are DVS Shoes and apparel, Supras, Fly
    Society, KR3W clothing, Famous Stars and Straps, BBC, Nike SB, Nixon
    watches, RS by Sheckler and New Era fitted
    hats.[23]![](Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_19.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Real_Skater_Step_19.jpg")
    -   A little research will unearth a wealth of other brand name
        options embraced by this culture that you can choose from.
