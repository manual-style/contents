Whether you are just learning how to skate, or just want to look like a
skater, there are a few things you could do to look the part. This
article will give you a few tips on how to dress like a skater girl; it
will also give you tips on how to style your hair and do your makeup.

## Steps

### Getting the Right Clothes

1.  Choose any shirt you like for a top. You can wear pretty much
    anything, but vintage and skate-brand shirts are the most popular
    among skaters. You can wear a faded t-shirt, a fitted shirt, or even
    a tank top. Consider wearing a fitted top if you are wearing baggy
    pants.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Consider going vintage. This doesn't mean that you have to wear
        clothes that are ripped or torn. Instead, try going to a
        second-hand store and picking up some vintage t-shirts from the
        80s and 90s.[1] They don't even have to be skateboard-related.
        Many skaters also like to wear vintage cartoon shirts as well.
2.  Finds baggy pants that are easy to move in. Even if you are posing
    as one, you may want to look as though you actually skateboard.
    Skateboarding requires a lot of leg moment, so you'll want something
    that is easy to move in. Here are some popular options for
    you:[2]![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Baggy leans are the most popular choice amongst skaters.
    -   Loose-fitting cargos are another popular choice. They are
        tomboyish, and the extra pockets are great for storing things,
        such as music players.
    -   Capris are another popular choice, especially if they are loose
        fitting and baggy. Think guy shorts.
    -   Avoid wearing anything that is too ripped or torn looking. It
        will just look messy.
3.  Choose girly bottoms with care. Skater girls will wear what is
    easiest for them to skate in. You might find that baggy clothes
    aren't all that comfortable, and that skinny jeans are the easiest
    for you to move around
    in.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Shorts are popular, especially in the summer. Many skater girls
        find high-waist shorts to be very comfortable. If you are
        learning how to skate, however, you might want to wear some
        kneepads in case you fall.
    -   Leggings are easy to move in, but they tear easily too. If you
        are just learning how to skate, you might want to hold off on
        the leggings to avoid ruining a nice pair.
    -   Skirts may look cute, but they are not always practical either.
        If you choose to wear a skirt, you might want to wear some
        leggings or biker shorts underneath them to prevent any
        embarrassing incidents.
    -   Skinny jeans can look great, but they can be difficult to move
        around in. If you want to wear skinny jeans, make sure that you
        can bend down and touch your board easily. If your jeans are too
        tight, you might not be able to perform any tricks.
4.  Choose skater shoes or canvas shoes/sneakers. You can sneakers that
    have a flat bottom and a good grip. Canvas shoes (high-tops are
    especially popular) are also a great choice, but keep in mind that
    they wear out quickly. Most skater girls will pass on the ballet
    flats and heels because its difficult (and sometimes dangerous) to
    skate while wearing
    them.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Try changing out the laces in your shoes for bright-colored
        ones. This is a great way to show off your personality.
    -   If you have canvas shoes, try drawings some cool designs on them
        using a fabric marker. You can also doodle on the toe area using
        a permanent marker.
5.  Don't forget to bring a jacket, hoodie, or long-sleeved shirt if it
    gets chilly. The skater look is all about layering, and a jacket
    thrown over a shirt can complete the look. A long-sleeved, plaid,
    flannel shirt can look especially chic when layered over a plain
    shirt or tied around the waist. When choosing jackets, try not to
    get anything too form-fitting; you want to be able to move your arms
    in order to perform tricks on your
    board.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")

### Getting the Right Accessories

1.  Hold back on the dangly jewelry. Most skater girls like to keep
    things simple and laid-back. Besides, long, dangling earrings and
    necklaces will only get in the way while skating. If you want to
    wear some jewelry, here are some things for you to
    try:![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Wristbands often come with stamped, printed, or engraved words
        and phrases. They are a great way to show your individuality.
    -   Sweatbands are comfortable to wear, and are often embroidered
        with a brand logo. They are a great way to show your support and
        enthusiasm for your favorite brands and companies.
    -   Studded bracelets are like mini versions of studded belts. You
        can find them in shops that sell punk attire.
2.  Wear a cap or a beanie. They not only keep the sun off your head,
    but can also keep long hair out of your face. Try finding one that
    has a logo of your favorite brand. If you can't find one, then get a
    plain one, and decorate it with a patch or pin. This is a great way
    to show support for your favorite
    brands.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Protect your hands with some fingerless gloves. If you'd like to
    show off your punk side, you can always put on a pair of fingerless
    gloves. They'll also help protect your palms in case you fall. If
    you can't find any, you can make your own by getting a pair of
    leather gloves and snipping the fingers off at the first
    knuckle.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
4.  Wear a belt. Baggy pants can be easy to move in, but if they are so
    baggy that they are sliding off your waist, you might want to use a
    belt to keep them up. A studded belt would be a great touch. You can
    get a standard belt with silver studs, or you can get a belt with
    colored
    studs.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Wear your headphones with pride. When you aren't listening to music,
    let the headphones hang around your
    neck.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you use earbuds, then you might want to roll them up and put
        them away so that they don't accidentally fall off and get
        damaged.

### Getting the Right Makeup and Hair

1.  Go light and easy on the makeup. Most skater girls will have a
    slight tom-boyish look to them. If you like to wear makeup, limit
    yourself to a tinted moisturizer and dark-colored eyeliner. If you
    want to give your lips some color, try wearing some lip
    gloss.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Try a smoky-eye look with thick, black eyeliner. You can also
        pair this with some tinted moisturizer, but don't add blush,
        bronzer, contouring, and lipstick, or your makeup will look too
        heavy.
2.  Wear long hair parted down the middle.[3] If you are going to be
    doing some tricks, you can wear a hat over it to keep it out of the
    way. You can also tie it back into a
    ponytail.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_12_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_12_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If your hair is curly or wavy, you can straighten it or leave it
        natural.
    -   If your hair is already straight, try adding in some beach waves
        into it for some texture.
    -   If you have long bangs, consider braiding them, and pinning them
        out of the way with a couple of bobby pins.
3.  Spike up short hair with some hair gel.[4] This will help keep your
    hair out of the
    way.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_13_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_13_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If your hair is too long to spike up, but too short to pull
        back, try wearing a hat over it. You can also brush it off to
        the side, or clip your bangs back.
4.  Consider dyeing your hair black or punky colors if you want to be a
    punk or scene skater girl. Keep in mind, however, that if you have
    really dark hair and want to dye it a lighter color, you will need
    to bleach it first. If you don't bleach it, the color may not show
    up. You can dye your bangs a punky color, such as blue, green, or
    purple. You can also try adding some colored streaks to
    it.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_14_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_14_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you want to dye your hair a punky color, but don't know what
        color to choose, try using some colored hair chalk in your hair;
        it will wash out the next time you wash it.
    -   You can experiment with streaks by clipping in a colored hair
        extension.
5.  Consider getting a choppy scene or emo hair cut. The skater style
    takes some inspiration from the scene and emo style. If you want to
    get fancy with your hair, this is something you could try. Be sure
    to cut lots of layers and to texture it with razor scissors. Style
    it by brushing the bangs off to one
    side.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_15_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_15_Version_2.jpg")
    -   If you have curly hair, try straightening just the bangs and
        leaving the rest of your hair curly. This will create a nice
        mixture of different textures.

### Putting Together the Right Look

1.  Choose the right combination of patterns and colors. Almost anything
    goes when it comes to skater fashion, but most girls will pair a
    certain pattern, such as florals or checkered, with something solid
    colored. Here are some patterns and colors commonly seen in skater
    girl
    fashion:![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_16_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_16_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Plaids
    -   Checker
    -   Pinstripe
    -   Black and white
    -   Black and red
    -   Solid white
    -   Solid black
2.  Play with layering, different colors, and mixed patterns. Skater
    fashion is all about layering baggy and fitted clothes. It's also
    about combining patterns, such as plaid or checkered, with solids.
    Here are some ideas to get you
    started:![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_17_Version_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_17_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Wear a long-sleeved shirt under a short-sleeved shirt.
    -   Pair a plaid button-down shirt with a white fitted shirt.
    -   Wear a loose shirt if you are wearing tight pants, and a fitted
        shirt if you are wearing baggy pants.
3.  Choose a tomboyish skater outfit. Skater girl fashion is usually a
    combination of punk, [scene](Be_a_Scene_Girl "wikilink"), and
    [tomboy](Be_a_Tomboy "wikilink").Here are some ideas to get you
    started:![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_18.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_18.jpg")
    -   Go monochrome with black jeans, black skater shoes, a faded
        black or grey vintage t-shirt, and a black and red cap.
    -   Mix and match with a pair of baggy capris, knee-high socks, a
        fitted shirt, a cap, and a pair of skater shoes.
    -   Play with layers by wearing a black ¾ sleeve shirt with a white
        t-shirt over that. Tie a red, plaid flannel shirt around your
        waist. Finish the look with some skinny jeans, canvas sneakers,
        and a cap.
    -   Go casual with a pair of skinny jeans, a loose-fitting white
        t-shirt, a pair of canvas sneakers, and a beanie.
4.  Try something more feminine if you are more girly. There is nothing
    wrong with that. Just be sure to layer different textures, colors,
    and patterns. Here are some ideas to get you
    started:![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_19.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_19.jpg")
    -   Try a red, plaid uniform skirt and a white, button-down shirt.
        Don't forget to wear a pair of fitted biker shorts under your
        skirt, especially if you plan on doing some skating that day.
    -   If it's a hot day, try wearing a pair of shorts and a white
        cropped, fitted top. Pair this with a light-colored beanie or a
        loose-fitting macramé top.
    -   Pair a black fitted shirt with a pair of shorts and black canvas
        sneakers. Wear a red plaid flannel shirt over this to complete
        the layered look.
    -   If you like wearing long pants, you can show off your girly side
        by pairing loose-fitting jeans with a pink tank top. You can
        also pair a loose t-shirt with some floral-printed skinny jeans.
5.  Layer your accessories. Don't limit yourself to just one wristband.
    Try wearing several. You can also pair a cap with some fingerless
    gloves, or a choker necklace with a pair of earphones draped around
    your
    neck.![](Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_20.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Skater_Girl_Step_20.jpg")

## Tips

-   Consider going to a skate brand store for your clothes. Skate shops
    are a great place to get your wardrobe started. After that, you can
    start picking up pieces from other shops.
-   If you go to a local skate shop, try asking the employees what they
    think would be the clothes a skater should wear.
-   Don't be ashamed to wear safety gear to a skate park, especially if
    you are learning how to skate.
-   If you are lost for ideas, try basing your style off of your
    favorite pro-skater. Just be sure to add a few changes to make it
    your own. You don't want to be a copy-cat.

## Warnings

-   Adjust your look gradually. You may be considered a poser if you
    suddenly change your look.
-   Don't wear all the same brand. Try to mix and match. If you wear
    shirts, pants, caps, hoodies, and accessories all from the same
    company, you'll look like a poser and might get made fun of.[5]
