Softball is an exciting sport that does require special uniforms for
game days. Whether you're new to the sport or just looking for a great
costume for a party, dressing like a softball player isn't too
complicated. Pick up your jersey, knee-high socks, cleats, and special
softball pants, and you're set!

## Steps

1.  Most people consider softball players to be ultra masculine (as if
    that's a bad thing) and casual in their dress. But that is not true!
    You can look great **and** be a softball player!
2.  Your Hair. Truth be told, you can wear it however you want, but most
    recommended is a high ponytail, and thin, colored headbands.
    Straight or loose waves is best. These headbands should in some way
    match your clothes! But if you are simply wearing white and/or, only
    your team color(s) should be worn. Also, French braids are really
    popular among softball players. Get a teammate to help you!
3.  Your Torso. Layer tank tops underneath in coordinating colors and if
    you want, throw on a semi-fitted (not very very form fitting! You
    aren't wearing things you can't play in, remember!) t-shirt, maybe
    one with your team's name on it, a college team you favor, a
    softball slogan, or a tournament shirt, or even a cute one. A
    popular thing to do is to cinch the sleeves up with a rubber band,
    it looks very cute and shows off your arms in a flattering way. But
    wear what you like! When it's cold or you need another layer, a
    blank hoodie, one made by Hollister, PacSun, or A&F, a brightly
    designed one (only if you are ready to get it dirty though!
    Remember, mindset!) or a stylish athletic jacket such as Under
    Armour, Adidas, or North Face would look great. Also, you can wear a
    sports bra or a regular, but a sports is much better if you are
    actually doing something.
4.  Your Legs. Normally sliding shorts are worn under everything for
    obvious reasons, but if this is an off day, I recommend wearing
    biking shorts underneath, they keep your thighs warm, give a little
    modesty under your regular shorts, and don't look half bad!
    Recommended in black only. Your shorts can be whatever color you
    like! Go crazy, but keep it relevant to your outfit. When you want
    to wear pants, slim fitting fleece bottoms look good or those smooth
    basketball-esque warm-up pants are excellent. Jeans can be worn, but
    they must be distressed, and either skinny, or a not very tight boot
    cut.
5.  Your Kicks. Wear whatever colored socks you like (black looks best
    though, to match your biking shorts) and grab a pair of black Adidas
    (or whatever brand) sliders. The reason for this trend is it relaxes
    your feet after wearing tight cleats all day pounding on that dirt
    field. And that can take a big toll as compared to playing in grass!
    If you do not want to wear these, I recommend a pair of Converses
    with arch supports, or a plain pair (not the puffy looking ones) of
    sneakers. Vans and skater shoes look good too. You can even wear
    Nike dunks or 6.0s. But be sure that some form of arch support is
    there, don't want you pulling your arch when you're running around
    the bases!
6.  Accessories. A drawstring bag, preferably a brand such as Nike or
    Under Armour, a water bottle, a bandanna, and your softball
    sunglasses (a pair of sports glasses), designer sunglasses (for
    everyday use), a small tube of lotion, Mp3 player and ear buds.
    Basically all your necessities and whatever else you may need!
7.  Your Physique. Most softball players have very strong torsos, arms,
    backs, and thighs mainly due to the power needed in hitting and
    defense, flaunt them! You earned them!

## Tips

-   Follow your team's dress code if they have one
-   Always wear sunscreen
-   Add what you like to this outfit template! You are yours to command!
-   Stay healthy!
-   I would not recommend wearing makeup, but if you do, keep it
    minimal, and away from your eyes!
-   Notice how the outfit you were given is generic.. that's right!
    There is no sign saying 'here's a softball player', you show the
    world you're a player, your outfit only let's you play the game
    easier.

## Warnings

-   You might face judgement and insults. Don't pay them any mind, you
    do what you do best - take names in your sport!
-   Never dress inappropriately, you are representing your school, your
    team, and all other softball players
-   Never be mean to any other sport player
