Have you ever showed up at the skate ranch and you see all the cool boys
and cool girls with their hot clothes on and you wish you could run home
and change. Well now you won't have to.

## Steps

1.  Wear cute clothes. When you go to the skate ranch everybody is
    trying to look cool. So you should too. So buy new clothes, nothing
    with Hannah Montana on it or Jonas brothers or high school musical.
    That's lame. Try forever, 21, and body
    shop.![](Look_Cool_when_You_Go_to_the_Skate_Ranch_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cool_when_You_Go_to_the_Skate_Ranch_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
2.  Make up. You always want guys to notice your face, so make sure you
    were a whole bunch of lip gloss that will last you the whole night.
    Also wear make up. Not to heavy but not to light. Bubblicious bubble
    gum might make guys notice you.and sense the first thing guys notice
    is your eyes wear eye shadow and mascara for that hot girl
    look.![](Look_Cool_when_You_Go_to_the_Skate_Ranch_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cool_when_You_Go_to_the_Skate_Ranch_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
3.  Act and sound cool. Always join into the crowd, never act out. But,
    if you do act out, act out in a good way. Don't sound too ghetto but
    sound like you know people and your no
    scared.![](Look_Cool_when_You_Go_to_the_Skate_Ranch_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cool_when_You_Go_to_the_Skate_Ranch_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
4.  NEVER never fall. If your at the skate ranch, don't ever fall. If
    you do fall then everyone will remember and make fun of you. No
    matter who you are. Also you might get squished and that
    HURTS.![](Look_Cool_when_You_Go_to_the_Skate_Ranch_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cool_when_You_Go_to_the_Skate_Ranch_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Always have a cellphone. If you don't then you can get kicked out
    because you don't have a cell to call your ride to get you. If you
    don't have a phone invite a friend with one so you can get
    home.![](Look_Cool_when_You_Go_to_the_Skate_Ranch_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cool_when_You_Go_to_the_Skate_Ranch_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Always bring money. If you don't you won't be able to get in and you
    won't get snacks either. Trust me- you will get
    hungry.![](Look_Cool_when_You_Go_to_the_Skate_Ranch_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Look_Cool_when_You_Go_to_the_Skate_Ranch_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")

## Tips

-   When you are there act cool and always be on the prowl. You never
    know whose after you. Bring a phone and NO GANG SIGNS, security is
    tight in that place now so throwing up gang signs can get you kick
    out and sometimes even band.

## Warnings

-   If you wear make up and dress cool, but it doesn't suit you, don't
    wear it (and vice versa.)
-   If you fall you will regret it in the morning cause you will ache
    all over. Also
