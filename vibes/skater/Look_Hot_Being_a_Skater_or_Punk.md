Have you ever noticed that skater boys and punks often have a lot of
girls falling at their feet? Jealous much? Well this is the way you do
it.

## Steps

1.  Make sure you smell good. Bathe or shower regularly, wash your
    clothes frequently - especially your undies - and use a
    deodorant.![](Look_Hot_Being_a_Skater_or_Punk_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Hot_Being_a_Skater_or_Punk_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Wear trendy clothes with an element of skater or punk style. Wearing
    too much leather and too many studs will scare the girls
    off!![](Look_Hot_Being_a_Skater_or_Punk_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Hot_Being_a_Skater_or_Punk_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Get a hair cut: short or medium. If it's short, make sure its
    something nice (not a mini Mohawk). A faux hawk works, but remember
    you don't want to scare girls away. If it's medium, let it be shaggy
    or wear a cap if you don't want it to look like you never wash, comb
    or brush it, then tease it a little and apply gel to hold the
    style.![](Look_Hot_Being_a_Skater_or_Punk_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Hot_Being_a_Skater_or_Punk_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Skaters need skate shoes, like Adio or Emerica, but there are
    cheaper options like underground. Punks should know what looks right
    otherwise its
    pointless.![](Look_Hot_Being_a_Skater_or_Punk_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Hot_Being_a_Skater_or_Punk_Step_4.jpg")

## Tips

-   Talk to girls.
-   Accessorise. Wear a chain, or bandannas in your pocket but make sure
    you don't look like a gang member!
-   Wear clothes that suit your body shape.
-   You can go with Emo hair
-   Wash your hair every day
-   Highlights in your hair look a bit effeminate - girls don't like it
-   Don't do this if you're trying to get a girl, punk is being true to
    yourself!!!

## Warnings

-   Many people will judge you on your appearance. If you look a little
    rough round the edges some will assume that you are up to no good.
    Remember that it is your right to look and dress any way you choose,
    but also keep in mind that you can get a long way with good manners
    and charm!
