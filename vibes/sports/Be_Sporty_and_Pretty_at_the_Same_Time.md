There are a lot of sporty girls out there and sometimes they claim that
they either don't need to look [pretty](Be_Pretty "wikilink") or don't
have the time to make themselves look nice. You don't need to look like
a runway model but sometimes its nice to wear something other than
sweats for a change.

## Steps

1.  Find your style. Some girls like preppy or emo or another defined
    style. Experiment and find out what look you like. If you want to
    carry your sporty side off the field find clothes that reflect that
    side of you but do not make you look like you belong on the field or
    the
    court.![](Be_Sporty_and_Pretty_at_the_Same_Time_Step_1.jpg "fig:Be_Sporty_and_Pretty_at_the_Same_Time_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Find clothes that suit your style. If you are going for sporty wear
    sweats, running/basketball/tennis shoes, athletic shorts, and shirts
    that support your favorite team. It's probably best NOT to wear your
    jersey everywhere you go (save it for the game). When you're still
    trying to figure out what to wear you should experiment and see what
    you like and what you don't
    like.![](Be_Sporty_and_Pretty_at_the_Same_Time_Step_2.jpg "fig:Be_Sporty_and_Pretty_at_the_Same_Time_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Make time! Many girls say they don't have time to look good because
    of their activities. It doesn't take that much time to pick out a
    shirt that you didn't wear last night to practice and put on a real
    bra instead of your sports

4.  Get a lot of sleep. You'll need it. Your sport tires you out and you
    have to balance your life. It's hard to ace the math test when
    you've slept through every math class for the past
    month.![](Be_Sporty_and_Pretty_at_the_Same_Time_Step_4.jpg "fig:Be_Sporty_and_Pretty_at_the_Same_Time_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Have fun! Never forget about your
    sports.![](Be_Sporty_and_Pretty_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5.jpg "fig:Be_Sporty_and_Pretty_at_the_Same_Time_Step_5.jpg")

## Tips

-   If you find yourself wearing the same clothes and just rotating
    between one hoodie, one pair of jeans and one pair of sweats it may
    be time to go shopping.
-   If you are stuck at a golf match or have a softball tourney all day,
    don't worry about looking good. You're there to play and show off
    your talent on the field not on the runway!

## Warnings

-   Don't let your sport run your life but don't get caught up in
    looking perfect. Find a good balance in your life and stick to it.
