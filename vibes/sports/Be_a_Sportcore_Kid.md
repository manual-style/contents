Sporty. Tennis socks, puma headbands and Sweatbands etc. The music is
Psychedelic and Indie rock. Natural hair color or brown is the trend in
the Sport kid scene right now.

    -   Boys: Tennis shorts, skinny jeans although more of a faded

        acceptable.

    core.![](Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
5.  Never wear black. You're not Emo. No makeup like eyeliner. But boys
    should apply almost color toned foundation on their lips. Girls
    should have natural or bright pink lips. THIS IS A
    MUST!![](Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
6.  Get a Monroe piercing and a bridge. Don't get snakebites. Septum is
    allowed but might seem a little too
    scene.![](Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
7.  Go to Indie shows. Keep the Hippie spirit
    up.![](Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
8.  Wear necklaces with the Nike or Adidas logo. It's a
    plus.![](Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
9.  Call yourself a Sports core but NOT a Sport kid. It will just make
    you seem like a Poser. When this trend goes mainstream, stop calling
    yourself Sports core. You don't wanna be a
    poser.![](Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
10. Hair: You want scene hair for this, but don't multicolor it. You
    want a somewhat clean
    look.![](Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sportcore_Kid_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
