Sporty girls are healthy, active, and low-maintenance. They eat healthy
foods, drink lots of water, and get plenty of sleep. Pick up a sport you
like, and try out for a team. To get a sporty look, wear jerseys,
T-shirts, crew necks, leggings, and athletic shorts. Go for a neutral
makeup look, throw your hair up in a ponytail, and you'll be ready for
the game!

## Steps

### Playing Sports

1.  Pick a sport you enjoy and learn the basics. Try a sport you've
    never played before or go with one you know already. Do some
    research on the rules, equipment, and number of players. Consider
    the sport's overall difficulty, required supplies, and practice
    location to narrow your options. Make your choice based on what
    seems the most fun and easy to pick
    up![1]![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_1_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_1_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Popular sports include [soccer](Play-Soccer "wikilink"),
        [basketball](Play-Basketball "wikilink"),
        [softball](Play-Softball "wikilink"), [track and
        field](Prepare-for-Track "wikilink"), [cross
        country](Run-Cross-Country "wikilink"), field hockey,
        [volleyball](Play-Volleyball "wikilink"), and
        [gymnastics](Do-Gymnastics "wikilink").
    -   For example, if you've never played hockey, trying to pick up
        ice hockey may be more challenging than field hockey, since you
        will need ice skates and protective gear.
    -   Try playing multiple sports! You can even play on
        non-professional, community teams.
2.  Purchase your gear so you can start to play! Search online for
    things like "Basketball gear" or "Field hockey supplies" to find out
    what equipment you need to play. Then, purchase your gear at a
    sports store, either online or in person. You will need proper
    footwear, protective gear, and a ball for most
    sports.![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_2_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_2_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For example, buy cleats, shin guards, socks, and a soccer ball
        to pick up soccer. If you want to play softball, buy a glove,
        bat, and softball.
    -   You can also ask employees at sporting stores to help you gather
        gear.
3.  Practice playing the sport in your free time to strengthen your
    skills. Learn the basics by watching online tutorials and games.
    Practice your moves in your backyard, or visit a local park, gym, or
    YMCA and recruit your friends or family to play with you! You may
    need to practice for a bit to develop your skills, so don't fret if
    you don't get the hang of it right
    away.![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_3_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_3_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For example, to learn volleyball, practice how to spike, bump,
        and serve. Try out playing opponents across the net.
    -   If you aren't enjoying the game after practicing a sport for a
        while, try a different sport!
4.  Try out for a local school or community team when you feel
    confident. Search online for things like “Local soccer team,” or
    “Community girls softball” to find teams to try out for. Look for
    both school and community teams. Research how competitive each
    tryout may be to narrow your options. When you find a team in your
    area that seems to match your skill level, try out for the
    team![2]![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_4_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_4_Version_2.jpg")
    -   For example, if you just started playing basketball, a community
        team based on your age group may be a better starting place than
        the varsity team at your high school.
    -   Instructions and information about how and when to try out for
        the team should be available on each team's website. If not,
        look for a contact number and call for more information.
    -   If you aren't quite confident enough to try out, keep
        practicing! Play with your friends, watch sporting games, and
        look into online tutorials.
5.  Attend each practice on time. After you make the team, expand upon
    your skills during weekly practices. Make sure you are always on
    time for each practice and that you attend as many practices as you
    can. This will continue to develop your skills and show your
    reliability and accountability to your coach and
    teammates.![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_5_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_5_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Occasional absences happen, like if you are sick or if there is
        a family emergency. Let your coach know as soon as you can if
        you know you will not make it to a practice.
    -   If your schedule allows it, you can show up 10-15 minutes early.
        This shows your coaches you care about being on time, and it
        will give you a few minutes to chat with other girls on your
        team.
6.  Stop playing and notify your coach, parents, or doctor if you are
    injured. Playing through an injury can make the damage worse. If you
    are injured during a practice or game, stop playing, sit on the
    sideline, and assess the damage. Go to your doctor or the hospital
    if your injuries are serious, like if you hit your head, strain a
    muscle, or break a bone. Make sure you give yourself adequate time
    to
    heal![3]![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_6_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_6_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Healing time will vary based on injury. Your doctor will let you
        know an approximate heal time. They will also stabilize your
        injury, like [wrapping your knee](Wrap-Your-Knee "wikilink") for
        ligament damage.
    -   You can [prevent
        injuries](Prevent-Injuries-While-Participating-in-Sports "wikilink")
        by stretching, using proper form, and taking breaks when needed.

### Getting a Sporty Look

1.  Apply minimal or no makeup for a [natural
    look](Apply-Makeup-for-a-Natural-Look "wikilink"). Between workouts,
    practices, and games, sporty girls don't have time for makeup! Go
    natural and don't wear any makeup. If you want to wear a little, you
    can wear a little mascara or a matte
    lipgloss.[4]![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_7_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_7_Version_2.jpg")
    -   You can also dust a little bit of compact foundation to even out
        your skin tone.
    -   Sporty girls don't wear much makeup because they may sweat it
        off in gym class or at practice. Makeup and sweat can lead to
        clogged pores and acne.
2.  Tie your hair in a [ponytail](Make-a-Ponytail "wikilink") for a
    sporty style. You likely tie your hair up for workouts and
    practices, so just rock it as your daily style. You'll have more
    time to squeeze in another warm-up stretch! Pull your hair back at
    the top of your head, and secure your hair with a hair
    tie.![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_8_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_8_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Ponytails make cute, sporty styles for a variety of hair
        lengths.
    -   If you want a variety, you can also add braids or other cute
        accents to a ponytail that give it visual interest while keeping
        it practical.
3.  Put on an elastic or cotton headband if you want to hold your hair
    back. Headbands keep your hair out of your face and hide frizz and
    stray hairs. Grab a colorful, patterned, or neutral headband, in
    either stretchy elastic or soft cotton materials. Place the headband
    onto your head, and push it back about past your
    hairline.[5]![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_9_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_9_Version_2.jpg")
    -   You can wear elastic headbands during practices and games. Try
        cotton headbands for day-to-day looks.
    -   Headbands are great to keep your hair back if your hair is short
        and can't fit in a ponytail.
4.  Wear jerseys, T-shirts, and crew neck sweatshirts for a sporty
    style. Wear sports jerseys of your favorite players or your own
    jerseys from previous teams or seasons. Pick out other baggy style
    T-shirts for a [tomboy look](Dress-Like-a-Tomboy "wikilink").
    Purchase crewneck long sleeve shirts and sweatshirts for thicker
    layers.![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_10_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_10_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Sporty brands include Under Armor, Nike, Adidas, and Champion,
        to name a few. Most major department stores have an athletics
        section you can shop from as well.
5.  Wear athletic leggings and shorts to match your active life.
    Leggings are super comfortable and great for on-the-go girls. Style
    them with jerseys, T-shirts, or sweatshirts. Wear athletic or gym
    shorts on warm days. Both leggings and shorts come in solid colors
    and funky patterns. You can easily wear these to school, when
    running errands, or to
    practice!![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_11_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_11_Version_2.jpg")
    -   You can get athletic leggings in cotton or
        cotton-polyester-lycra combination. Cotton leggings are a bit
        softer, and the blends are quick-drying for sweaty workouts.
6.  Wear sporty shoes like Converse or sneakers. Sporty girls live
    active, on-to-go lifestyles, and their feet must be comfy! Purchase
    athletic footwear for your sports, like cleats or running shoes.
    Then, get a pair of daily shoes like Nikes, Adidas, or Reebok. You
    can also go for sporty sandals like
    Chacos.[6]![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_12.jpg")
    -   You can choose shoes in bright colors! Sneakers come in all
        sorts of colors like pink and neon, and patterns, like polka
        dots, and zig-zags.

### Leading a Healthy, Sporty Lifestyle

1.  Eat 3 healthy meals a day. [Healthy foods](Eat-Healthy "wikilink")
    will keep your body fueled with the nutrients and minerals it needs.
    Eat meals with lots of fruits, vegetables, protein, and whole
    grains, and eat 3 meals a day. Aim for at least 5 servings of
    vegetables and 4 servings of
    fruit.[7]![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_13.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_13.jpg")
    -   Avoid foods high in cholesterol, salt, fat, and sugar, like junk
        food, fast food, candy, and soda.
2.  Drink about 8 to 10 glasses (2 L) of water each day. Carry a water
    bottle with you throughout your day, and refill it at water
    fountains as you finish it. Keeping hydrated is required for active
    girls![8]![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_14_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_14_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Make sure you drink extra water on days you have practice or
        games. Drink water until you don't feel thirsty. The amount will
        vary depending on how much you sweat, though you can drink
        around 4 cups (1 L). Your body will thank you!
3.  [Exercise](Work-Out "wikilink") about 4-5 days a week to stay in
    shape. Sporty girls work out nearly every day, between practice and
    gym time. Stretch before and after your workouts to keep your
    muscles flexible and prevent injury. Do [aerobic
    exercise](Do-Aerobics "wikilink") to get your blood pumping every
    day for 30-90 minutes. You can also work on your balance, speed, and
    endurance.[9]![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_15_Version_2.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_15_Version_2.jpg")
    -   Try things like swimming, basketball, and running.
    -   You can take a work-out class or recruit a friend to be your gym
        buddy.
4.  Sleep about 8-10 hours a day. You need proper sleep to stay alert
    and do your best, either in school or during a game. Lack of sleep
    results in slower response time and low energy. Go to bed early, and
    set your alarm for at least 8 hours after you go to
    sleep.[10]![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_16.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_16.jpg")
    -   Avoid exercising 2-3 hours (or more) before bed. It can be
        difficult to sleep if you just worked out or came back from a
        late game.
5.  Get an annual physical from your doctor to monitor your health. Your
    doctor can check your growth and nutrient levels to make sure you
    are healthy. Ask your doctor for tips on stretching, exercise, and
    healthy
    foods.[11]![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_17.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_17.jpg")
6.  Make friends with other sporty girls. In addition to your other
    friends, you can befriend the other girls on your team since you
    have a common interest. Introduce yourself, and talk to them before
    and after practice. You can watch sports games together and talk
    about your favorite
    players.![](Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_18.jpg "fig:Be_a_Sporty_Girl_Step_18.jpg")
    -   You can also make friends with other girls who go to your gym.
