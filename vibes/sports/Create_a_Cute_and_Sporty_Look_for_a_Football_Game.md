    sun.![](Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_2.jpg "fig:Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Put the concealer of your choice under your eyes, on your eyelids
    (to act as a primer), around the corners of your nose and mouth, and
    in a thin line along the top of your nose. Blend it all in. Cover
    any other spots if
    necessary.![](Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_3.jpg "fig:Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Even out your skin tone after the concealer by putting on a
    foundation of your choice. Work your way outwards from the center of
    your
    face.![](Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_4.jpg "fig:Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Take a light pink eyeshadow and apply a very, very little bit to
    your lids, then blend in. Use the same light pink to highlight your
    brow
    bone.![](Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_5.jpg "fig:Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_5.jpg")

10. Take a small section of hair right by your eyes on the edge of your
    actual hair, and braid it. Only braid it until about halfway down
    the
    strand.![](Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_10.jpg "fig:Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_10.jpg")
11. Pull the half braid back to the side of your head, and, with a bobby
    pin, pin it to your hair right where the braid
    ends.![](Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_11.jpg "fig:Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_11.jpg")
12. Let the other half of the strand fall down in with your hair. Brush
    it in for a more natural
    look.![](Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_12.jpg "fig:Create_a_Cute_and_Sporty_Look_for_a_Football_Game_Step_12.jpg")
