Soccer is an excellent sport to participate in, requiring strength,
coordination, and focus. However, while you're not playing in games, you
may want the world to recognize you as a soccer player. Follow this
guide to learn how to successfully dress like a soccer player.

## Steps

1.  Wear casual hairstyles. Sports requires females to wear practical
    hairstyles when participating in vigorous exercises, especially
    since they cannot afford to have hair in their face. You can start
    pulling your hair into loose ponytails, messy buns, or braids. To
    keep stray hairs or bangs back from your face, wear a thin headband
    made from pre-wrap. You can find one at your local sports store near
    the medical
    aisle.![](Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Wear sports shirts. It is best to purchase ones from well-known
    sports brands, as people will be able to recognize that you're
    wearing athletic clothing. You could also wear a shirt from at
    tournament that you have participated in. Be sure that the shirt
    fits your body and that the color complements your skin
    tone.![](Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Wear soccer shorts. This will allow easy movement and a free range
    of motion. It will also prevent you from becoming overheated when
    you participate in vigorous exercises. To keep your hamstrings warm,
    wear a pair of tighter shorts
    underneath.![](Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Wear a track jacket. Although most clubs and countries offer their
    own track jackets, it's recommended that you purchase a general
    black one with white stripes. This is the epitome of a soccer warm
    up. You can wear a t-shirt underneath, but stay away from
    jerseys.![](Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Purchase jerseys. You can wear these to support your favorite club
    or country. Although unnecessary, it is best to have a player name
    to specifically identify your passion for support. To display your
    jersey best, be sure that your hair or other clothing doesn't cover
    important logos or names.

6.  Wear jerseys in outrageous colors. Although some people may prefer
    quieter shades, don't hesitate to purchase jerseys in striking
    colors. These will allow you to stand out from the crowd and show
    people that you support a certain club or country. It makes you more
    identifiable as a fan, and you may find others with common
    interests.

    -   For instance, Sevilla has a pink-purple home jersey.
7.  Pair shorts/jeans with tops. Have a variety of color in your outfits
    rather than wearing the same shade in your tops and bottoms.
    Although you shouldn't feel overly self-conscious about whether your
    socks match your shirt, you should endeavor to provide contrast in
    your outfits. For instance, green with blue generally appears
    pleasing to the
    eye.![](Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_7.jpg")
8.  Purchase reliable shoes. They are also a major indicator of your
    serious interest in soccer. Despite the fact that everyday soccer
    shoes are unavailable, indoor soccer shoes provide a good
    alternative. Most indoor shoes have a match with real cleats. If you
    like the Total 90s, an indoor version is available. The same goes
    for all major brands. If you don't want to wear indoor soccer shoes
    you could also wear slides with
    socks.![](Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_8.jpg")
9.  Avoid wearing common jerseys. Having a wardrobe of well-known
    jerseys will only give you the appearance of attempting to fit in
    with the soccer crowd. For instance, wearing a Beckham jersey will
    be seen as following the crowd. Although you can occasionally wear
    one, you should stick to rarer jerseys, as it shows that you are
    serious about all aspects of soccer. However, be sure that your
    motives are in check; only wear jerseys supporting
    teams/clubs/countries that you truly like. Make sure you are not
    ignorant in your
    selections.![](Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_9.jpg")
10. Invest in a backpack. Although they are optional, they can serve as
    a supporting accessory that completes your soccer outfit. Most club
    shops provide backpacks displaying the club's logo. Generally, they
    also sell sack packs if you prefer those. Be sure that you choose a
    color that matches your
    clothes.![](Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Like_a_Soccer_Player_(Girls)_Step_10.jpg")
11. Strengthen your calf muscles. Having strong calf muscles indicates
    that you are serious about soccer. It also blends with the general
    stereotypes of soccer, which include fit players, washboard abs, and
    reasonably attractive facial features. Once you have built up your
    muscles, you can show them off.

-   Most of Europe's premier talents are unheard of here in the USA, so
    again, be knowledgeable.
-   Websites like WorldSoccerShop.com, KitBag.com, offer a reasonable
    selection of jerseys at moderate prices.
-   Let your style reflect you passion.
-   Don't over-do it.
-   If you know nothing about football outside USA, its okay, you don't
    have to become an expert with European or South American football.
    Just simply wear what you enjoy and inject some personal football
    into it!
-   Try to refrain from wearing full kits, that is, don't wear an
    Argentina jersey with Argentina shorts.
-   Don't all of a sudden change your style to be cool, be yourself, or
    you'll look like a poser.
-   Take pride in your dressing.
-   Don't be a poser. Be knowledgeable in the current world of football.
-   Remember, lesser known clubs can be bought at often cheaper prices
    and present a unique, interesting style.
-   The more you enjoy and know football (soccer) the more it will
    reflect in your soccer fashions.
-   Jerseys often show a sign of identity. Some clubs are associated
    with "cult" like followings. FC St. Pauli of Germany is associated
    with a liberal, punk image. So just be aware. While Ajax and
    Tottenham fans are known to embrace their Jewish support and become
    a part of club culture.
-   Retro jerseys are cheaper than newer ones and give a vintage flair.
    A Johan Cruyff or Diego Maradona jersey will tribute respect as well
    as more fashionable than recent ones.
-   Big player jerseys, like Beckham, Ronaldinho, are obvious to soccer
    fans, and casual fans alike. Show people you are smart in the world
    of soccer. Sport maybe a smaller club like Bristol Rovers, or teams
    like PSV Eindhoven, Aston Villa, Atletico Madrid, Werder Bremen.
    These teams are well known in Europe, but get less exposure in the
    States. But do your own research.
