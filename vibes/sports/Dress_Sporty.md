If you want to dress sporty, you only need a few basic items. Athletic
gear like track pants, gym shorts, and workout shirts can be worn
together or paired with other items like jeans and tanks. Choose
clothing with athletic-inspired details and add sporty accessories to
complete your look. If you follow a few basic tips, you’ll be able to
dress sporty for any occasion.

## Steps

### Building a Sporty Wardrobe

1.  Select clothing with a relaxed feel. Athletes need to be able to
    move around comfortably in their clothes, which means sporty clothes
    are often more casual than other garments. Stick with loose or
    stretchy items, rather than clothes that restrict your
    movement.[1]![](Dress_Sporty_Step_1.jpg "fig:Dress_Sporty_Step_1.jpg")
    -   For instance, opt for relaxed-fit jeans over tight skinny jeans.
2.  Stock up on athletic gear. Basketball or gym shorts, workout or yoga
    pants, and tracksuits should be staples of your wardrobe. Workout
    tanks and T-shirts are also essential items, and you may want a few
    tennis skirts as well. You can wear an athletic outfit all together
    for a super sporty look, or pair athletic items with other garments
    to give just a hint of
    sportiness.[2]![](Dress_Sporty_Step_2.jpg "fig:Dress_Sporty_Step_2.jpg")
    -   For example, wear jeans and a T-shirt with an athletic company
        logo, then finish off the look with a track jacket and
        sunglasses.
    -   Alternatively, pair a tennis skirt with net booties and a trendy
        top.
3.  Choose garments with athletic details. Horizontal stripes, rugby
    shirts, raglan shirts (baseball-style tees with colored sleeves),
    racerbacks, and jersey-style details, like numbers, help to sport up
    your look. A jacket with a striped wrist cuff or a floral
    jersey-style top are great
    choices.[3]![](Dress_Sporty_Step_3.jpg "fig:Dress_Sporty_Step_3.jpg")
    -   For instance, opt for a bodycon dress with a racerback and pair
        it with sunglasses and sneakers.
    -   Or, pair a rugby shirt with jeans, boots, and a sporty watch.
4.  Opt for items with athletic company logos. Skateboarding, surfing,
    and other sports brands literally advertise your sportiness. Stock
    up on T-shirts, tracksuits, sport shorts, or shoes with logos like
    O’Neill, Vans, Adidas, Nike, Volcom, Puma, Jordans, and Under
    Armour. Feel free to wear one brand from head to toe, or mix and
    match your favorite
    pieces.[4]![](Dress_Sporty_Step_4.jpg "fig:Dress_Sporty_Step_4.jpg")
    -   For instance, wear a button-down with jeans and Jordans.
    -   Alternatively, wear a graphic logo tee with a skirt and heels.
5.  Wear clothing that advertises your favorite team. You can find
    clothing with logos of your favorite team, whether it’s a
    professional, college, or even high school sport. Or, you can opt
    for items in your favorite team’s colors. Choose caps, jerseys,
    T-shirts, sweaters, or jackets that display your love for your
    favorite
    teams.![](Dress_Sporty_Step_5.jpg "fig:Dress_Sporty_Step_5.jpg")
    -   Look for merchandise stands at games, check your local
        department store, or order items online.
    -   For instance, wear a sports jersey with jeans and boots or opt
        for trousers paired with a sweater in your team’s colors.
6.  Make hoodies a wardrobe staple. Nothing says athletic like a hoodie!
    Pick out several in your favorite colors or styles and toss one on
    any time it gets chilly. You can even opt for hoodies that advertise
    your favorite athletic company or sports
    team.[5]![](Dress_Sporty_Step_6.jpg "fig:Dress_Sporty_Step_6.jpg")
    -   Wear a hoodie with track pants and a baseball cap for the
        ultimate sporty look.
    -   Or, pair a zip-front hoodie with jeans, a thermal shirt, boots,
        and a ball cap.
7.  Layer on a varsity-style jacket. Whether you wear your actual letter
    jacket or pick up a varsity-style jacket online or in a store, it’s
    the perfect cold-weather accessory for any
    outfit.[6]![](Dress_Sporty_Step_7.jpg "fig:Dress_Sporty_Step_7.jpg")
    -   Toss a varsity-style jacket on over jeans, a T-shirt, and
        sneakers. Add a cap and a gym bag to complete the look.
    -   Alternatively, wear a varsity-style jacket over a playful dress
        for a sporty chic vibe.

### Adding Accessories

1.  Stock up on sunglasses. Sunglasses are an essential accessory for a
    sporty look. Not only do they protect your eyes, some offer
    performance-enhancing lenses to help you excel at whichever sport
    you play. Choose a variety of styles, from aviators to wraparound
    sunglasses, so that you’ll have a pair for every
    occasion.[7]![](Dress_Sporty_Step_8.jpg "fig:Dress_Sporty_Step_8.jpg")
2.  Add a cap or visor. Nothing says sporty like a ball cap or visor.
    Pick several with different colors and logos so you can top off
    every outfit. If you have long hair, consider looping it through the
    hole in the back of a ball cap for a super sporty
    style.![](Dress_Sporty_Step_9.jpg "fig:Dress_Sporty_Step_9.jpg")
    -   For instance, pair a Titleist visor with a T-shirt and track
        pants when you’re out walking the dog or checking the mail.
3.  Invest in several pairs of sneakers. Sneakers are a sporty staple.
    Pick several pairs in different colors and styles so you can
    coordinate them with any outfit.[8] Choose a simple pair, like black
    Nikes, as well as a pair that makes more of a statement, like
    patterned
    Vans.![](Dress_Sporty_Step_10.jpg "fig:Dress_Sporty_Step_10.jpg")
4.  Go for boat shoes or net booties when dressing up. Net or mesh
    booties add a sporty vibe to fancy footwear. Pair net booties with
    stretchy skinny jeans or a body-con dress.[9] Boat shoes are another
    shoe that you can easily pair with dressier items and still keep
    that sporty
    feel.[10]![](Dress_Sporty_Step_11.jpg "fig:Dress_Sporty_Step_11.jpg")
5.  Add a fitness tracker or sporty watch. To tie your sporty outfit
    together, a fitness tracker or sporty watch is the perfect
    accessory. Choose one in a bright color to make it stand out, or opt
    for basic black for a more functional
    look.[11]![](Dress_Sporty_Step_12.jpg "fig:Dress_Sporty_Step_12.jpg")
6.  Carry a gym or sports bag. Rather than carrying a traditional
    backpack to school, toss your books in a gym bag instead. Or, carry
    your phone, wallet, and other essentials in a drawstring sports bag
    on the weekends. Opt for a simple black bag, or pick one with an
    athletic company or sports team
