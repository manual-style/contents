Always wondered how those rich, cute girls manage to pull off that
sporty and cute look that's always in for spring and summer? Good news!
It takes less money and effort than you might think!

## Steps

1.  Go to your wardrobe or a cute clothing store, and find a cute, but
    not too cute, like a Tee shirt or tank top, go for lighter colors,
    baby blue, pink, light grey, this will make you look fit and lighter
    colors brings out your eyes. If you want to look sexy and sporty,
    wear a V-Neck Tee. Also you can get spandex material sports bras,
    they have good support, and makes good
    undershirts.![](Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_1.jpg "fig:Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Next step, find some cute shorts, which you can get at Academy or
    other athletic stores, sweat pants are okay, but not for this look
    you're going for. Nike or Under Armour shorts are the best shorts
    for this look, they're short, but not too short. If you want to wear
    longer shorts, but still look good. Also, long shorts with little
    holes in them are recommended, but for this look, you should go no
    longer than your
    knees.![](Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_2.jpg "fig:Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Wear the right shoes. If you want to nudge the sporty bar up a bit,
    get cute running shoes. Also if you want easy to put on shoes, get
    some Nike slides, they are perfect for this sporty
    look.![](Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_3.jpg "fig:Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Remember that hair is important! It is the main part that makes your
    outfit cute, not completely sporty. If you have longer hair
    (shoulder-length and longer), put your hair into a messy high bun,
    you just put your hair into a high ponytail, then get another hair
    tie and wrap your hair around the first hair tie. Also for people
    that have long bangs, get the head bands that are the same material
    as a hair tie, you can get those in cute colors (pink, yellow, light
    blue, etc.) or those that match your hair color if you have brown or
    black hair are recommended (Don't get yellow if you have blond
    hair). Pin the hairband down with bobby
    pins.![](Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_4.jpg "fig:Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_4.jpg")
    -   If you have shorter hair, you can always french braid or regular
        braid, if it's too short then you can just get the stretchy head
        bands and pull your bangs back.You also could try to put it in a
        side
        ponytail.![](Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_4Bullet1.jpg "fig:Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_4Bullet1.jpg")
5.  Makeup is important! Since this is a sporty and cute look, you
    should put on makeup a little lighter, not too bold. If you prefer
    eye shadow, then you should use lighter colors, if you have blue or
    green eyes go for a light brown, and if you have brown or hazel
    eyes, go for an orange or blue color. I think you shouldn't use base
    or eyeliner for this look, you don't want to look like you're trying
    too
    hard.![](Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_5.jpg "fig:Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_5.jpg")
6.  And last step, bags. You don't want to wear a hand bag,if you're
    actually going to work out, you should carry a regular backpack or
    duffel bag to keep your clothes and other things in. If you just
    want to look sporty, but still carry stuff, wear a "hobo" bag, you
    can get them a Journey's shoe store and other places, it is pretty
    big, but not too big, and it slings over your shoulder
    easily.![](Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_6.jpg "fig:Get_a_Sporty_Cute_Look_(for_Girls)_Step_6.jpg")
