Phew! PE/Gym classes is over. Now you look oily and sweating. Worry no

2.  Change your clothes. Sometimes odor is trapped at the clothes that
    you wear. You don't want to maintain the same odor.

3.  Use something that absorbs oil. This is handy especially when you
    have an oily face.
4.  Use a concealer. You want to make your face look flawless after your
    workout. Make sure you don't use too much though.

5.  Use a translucent powder. This will set the concealer that you have
    used.
6.  Use a eyeshadow. One or two colours are enough. Put it gently into
    your eyes. You may put a primer first to help it stay longer on your
    eyes.

11. Fix your hair. You still want to be presentable after your work out.
    Maybe comb it with your fingers or an actual comb and throw it into
    a ponytail or bun. You could also try braiding in. If you'd rather
    just leave it down, that's fine too, but make sure that your hair is
    brushed. If you leave your hair down, try pulling it out of your
    face with a half ponytail, a headband or a hairband, or a
    barrette.
