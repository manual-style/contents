Playing sports is a fun way to stay in shape, but between the sweat and
the baggy uniforms, it isn’t always the most attractive activity. But
sometimes you want to look good, like when you’re trying to impress a
crush or playing in front of a large crowd. By upgrading your style,
taking care of yourself, and becoming a better athlete, you’ll not only
play like a champion, you’ll look like one, too.

## Steps

### Improving Your Style

1.  Wear athletic clothes that highlight the features you’re most proud
    of. Show off the parts of your body that you love and feel confident
    about. For example, if you’re a girl, wear a pair of short spandex
    shorts to flatter your long legs or a crop top to show off your
    toned abs. Guys can wear sleeveless tank tops to flaunt sculpted
    shoulders and
    arms.[1]![](Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_1_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_1_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Make sure the clothes you choose are appropriate for the sport
        you’re playing. For example, super short shorts would not be
        allowed in golf, which calls for knee-length shorts.[2]
    -   You can also modify your athletic clothes to make them more
        flattering. Try pulling a shirt back with hair tie or rolling
        the waistband of your shorts once.
2.  Choose a uniform in a size that is flattering yet comfortable. You
    need room to move freely so avoid getting a uniform that’s too
    tight. However, a shirt that’s too baggy or pants that are too big
    also won’t do you any favors appearance-wise. Oversized uniforms end
    up looking
    sloppy.![](Look_Your_Best_During_Gym_Class_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Look_Your_Best_During_Gym_Class_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   A uniform that doesn’t fit well can affect your performance too
        if you’re constantly tugging at it.
    -   Uniforms can be cut differently than regular clothes so you
        can’t rely on the size on the tag. Ask your coach if you can try
        on a couple of sizes before you order yours.
3.  Wear your hair pulled back in a sporty style if you have long hair.
    Keeping your hair out of your eyes is a must. Opt for simple styles
    that only require an elastic band rather than more complicated ones
    that take a lot of accessories or time to put together. Both guys
    and girls with long hair can try a [sleek
    ponytail](Make_a_High_Ponytail "wikilink") or [messy
    bun](Make_a_Messy_Bun "wikilink"). Girls might also wear braids,
    whether it’s 2 boxer braids or a [single French
    braid](French_Braid "wikilink").[3]![](Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_2_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_2_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Elastic headbands are a fun athletic accessory to add to your
        look. Look for ones in pretty prints and colors that match your
        uniform or outfit.
    -   Avoid hard metal or plastic hair accessories like clips or bobby
        pins. They aren’t allowed in many sports leagues and can hurt if
        you get hit in the head.
4.  Keep your makeup light and natural if you’re a girl who wants to
    wear it. Don’t wear a full face of makeup while playing sports. If
    you want to wear a little makeup, opt for sheer, sweat-proof
    products that won’t smudge. For example, apply waterproof mascara to
    your lashes or swipe tinted moisturizer on your cheeks for a touch
    of
    bronze.[4]![](Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_3_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_3_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Foundation and concealer are tricky to wear when you’re
        sweating. But your best bet is one that’s water-based which will
        stick to your skin better without clogging your pores as much.
    -   Give your lips a pop of color with a tinted lip balm or a lip
        stain that’s close to your natural lip color, like a pale pink
        or nude.[5]

### Taking Care of Your Body

1.  Wear scented deodorant to prevent bad body odor and sweat stains.
    It’s tough to feel good about how you look when you reek of body
    odor or when your shirt is soaked under your arms with embarrassing
    pit stains. Apply a layer of deodorant to your armpits before you
    play sports. Choose a fresh, subtle scent that will cover up any bad
    smells.[6]![](Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_5_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_5_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Deodorant comes in all different varieties like gel roll-on,
        stick, and spray. If you’re someone who gets really sweaty or
        smelly, look for a clinical strength deodorant.
    -   In a pinch, you can use hand sanitizer in place of deodorant.[7]
    -   Keep a travel-size deodorant in your sports bag to reapply
        during practice or a game.
2.  Protect your skin in outdoor sports with sunscreen that’s at least
    SPF 30. Skipping the sunscreen could result in sunburn, peeling
    skin, and even skin cancer if it’s a regular habit. Apply sunscreen
    that’s SPF 30 or higher on all exposed skin at least 15 minutes
    before heading outside.[8]
    ![](Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_4_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_4_Version_3.jpg")
    -   A water-resistant or sweat-proof formula will hold up best and
        not run into your eyes if you’re sweating.
    -   Reapply as needed or at least every 2 hours. If you’re sweating
        profusely, you’ll need to reapply more frequently.[9]
3.  Wipe up excess sweat often with a hand towel. Dripping in sweat
    isn't always a good look, especially if you're wearing makeup and
    it's running down your face. Bring a small hand towel with you to
    wipe yourself off when
    needed.![](Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_6_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_6_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Microfiber towels are a good choice because they’re soft,
        absorbent, and won’t be too rough on your face.
    -   Keep your hand towel in your gym bag or on the sidelines so you
        can easily grab it during breaks.
4.  Drink plenty of water before, during, and after playing sports. Stay
    hydrated so your body can function properly and so you look
    energized and fresh. How much you need depends on your body size,
    your activity level, and the climate you're playing in. At a
    minimum, drink of water before exercising, then of water every 15-20
    minutes while you're
    playing.[10]![](Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_7_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_7_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Bonus: Drinking a lot of water keeps your skin clear and
        glowing.
    -   Continue hydrating after you play sports. It's especially
        important in the 30 minutes following your activity.
    -   If you're exercising for longer than 90 minutes, have a sports
        drink with electrolytes to replenish your body's glycogen
        levels.[11]

### Becoming a Better Athlete

1.  Play more confidently by using positive self-talk. Confidence is one
    of the most attractive qualities a person can have.[12] To boost
    your self-esteem and get rid any insecurities or negative thoughts,
    brainstorm at least 5 things you love about yourself as an athlete
    or things you're good at when it comes to your
    sport.[13]![](Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_8_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_8_Version_3.jpg")
    -   For example, you could tell yourself, “I am proud of my
        leadership abilities,” “I am proud that I can consistently sink
        3-pointers,” or “I have the best 40-yard dash time on the team.”
    -   If you're having trouble thinking of positive things, ask your
        friends, family, teammates, and coaches what they think you're
        good at.
    -   Write your list down on a piece of paper or in the Notes app on
        your phone to have as a reminder when you need it.
2.  Show your passion for the sport by giving 100% effort on the field.
    Being passionate and committed to what you’re doing is a great
    quality. It sounds counterintuitive, but the less time you spend
    worrying about what you look like and the more time you spend
    focusing on playing your best and giving all you’ve got, the better
    you'll
    look.[14]![](Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_9_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_9_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Putting in the work and trying your hardest will make you a more
        skilled athlete which will make you more confident, too.
    -   For example, if you're always taking the shot when you have the
        chance on the soccer field, eventually you'll get better at
        shooting and scoring. And everyone loves the lead scorer!
3.  Embrace the endorphins to boost your mood. Playing sports and
    exercising increases chemicals such as endorphins, dopamine, and sex
    hormones. These chemicals naturally make you feel happier, which
    improves your mood and energy level. Don't be afraid to smile while
    you're playing. Happiness is a great look for
    anyone.[15]![](Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_11_Version_3.jpg "fig:Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_11_Version_3.jpg")
    -   Even 30 minutes of exercise increases endorphins.
4.  Maintain a positive attitude toward your teammates and competitors.
    Getting along with others and being upbeat makes you look good.[16]
    Respect your teammates, be a team player, and be a good sport to the
    other team.[17] To improve your attitude, focus on what's going well
    in a game or what skills you're good at. For example, maybe you're
    losing but you just made an awesome
    pass.![](Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_12.jpg "fig:Be_Sexy_While_Playing_Sports_(Girls)_Step_12.jpg")
    -   Positive visualization can help you reassure yourself and keep a
        positive outlook, too. Imagine yourself performing well in a
        detailed scenario, like hitting the match point to win the
        game.[18]
    -   Congratulate teammates when they block a shot or score a goal.
        You can do the same for your opponents, too, as awkward as it
        may feel. It shows grace and class.
