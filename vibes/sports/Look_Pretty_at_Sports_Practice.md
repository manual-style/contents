Ever feel sweaty and gross during sports practice? No problem. Read on
to look better while playing sports. This is not for swimming and other
sports that gets your hair and makeup smudged.

## Steps

1.  Hair. There are lots of things you can do with your hair. Some of
    the cutest looks for sports practice are a slightly messy ponytail,
    a ponytail teased at the crown, ponytail with a bump in the front,
    side braids, french braid, or just a ponytail with a really bright
    headband. The reason I didn't mention any buns? Because most people
    tend to put them in WAY too tight, and that looks really weird.
    Unless, of course, you dance, you should never do a messy bun! It
    usually starts to unravel and fall out. Even if you don't think it
    does? It
    does.![](Look_Pretty_at_Sports_Practice_Step_1.jpg "fig:Look_Pretty_at_Sports_Practice_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Makeup. Makeup can be bad for your skin if it's mixed with sweat,
    especially if you are acne-prone. If you have oily skin, it will
    melt off! Which is why when you play sports, never ever use liquid
    foundation. Even if you don't notice it, it is melting off and it
    looks really weird. try using a light or translucent powder,
    concealer, waterproof mascara, and lip-gloss. Trust me, use a tinted
    mascara version and a nude-ish, medium pink lipgloss/lipstain.
    You'll look great! Also bring along blotting papers if you have oily
    skin. Dry skin? Bring along a small tube of
    moisturizer.![](Look_Pretty_at_Sports_Practice_Step_2.jpg "fig:Look_Pretty_at_Sports_Practice_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Clothes. Top: If you're playing a school sport, you may not be
    allowed to wear tank tops. But that's fine, because it looks kinda
    weird. Just wear a loose-fitting (but not too loose) tee shirt over
    a sports bra. The trick is to pull on a really brightly-colored cami
    (if possible, be sure it has a color from the tee in it) on
    underneath the tee. Bunch up just a bit of the front into a ponytail
    holder, and tuck it under. It looks very cute and unique! Bottom:
    Wear nicely-fitting shorts. No shorter than your wrist when you arms
    is hanging by your side, no longer than an inch and a half above the
    knee. Make sure they do not poof out; it looks very awkward! Also,
    unless you play volleyball where you wear spandex anyway, wear
    spandex underneath your athletic shorts. Shoes: Get a quality pair
    of athletic shoes. If you're a runner, use only Asics. You'll see
    that's what everyone wears because they come in cute colors, and
    don't give you shin splints. For soccer, get Pumas or Nikes. For
    volleyball, try Asics or just any other kind of court
    shoes.![](Look_Pretty_at_Sports_Practice_Step_3.jpg "fig:Look_Pretty_at_Sports_Practice_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Pack a bag. In it, put in some cute sweats that aren't too loose, an
    extra cami, sports bra, tee, socks, and shorts. Also pack your
    makeup bag. Bring along some strong deodorant, because if you don't
    sweat too much, they might have you do a surprisingly grueling
    workout. Bring lotion, and a light body spray. Now you're set! Toss
    in your cell, and you're all ready to
    go!![](Look_Pretty_at_Sports_Practice_Step_4.jpg "fig:Look_Pretty_at_Sports_Practice_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Bring some water if you don't want to use the nasty school fountain
    or use a
    friend's.![](Look_Pretty_at_Sports_Practice_Step_5.jpg "fig:Look_Pretty_at_Sports_Practice_Step_5.jpg")

## Tips

-   Make sure both your cami and tee shirt fit well.
-   Smile and look like your having fun-even if you're not. Think about
    it; you'll be hanging out with the other girls on your team, who are
    fumy, sweaty, and exhausted, you'll be over smiling (but don't just
    smile at nothing!) and looking like you're having a blast.
-   If you're uniform is too big (mine always are), then play with it!
    If it hangs so you can see your sports bra, either wear a bright one
    or wear a pretty cami in your team color on it. So if your top is
    red and bottoms are blue, then wear a blue cami. You can also get
    permission to stitch it higher or cinch it at the bottom. If you
    have to tuck it in, don't make it too tight; that looks SO weird.
    But don't make it too loose, either.
-   Always wear no-show white socks! The ones with a bit of crew
    sock-look to them are SO ugly!
-   If you want cute colored shoes, don't buy all hot pink with a brown
    Nike swoosh. They're ugly! Buy them in white with a pink Nike
    swoosh, maybe. Just be sure they're one solid color, black or white
    ONLY (preferably white). Then, go for color.

## Warnings

-   Focus on the sport. This way, you'll be good at it, and pretty,
    getting you more good attention!
-   Do not overdo it by wearing pretty but uncomfortable clothes
-   Only wear you're two team colors at once.
