Somehow, putting together cute and sporty outfits is a daunting task.
Especially in high school, when keeping the balance seems impossible! No
longer. With the help of this article, anyone in the world can put
together universally identifiable cute, sporty outfits.

## Steps

1.  Go over what you're going to be doing. Are you just going to school,
    or are you going to the mall? Are you going to a church/temple or a
    party? Sometimes, being overdressed is good but most times, it
    isn't.![](Put_Together_Cute,_Sporty_Outfits_Step_1.jpg "fig:Put_Together_Cute,_Sporty_Outfits_Step_1.jpg")
    -   School:
        -   Sweatpants. The kind that's tapered at the ankles? Those are
            adorable when paired with a light graphic tee, and a zip-up
            hoodie.
        -   But if you want to dress up a bit, try skinny jeans, with
            clean sneakers, a long sleeve tee (with cute stripes if you
            want) and a sports brand track hoodie (Adidas, Nike, etc.)
    -   Hanging Out:
        -   Fitted. Not tight. Fitted. Fitted tank tops with pretty
            details, fitted graphic tees, and if you feel like being
            sloppy, fitted Hensley. But when going out with friends,
            wearing loose clothes makes you look gross and lazy.
    -   Church/Temple:
        -   Look presentable and nice. This is not the time for
            sweatpants, but sporty doesn't mean lacy, frilly and
            disgustingly pink! So when it's cold, skinny jeans are fine.
            But only in dark wash, or stone wash, and no rips or faded
            spots. Pair them with a dolman-sleeve top (the ones with the
            loose sleeves and a tight torso) or a feminine tank top (the
            loose ones, with winged hems on the sides) with a clean,
            cropped cardigan and clean flats.
        -   If you want to wear something different, and it's warm
            weather, try those cute, sporty dresses from Abercrombie.
            The ones with a ruffle skirt and a tank-styled top? They are
            really cute, sporty and comfortable at the same time, and a
            go-to for sporty girls at fancy events. Gladiator sandals or
            even wedge heels look nice with them, but only for
            church/temple cute sporty outfits
    -   Party:
        -   In the summer, cute, sporty denim shorts are a must! When
            you pair them with a pastel spaghetti-strap tanktop or silky
            cami you're pretty much ready to party in a sporty cute way.
            In the wintertime, try leggings, a smocked tank top or
            floral, cotton tunic and flats or Converse low-top shoes.
            Jackets can just be hoodies and the like.
2.  Accessorize. Accessories are easy to deal with, even if you don't
    like them. Wristbands and charm necklaces look good with everything,
    and if you have those cute rings from Forever21, the ones that go
    through more than one finger, wear those at church or a party. It
    looks sporty and cool. Hoop earrings look sporty every once in a
    while, but small studs are preferred for daily
    use.![](Put_Together_Cute,_Sporty_Outfits_Step_2.jpg "fig:Put_Together_Cute,_Sporty_Outfits_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Do your hair. Hair can make or break an outfit. If it's
    straightened, leave it down and pin the bangs back, to get it out of
    your face. If it's wet, comb it up into a high pony, and accessorize
    with a thin, sports headband. Prewrap is cool, too. And if you like
    to just leave your hair in it's natural texture, pin it up with a
    claw clip, in a messy
    bun.![](Put_Together_Cute,_Sporty_Outfits_Step_3.jpg "fig:Put_Together_Cute,_Sporty_Outfits_Step_3.jpg")

## Tips

-   Keep hair it's natural color and don't fuss with your hair cut too
    much. If you know you'll fidget with them, don't get bangs!
-   Makeup really does make an outfit girlier, so wear chapstick and
    blush. It lets people know that you are sporty, but you still care.
-   Some good stores are: Hollister, Old Navy, Sports Authority and
    Forever 21 (for more dressy stuff).
-   Claw clips are fun to use. Just twist the hair up and put the clip
    at the bottom of the twist!

## Warnings

-   Do not spend too much money on clothes. Work with what you have, and
    if you must spend a little more cash, make sure you have a plan to
    replenish it. Money is too hard to come by these days to waste it on
    belts and boots.
-   Never wear revealing clothes on a daily basis. It just diminishes
    your self-respect.
