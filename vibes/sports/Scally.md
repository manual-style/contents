A **Scally** is a fashion identity associated with the northern soul
music scene and UK football hooliganism that were based in Liverpool and
Northwest England in the 1970s. Along with the Perry boys of Manchester
and the Soulboys of Southeast England, Scallies are considered the
direct predecessor to the [Casual](/Casual_(subculture) "wikilink")
subculture that became popular in the 1980s.

## Characteristics

The stereotype of a Liverpool-based scally consists of:

-   Short hair and gel-styled for men
-   Scraped back, hairsprayed for women
-   Burberry cap, worn at a tilted angle
-   Gold jewelry, curb chains, bracelets, sovereign rings
-   Big hooped earrings
-   Dark-colored tracksuits, often tucked into their socks
-   Hooded tops, polo shirts with brand names, collar popped up
-   Trainers during the day, loafers in the night
-   Brands: Henri Lloyd, Hackett, Nike, Adidas, Reebok

## Origin

### 1970s

Although the adoration of brand name clothing stems from the Northern
Soul scene, it is generally regarded that the first scallies were
supporters of Liverpool FC who stood on the Anfield Road Terrace end of
their football stadium. The earliest occurrence of this new fashion
trend was evident in the Spring of 1977 where Adidas Samba footwear and
Adidas t-shirts became en vogue with the Liverpool youth.

By the August 1977, Charity Shield game between Liverpool and Manchester
United Liverpool fans were noticeable with their new look- compared to
Mancunians and Londoners who still dressed in the typical airwear 1970s
look accompanied by wearing the respective colours of their teams.

Young Liverpool entrepreneur Robert Wade Smith — then an employee for a
Liverpool department store — noticed the endless demand for sports
footwear in Liverpool — which at one time outsold London by three to
one. Smith decided to open his own store and hired a van to bring back
rare sportswear from Europe which were difficult to buy in the UK. Wade
Smith is now closed down.

### 1980s

By the 1980s the 'Liverpool look' (it was rarely called scally back
then) went overground and its 'look' was fed by traveling football fans
who returned from Everton and Liverpool games in Europe with designer
sports goods.

1981 also saw the Toxteth riots in Liverpool and the economy stagnated
and fuelled high levels of unemployment. All these factors along with
Liverpool fans becoming bloated on success — saw Anfield attendances for
football games drop. It also was the beginning of the end for the
Liverpool scally. With the rest of the UK following the new trends now
almost religiously and economic factors making expensive sportswear
purchases illogical — Liverpool abandoned the scally scene and began to
'dress down' with a scruffy look.

Typical of the contradictions that are associated with the scally during
the 1980s was their penchant for golf (due to the brand name clothing
that pervades the sport) and several 1970s supergroups notably Genesis
and Pink Floyd.

### 1990s

The 1990s saw a pivotal change in the characteristics of the scally with
national re-invention through the comedy sketches by Harry Enfield. His
tracksuit-wearing characters "The Scousers", with their phrases such as
"calm down, calm down!" and "eh, eh, eh!", gave the scally a perhaps
unwelcome national media exposure that, ironically, the Liverpool youth
began to imitate.

## Impact

-   The Scallies' tracksuit attire has been cited as the earliest known
    prototype of the dress aesthetics associated with British
    [Casual](/Casual_(subculture) "wikilink") subculture, even preceding
    its Manchester-based contemporary rivals, the [Perry
    boys](/Perry_boys "wikilink").
