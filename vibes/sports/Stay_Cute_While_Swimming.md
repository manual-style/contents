Summer is quickly approaching, along with it swimming and sun! A lot of
times we can abandon fashion and just swim, not really caring what we
look like. But how do you look cute and still enjoy yourself? It's easy!
Look out summer: Here I come!

## Steps

1.  Choose a flattering swimsuit. Your swimsuit makes all the
    difference. If you like how it looks, you'll be happy-chances are,
    if you like it, you'll look better in
    it.![](Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_1.jpg "fig:Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_1.jpg")
2.  Remove make-up. If you're planning on going underwater, take off
    your makeup. This takes away the chance of it smearing and making
    you look like a raccoon. On the other hand, if you're just sun
    tanning and hanging out, leave it
    on!![](Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_2.jpg "fig:Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_2.jpg")
3.  Put on some fun summer stud earrings. If they're studs, they won't
    come off or damage as easily as dangle earrings
    would.![](Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_3.jpg "fig:Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_3.jpg")
4.  Paint your nails with bold colors and patterns that match your
    swimsuit.![](Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_4.jpg "fig:Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_4.jpg")
5.  Wear flip-flops. There are many brands and styles to choose from;
    they can really do a lot to accent your
    look.![](Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_5.jpg "fig:Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_5.jpg")
6.  Wear sunglasses. Sunglasses always look cute and stylish, plus they
    help to block the sun. Double
    points!![](Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_6.jpg "fig:Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_6.jpg")
7.  Wear your hair down. This gives a more natural look and doesn't flop
    around like ponytails and buns have the tendency to
    do.![](Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_7.jpg "fig:Stay_Cute_While_Swimming_Step_7.jpg")

## Tips

-   If you plan on actual swimming and not just sun tanning, don't wear
    any necklaces. They can get rusty and you might run the risk of
    losing them. Lucky for you, ankle bracelets and stud earrings work
    great, so stock up!
-   Pin up your bangs when you're swimming or put them in a braid. That
    way, as they dry, they don't flop into your face.
